(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\n\nguteksk7/Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway's relationship with Apple, emphasizing the moderate correlation between their stock performances. While positive results from Apple could have a slight upward impact on Berkshire's stock, historical data shows that significant moves in Apple's stock do not translate to the same for Berkshire. Moreover, the article suggests a cautious stance on investing in Berkshire right now due to its current valuation and lack of expected growth. Therefore, the probability of stock price movement for Berkshire Hathaway based on Apple's upcoming report is likely low, leaning towards stability or a slight decrease. As a result, the probabilities reflect more caution than optimism for a price rise, and a relatively higher probability of a slight decline based on the sentiment expressed in the report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to the earnings growth of big tech companies, including Apple, due to increased competition in the AI space. The market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek indicates investor sensitivity to this risk. While the article points out that Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow significantly, the emergence of DeepSeek raises concerns about whether these expectations will be met. Given Apple's exposure to the overall tech market sentiment and its dependence on continued growth in its segments, this news presents a negative outlook in the short term. Because the article refers to recent events followed by positive future earnings outlook, the probability of a short term fall is high, followed by a slight chance of rise as investors reconcile positive outlooks with current market movements.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The overall market is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek's AI model and the anticipation of a Fed rate hike, which could negatively affect tech stocks.  However, Apple's earnings report this week is a significant factor. Strong earnings could outweigh the negative market sentiment, while weaker-than-expected results could exacerbate the downward pressure.  The probability estimates are made considering the overall market uncertainty and the importance of Apple's upcoming earnings report, which has a potentially high impact on its stock price.  The probabilities lean slightly towards a price fall given the negative market context, but a significant positive surprise in the earnings could easily change the direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver, declining revenue in China, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and competitive pressures in the AI and tech markets. The analyst's comments suggest that Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, and the lack of immediate catalysts could weigh on investor sentiment. Given these points, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed. This has led to iPhones being sold for thousands of dollars on eBay. However, this frenzy is likely short-lived and may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban's uncertainty and the potential for TikTok to be reinstated or sold could influence investor sentiment, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. The report highlights that while the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market is unsustainable, the strong fundamentals of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple make a catch-down scenario unlikely. However, the report also cautions that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. Considering Apple's investments in AI and its position in the AI value chain, the news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. But, given the already high valuation of Apple's stock, the potential for upside may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics. While it mentions Apple's earnings report on Jan. 30, which may have an indirect effect on Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, the article concludes that rushed investments in Berkshire Hathaway should not be encouraged based on Apple's report. The article suggests Berkshire's current valuation and analyst expectations do not justify immediate action.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple and its implications for Berkshire Hathaway. While there's a moderate correlation between their stock performances, historical data shows that strong earnings from Apple do not significantly impact Berkshire's stock price. Additionally, the article suggests cautious sentiment regarding investing in Berkshire due to its current valuation and limited growth prospects. Consequently, probabilities lean towards stability or a slight decrease in Berkshire's stock price, with limited chances of a rise. Given the mixed sentiment around Apple and its potential impact on Berkshire, I've balanced the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to Big Tech earnings, including Apple, due to competition from companies like DeepSeek. The market's reaction to DeepSeek's announcement (significant pre-market declines in major tech stocks) suggests investor concern. Despite projected earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven', the emergence of a tangible competitor raises concerns about meeting these high expectations. Given Apple's large market capitalization and sensitivity to broader tech sentiment of the 'Magnificent Seven', the news is negative. The other models also see downward trend given this news, despite predicting a rise sometimes given their own information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The broader tech sector is experiencing a downturn fueled by the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model and anticipation of a Fed interest rate hike. This negative market sentiment creates downward pressure on Apple's stock. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a crucial factor. Strong earnings could mitigate the negative market influence, while weak results would likely exacerbate the downward pressure.  The previous predictions are varied, some leaning towards a price fall due to the negative market context and concerns about the competitive AI landscape. Others indicate a higher probability of a rise, based on the strength of Apple's fundamentals and its position in the AI market.  Considering this conflicting information, along with the overall uncertainty, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall due to the immediate negative market sentiment, but a sizable portion of probability remains assigned to a price rise based on the possibility of positive earnings news counteracting the negative market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its potential as a growth driver, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment. Analyst comments suggest that Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, indicating a lack of immediate catalysts. While the company remains a strong player in the tech industry, the news leans slightly negative due to the mentioned challenges and lack of significant growth drivers in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed. This situation is likely short-lived and may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban's uncertainty and the potential for TikTok to be reinstated or sold could influence investor sentiment, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials. However, the frenzy around iPhones with TikTok installed might be perceived as a minor positive for Apple's stock in the short term due to increased demand, but this is not substantial enough to drive significant long-term growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials.

Considering Apple's investments in AI and its position in the AI value chain, the news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. But, given the already high valuation of Apple's stock, the potential for upside may be limited. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. However, the news article's focus on Apple's AI investments and its strong position in the AI landscape suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics, with indirect references to Apple's impending earnings report. While the earnings report could impact Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, the article suggests caution regarding immediate investments in Berkshire. Factors such as the current valuation, recent lack of stock buybacks, and modest analyst predictions contribute to a cautious outlook. Although Apple's performance can influence Berkshire's stock, the probabilities lean more towards stability or a slight decrease due to the mixed signals presented in the news.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the news indicates that while there is potential positivity surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings report, there is also significant negative sentiment in the broader tech market, influenced by competition and recent market dynamics. Historical data shows that strong results from Apple have not led to significant increases in Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, suggesting that any positive impact may be minimal. The overall caution regarding Berkshire's valuation and growth prospects, combined with the mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's performance, leads to a higher probability of a price fall for Berkshire Hathaway in light of this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to Big Tech earnings, including Apple, due to competition from DeepSeek in the AI space. The market's initial reaction, with significant pre-market declines in major tech stocks, indicates investor concern. While projected earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' is still expected, the emergence of a tangible AI competitor like DeepSeek raises concerns about meeting these high expectations. The article notes that big tech earnings have been a key pillar of the bull market, and any disruption could have a significant impact. While Apple's strengths and AI investments were discussed in previous rounds and could be positives, the immediate negative impact from the AI competition news outweighs these factors. Also note that in the previous rounds, most of the models are slightly in favor of a fall in stock price. Given Apple's significant market capitalization and sensitivity to broader tech sentiment, the news is deemed predominantly negative. Thus, more weight is given to the probability of stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The overall market sentiment is negative due to DeepSeek's new AI model and the anticipated Fed rate hike. This negative market context exerts downward pressure on tech stocks, including Apple. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a crucial factor.  Strong earnings could offset the negative market impact, while disappointing results could exacerbate the decline.  The previous predictions are varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance and the broader market conditions.  Some models lean towards a price fall, emphasizing the negative market sentiment and competitive pressures. Others suggest a higher probability of a rise, highlighting Apple's strong fundamentals and AI investments.  Considering this mixed information and the weight of the negative market factors, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the potential for a significant positive surprise in earnings to shift the balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with several negative factors outweighing potential positives. Key negatives include skepticism about AI as a growth driver for Apple, declining revenue in China (a significant market), weak performance in the Wearables segment, and competitive pressures in the AI space from Chinese models like DeepSeek. Analyst comments suggest Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, and there's a lack of immediate catalysts. While Apple remains a strong player in the tech industry, the combination of these factors suggests a slightly negative impact on the stock price in the short term. The previous predictions also largely lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, though some models acknowledge potential for a rise (possibly due to strong fundamentals).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed.

The ban's uncertainty and the potential for TikTok to be reinstated or sold could influence investor sentiment, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials. However, the frenzy around iPhones with TikTok installed might be perceived as a minor positive for Apple's stock in the short term due to increased demand, but this is not substantial enough to drive significant long-term growth. Considering the mixed sentiment and previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments and its position in the AI landscape, highlighting the company's strong focus on AI hardware, hyperscalers, developers, integrators, and essentials.
