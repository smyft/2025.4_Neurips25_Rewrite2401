A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway's relationship with Apple, emphasizing the moderate correlation between their stock performances. While positive results from Apple could have a slight upward impact on Berkshire's stock, historical data shows that significant moves in Apple's stock do not translate to the same for Berkshire. Moreover, the article suggests a cautious stance on investing in Berkshire right now due to its current valuation and lack of expected growth. Therefore, the probability of stock price movement for Berkshire Hathaway based on Apple's upcoming report is likely low, leaning towards stability or a slight decrease. As a result, the probabilities reflect more caution than optimism for a price rise, and a relatively higher probability of a slight decline based on the sentiment expressed in the report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to the earnings growth of big tech companies, including Apple, due to increased competition in the AI space. The market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek indicates investor sensitivity to this risk. While the article points out that Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow significantly, the emergence of DeepSeek raises concerns about whether these expectations will be met. Given Apple's exposure to the overall tech market sentiment and its dependence on continued growth in its segments, this news presents a negative outlook in the short term. Because the article refers to recent events followed by positive future earnings outlook, the probability of a short term fall is high, followed by a slight chance of rise as investors reconcile positive outlooks with current market movements.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The overall market is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek's AI model and the anticipation of a Fed rate hike, which could negatively affect tech stocks.  However, Apple's earnings report this week is a significant factor. Strong earnings could outweigh the negative market sentiment, while weaker-than-expected results could exacerbate the downward pressure.  The probability estimates are made considering the overall market uncertainty and the importance of Apple's upcoming earnings report, which has a potentially high impact on its stock price.  The probabilities lean slightly towards a price fall given the negative market context, but a significant positive surprise in the earnings could easily change the direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver, declining revenue in China, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and competitive pressures in the AI and tech markets. The analyst's comments suggest that Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, and the lack of immediate catalysts could weigh on investor sentiment. Given these points, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed. This has led to iPhones being sold for thousands of dollars on eBay. However, this frenzy is likely short-lived and may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban's uncertainty and the potential for TikTok to be reinstated or sold could influence investor sentiment, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. The report highlights that while the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market is unsustainable, the strong fundamentals of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple make a catch-down scenario unlikely. However, the report also cautions that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. Considering Apple's investments in AI and its position in the AI value chain, the news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. But, given the already high valuation of Apple's stock, the potential for upside may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics. While it mentions Apple's earnings report on Jan. 30, which may have an indirect effect on Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, the article concludes that rushed investments in Berkshire Hathaway should not be encouraged based on Apple's report. The article suggests Berkshire's current valuation and analyst expectations do not justify immediate action.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple and its implications for Berkshire Hathaway. While there's a moderate correlation between their stock performances, historical data shows that strong earnings from Apple do not significantly impact Berkshire's stock price. Additionally, the article suggests cautious sentiment regarding investing in Berkshire due to its current valuation and limited growth prospects. Consequently, probabilities lean towards stability or a slight decrease in Berkshire's stock price, with limited chances of a rise. Given the mixed sentiment around Apple and its potential impact on Berkshire, I've balanced the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to Big Tech earnings, including Apple, due to competition from companies like DeepSeek. The market's reaction to DeepSeek's announcement (significant pre-market declines in major tech stocks) suggests investor concern. Despite projected earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven', the emergence of a tangible competitor raises concerns about meeting these high expectations. Given Apple's large market capitalization and sensitivity to broader tech sentiment of the 'Magnificent Seven', the news is negative. The other models also see downward trend given this news, despite predicting a rise sometimes given their own information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The broader tech sector is experiencing a downturn fueled by the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model and anticipation of a Fed interest rate hike. This negative market sentiment creates downward pressure on Apple's stock. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a crucial factor. Strong earnings could mitigate the negative market influence, while weak results would likely exacerbate the downward pressure.  The previous predictions are varied, some leaning towards a price fall due to the negative market context and concerns about the competitive AI landscape. Others indicate a higher probability of a rise, based on the strength of Apple's fundamentals and its position in the AI market.  Considering this conflicting information, along with the overall uncertainty, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall due to the immediate negative market sentiment, but a sizable portion of probability remains assigned to a price rise based on the possibility of positive earnings news counteracting the negative market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its potential as a growth driver, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment. Analyst comments suggest that Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, indicating a lack of immediate catalysts. While the company remains a strong player in the tech industry, the news leans slightly negative due to the mentioned challenges and lack of significant growth drivers in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed. This situation is likely short-lived and may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban's uncertainty and the potential for TikTok to be reinstated or sold could influence investor sentiment, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials. However, the frenzy around iPhones with TikTok installed might be perceived as a minor positive for Apple's stock in the short term due to increased demand, but this is not substantial enough to drive significant long-term growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation.

Considering Apple's investments in AI and its position in the AI value chain, the news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. But, given the already high valuation of Apple's stock, the potential for upside may be limited. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. However, the news article's focus on Apple's AI investments and its strong position in the AI landscape suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics, with indirect references to Apple's impending earnings report. While the earnings report could impact Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, the article suggests caution regarding immediate investments in Berkshire. Factors such as the current valuation, recent lack of stock buybacks, and modest analyst predictions contribute to a cautious outlook. Although Apple's performance can influence Berkshire's stock, the probabilities lean more towards stability or a slight decrease due to the mixed signals presented in the news.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the news indicates that while there is potential positivity surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings report, there is also significant negative sentiment in the broader tech market, influenced by competition and recent market dynamics. Historical data shows that strong results from Apple have not led to significant increases in Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, suggesting that any positive impact may be minimal. The overall caution regarding Berkshire's valuation and growth prospects, combined with the mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's performance, leads to a higher probability of a price fall for Berkshire Hathaway in light of this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to Big Tech earnings, including Apple, due to competition from DeepSeek in the AI space. The market's initial reaction, with significant pre-market declines in major tech stocks, indicates investor concern. While projected earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' is still expected, the emergence of a tangible AI competitor like DeepSeek raises concerns about meeting these high expectations. The article notes that big tech earnings have been a key pillar of the bull market, and any disruption could have a significant impact. While Apple's strengths and AI investments were discussed in previous rounds and could be positives, the immediate negative impact from the AI competition news outweighs these factors. Also note that in the previous rounds, most of the models are slightly in favor of a fall in stock price. Given Apple's significant market capitalization and sensitivity to broader tech sentiment, the news is deemed predominantly negative. Thus, more weight is given to the probability of stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The overall market sentiment is negative due to DeepSeek's new AI model and the anticipated Fed rate hike. This negative market context exerts downward pressure on tech stocks, including Apple. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a crucial factor.  Strong earnings could offset the negative market impact, while disappointing results could exacerbate the decline.  The previous predictions are varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance and the broader market conditions.  Some models lean towards a price fall, emphasizing the negative market sentiment and competitive pressures. Others suggest a higher probability of a rise, highlighting Apple's strong fundamentals and AI investments.  Considering this mixed information and the weight of the negative market factors, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the potential for a significant positive surprise in earnings to shift the balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with several negative factors outweighing potential positives. Key negatives include skepticism about AI as a growth driver for Apple, declining revenue in China (a significant market), weak performance in the Wearables segment, and competitive pressures in the AI space from Chinese models like DeepSeek. Analyst comments suggest Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, and there's a lack of immediate catalysts. While Apple remains a strong player in the tech industry, the combination of these factors suggests a slightly negative impact on the stock price in the short term. The previous predictions also largely lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, though some models acknowledge potential for a rise (possibly due to strong fundamentals).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed.

The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials. However, the frenzy around iPhones with TikTok installed might be perceived as a minor positive for Apple's stock in the short term due to increased demand, but this is not substantial enough to drive significant long-term growth. Considering the mixed sentiment and previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments and its position in the AI landscape, highlighting the company's strong focus on AI hardware, hyperscalers, developers, integrators, and essentials.
