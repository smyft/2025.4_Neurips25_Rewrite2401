(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway's relationship with Apple, emphasizing the moderate correlation between their stock performances. While positive results from Apple could have a slight upward impact on Berkshire's stock, historical data shows that significant moves in Apple's stock do not translate to the same for Berkshire. Moreover, the article suggests a cautious stance on investing in Berkshire right now due to its current valuation and lack of expected growth. Therefore, the probability of stock price movement for Berkshire Hathaway based on Apple's upcoming report is likely low, leaning towards stability or a slight decrease. As a result, the probabilities reflect more caution than optimism for a price rise, and a relatively higher probability of a slight decline based on the sentiment expressed in the report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to the earnings growth of big tech companies, including Apple, due to increased competition in the AI space. The market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek indicates investor sensitivity to this risk. While the article points out that Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow significantly, the emergence of DeepSeek raises concerns about whether these expectations will be met. Given Apple's exposure to the overall tech market sentiment and its dependence on continued growth in its segments, this news presents a negative outlook in the short term. Because the article refers to recent events followed by positive future earnings outlook, the probability of a short term fall is high, followed by a slight chance of rise as investors reconcile positive outlooks with current market movements.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The overall market is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek's AI model and the anticipation of a Fed rate hike, which could negatively affect tech stocks.  However, Apple's earnings report this week is a significant factor. Strong earnings could outweigh the negative market sentiment, while weaker-than-expected results could exacerbate the downward pressure.  The probability estimates are made considering the overall market uncertainty and the importance of Apple's upcoming earnings report, which has a potentially high impact on its stock price.  The probabilities lean slightly towards a price fall given the negative market context, but a significant positive surprise in the earnings could easily change the direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver, declining revenue in China, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and competitive pressures in the AI and tech markets. The analyst's comments suggest that Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, and the lack of immediate catalysts could weigh on investor sentiment. Given these points, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed. This has led to iPhones being sold for thousands of dollars on eBay. However, this frenzy is likely short-lived and may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban's uncertainty and the potential for TikTok to be reinstated or sold could influence investor sentiment, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. The report highlights that while the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market is unsustainable, the strong fundamentals of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple make a catch-down scenario unlikely. However, the report also cautions that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. Considering Apple's investments in AI and its position in the AI value chain, the news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. But, given the already high valuation of Apple's stock, the potential for upside may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics. While it mentions Apple's earnings report on Jan. 30, which may have an indirect effect on Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, the article concludes that rushed investments in Berkshire Hathaway should not be encouraged based on Apple's report. The article suggests Berkshire's current valuation and analyst expectations do not justify immediate action.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple and its implications for Berkshire Hathaway. While there's a moderate correlation between their stock performances, historical data shows that strong earnings from Apple do not significantly impact Berkshire's stock price. Additionally, the article suggests cautious sentiment regarding investing in Berkshire due to its current valuation and limited growth prospects. Consequently, probabilities lean towards stability or a slight decrease in Berkshire's stock price, with limited chances of a rise. Given the mixed sentiment around Apple and its potential impact on Berkshire, I've balanced the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to Big Tech earnings, including Apple, due to competition from companies like DeepSeek. The market's reaction to DeepSeek's announcement (significant pre-market declines in major tech stocks) suggests investor concern. Despite projected earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven', the emergence of a tangible competitor raises concerns about meeting these high expectations. Given Apple's large market capitalization and sensitivity to broader tech sentiment of the 'Magnificent Seven', the news is negative. The other models also see downward trend given this news, despite predicting a rise sometimes given their own information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The broader tech sector is experiencing a downturn fueled by the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model and anticipation of a Fed interest rate hike. This negative market sentiment creates downward pressure on Apple's stock. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a crucial factor. Strong earnings could mitigate the negative market influence, while weak results would likely exacerbate the downward pressure.  The previous predictions are varied, some leaning towards a price fall due to the negative market context and concerns about the competitive AI landscape. Others indicate a higher probability of a rise, based on the strength of Apple's fundamentals and its position in the AI market.  Considering this conflicting information, along with the overall uncertainty, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall due to the immediate negative market sentiment, but a sizable portion of probability remains assigned to a price rise based on the possibility of positive earnings news counteracting the negative market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its potential as a growth driver, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment. Analyst comments suggest that Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, indicating a lack of immediate catalysts. While the company remains a strong player in the tech industry, the news leans slightly negative due to the mentioned challenges and lack of significant growth drivers in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed. This situation is likely short-lived and may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban's uncertainty and the potential for TikTok to be reinstated or sold could influence investor sentiment, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials. However, the frenzy around iPhones with TikTok installed might be perceived as a minor positive for Apple's stock in the short term due to increased demand, but this is not substantial enough to drive significant long-term growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation.

But, given the already high valuation of Apple's stock, the potential for upside may be limited. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. However, the news article's focus on Apple's AI investments and its strong position in the AI landscape suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics, with indirect references to Apple's impending earnings report. While the earnings report could impact Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, the article suggests caution regarding immediate investments in Berkshire. Factors such as the current valuation, recent lack of stock buybacks, and modest analyst predictions contribute to a cautious outlook. Although Apple's performance can influence Berkshire's stock, the probabilities lean more towards stability or a slight decrease due to the mixed signals presented in the news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
