(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple, Meta Platforms rise to lead 'Magnificent 7' stocks amid AI washout\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) stock both jumped more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of their Magnificent Seven peers and providing some respite for tech investors amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names following the release of Chinese firm DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model.\n\nIn an email on Monday, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, \"Apple is reacting positively to the DeepSeek news because smaller more efficient models means it will be able to have better AI products in the iPhone.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year on AI investments. The company has been working on building its own AI model, Llama, and DeepSeek's breakthrough shows possible efficiency gains available to future LLMs.Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nCompanies being hit hardest on Monday, most notably Nvidia, make AI chips that power these models.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek released an AI model competitive with OpenAI\u2019s last week, putting it at the top of Apple\u2019s app store.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote in a post on X Jan. 24 that DeepSeek's latest R1 model is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\" Apple also offers ChatGPT on its latest iPhone.\n\nThe reported cost to train one of its latest models was just $5.6 billion, far below OpenAI\u2019s more than $100 million in spending to train GPT-4 \u2014 prompting concern among the investment community that hyperscalers are severely over investing in AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) led chip stocks down, while the tech heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6%. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) also fell.DeepSeek app on an iPhone.

Apple is set to report earnings after the bell Jan. 30. The majority of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $246 over the next 12 months.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off driven by concerns over AI competition, notably the emergence of DeepSeek, which has affected major players in the tech sector including Apple. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are expected to face pressure due to reduced earnings growth expectations. While Apple has had strong fundamentals, the current market sentiment is cautious, especially with tech stocks being a focal point for investors. Given the broader sell-off in tech and the specific concerns raised, there is a higher likelihood that investors may react negatively in the short term, leading to a probable fall in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its existing AI applications (Siri, on-device ML). JPMorgan acknowledges Apple's significance in the AI landscape, ranking it 6th on their list of important AI stocks for 2025. However, the news also mentions concerns about the valuation discrepancies between tech stocks and the rest of the market. JPMorgan suggests potential opportunities in other AI sectors, cautioning against dependence on mega-cap tech valuations. The article implies that while Apple is making notable efforts in AI, there is uncertainty about the broader AI ecosystem's revenue potential and whether the market expectations are realistic. Also, the article mentions other AI stocks may outperform AAPL. I am weighing the positive aspect of AI investment driving possible stock increases with the caveat from JP Morgan indicating AI investment may not be enough for significant stock price increases.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot that rivals US competitors at a significantly lower cost. This poses a threat to the dominance of US tech companies, including Apple, particularly in the AI sector.  While Apple's direct involvement in AI development is less emphasized in this news compared to companies like Nvidia or Microsoft, the overall negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to DeepSeek's disruptive potential and cost efficiency is likely to affect Apple's stock price indirectly. The broad market sell-off triggered by this news suggests a general risk-off sentiment, impacting even relatively stable tech giants like Apple.  However, Apple's diverse business model and strong brand recognition may cushion it from the full impact of the sell-off. The probability estimates reflect this balance: a significant chance of a price fall due to broader market reaction and negative sentiment, but a non-zero chance of a price rise if the market's reaction is less severe or if other positive news emerges.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple's stock rose by more than 2% on Monday, driven by positive sentiment around the potential for better AI products in the iPhone following DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest that smaller, more efficient AI models could benefit Apple. Additionally, while other tech stocks, especially those in the AI chip sector, faced a sell-off, Apple and Meta bucked the trend. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could also influence the stock price. Overall, the immediate reaction to the news is positive, but broader challenges remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off in major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The sell-off is primarily due to concerns that DeepSeek's ability to match US AI competitors at a lower cost could disrupt the AI industry and negatively impact the valuations of tech giants. Despite this, Apple's stock showed a relatively small decline compared to other tech giants, and it even rose 2.6% on the day. The news may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price in the short term, but the overall sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price fall in the near term due to the sector-wide sell-off.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the recent TikTok ban and its impact on iPhone sales, with some iPhones selling for thousands of dollars on eBay due to the pre-installed TikTok app. However, this situation is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's overall stock price, as the number of iPhones being sold at inflated prices is relatively small compared to Apple's total sales. Additionally, the ban on TikTok is still uncertain and may be resolved in the near future, which could reduce the demand for these iPhones. Nevertheless, the news may still have a slight positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the increased demand for iPhones, even if it's temporary and limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns over the competition posed by DeepSeek in the AI market, triggering a sell-off in major tech stocks, including Apple. While some analysts noted Apple's potential advantages in the AI space, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to fears of slowing earnings growth against a backdrop of high valuations and broader market uncertainties. Given the trends seen in prior predictions and the potential negative sentiment affecting the tech sector, a higher probability of a price fall is anticipated. However, a smaller chance remains for price stability or growth, particularly if Apple's fundamentals or upcoming earnings reports dispel some concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing AI investments and its standing as a key player in the AI landscape, as recognized by JPMorgan, ranking it 6th among important AI stocks for 2025. This positive sentiment is balanced by JPMorgan's caution regarding the high valuations of 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, relative to the rest of the market, and the potential for earnings disappointments to cause volatility. There is a broad concern about whether the earnings expectations assumed for a handful of AI-related companies may be optimistic. Previous predictions reflected both positive and negative sentiments, with fluctuating estimates of price rise and fall probabilities. Considering these factors, including Apple's strong fundamentals and JPMorgan's neutral-to-positive outlook, and the past rounds, I predict a slightly increased likelihood of a price rise, but not a huge one given the cautionary signals from JP Morgan.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the general market sell-off in tech due to DeepSeek's emergence is a significant negative factor, Apple's relatively strong fundamentals and diverse business model offer some insulation.  The fact that Apple's stock actually rose slightly on the day of the news, while other tech giants plummeted, suggests a degree of resilience. However, the long-term implications of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model remain uncertain and could pose a threat to Apple's AI initiatives down the line.  The conflicting signals lead to a prediction leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but not a dramatic one. The probabilities are also influenced by the observed range of previous predictions, indicating a lack of consensus in the market.  The previous predictions range from 0.25 to 0.65 probability of a rise and 0.35 to 0.75 probability of a fall. My prediction incorporates this uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed impact on Apple's stock (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock rose by more than 2% due to optimism around the potential for better AI products in the iPhone following DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest this could benefit Apple. Additionally, Apple and Meta bucked the broader tech sell-off trend. However, negative factors include a 12% decline in Apple's stock from last month due to struggling iPhone sales, recent downgrades, and broader market concerns about AI competition and over-investment in AI infrastructure. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 adds further uncertainty. Considering the immediate positive reaction to the news but the lingering challenges, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off in major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The sell-off is primarily due to concerns that DeepSeek's ability to match US AI competitors at a lower cost could disrupt the AI industry and negatively impact the valuations of tech giants. Despite this, Apple's stock showed a relatively small decline compared to other tech giants, and it even rose 2.6% on the day. The broad market sell-off and negative sentiment towards tech stocks due to DeepSeek's disruptive potential suggest a cautious outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term. However, Apple's diverse business model and strong brand recognition may cushion it from the full impact of the sell-off. The probability estimates reflect this balance: a significant chance of a price fall due to broader market reaction and negative sentiment, but a non-zero chance of a price rise if the market's reaction is less severe or if other positive news emerges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for thousands of dollars on eBay due to the recent TikTok ban in the U.S. may have a slight positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, this situation is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's overall stock price, as the number of iPhones being sold at inflated prices is relatively small compared to Apple's total sales. Additionally, the ban on TikTok is still uncertain and may be resolved in the near future, which could reduce the demand for these iPhones. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which showed a mix of positive and negative sentiments towards Apple's stock price, the current news may not be enough to drastically change the overall market sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are relatively close.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple and Meta Platforms bucking the trend in the tech sector, rising more than 2%. Apple's stock increase is attributed to positive sentiment around improved AI capabilities in the iPhone due to DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. Despite Apple's overall dip in stock price by 12% from last month, it seems to be responding positively to the developments in AI technology. However, there are concerns regarding upcoming earnings reports and some downgrades by analysts. The mixed opinions of the previous round predictions suggest a balanced view considering both positive and negative factors affecting the stock price. Overall, the sentiment leans towards a slight probability of upward movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
