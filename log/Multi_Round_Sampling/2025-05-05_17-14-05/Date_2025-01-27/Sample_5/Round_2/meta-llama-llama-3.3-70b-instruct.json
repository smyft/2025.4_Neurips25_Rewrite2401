(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off driven by concerns over AI competition, notably the emergence of DeepSeek, which has affected major players in the tech sector including Apple. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are expected to face pressure due to reduced earnings growth expectations. While Apple has had strong fundamentals, the current market sentiment is cautious, especially with tech stocks being a focal point for investors. Given the broader sell-off in tech and the specific concerns raised, there is a higher likelihood that investors may react negatively in the short term, leading to a probable fall in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its existing AI applications (Siri, on-device ML). JPMorgan acknowledges Apple's significance in the AI landscape, ranking it 6th on their list of important AI stocks for 2025. However, the news also mentions concerns about the valuation discrepancies between tech stocks and the rest of the market. JPMorgan suggests potential opportunities in other AI sectors, cautioning against dependence on mega-cap tech valuations. The article implies that while Apple is making notable efforts in AI, there is uncertainty about the broader AI ecosystem's revenue potential and whether the market expectations are realistic. Also, the article mentions other AI stocks may outperform AAPL. I am weighing the positive aspect of AI investment driving possible stock increases with the caveat from JP Morgan indicating AI investment may not be enough for significant stock price increases.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot that rivals US competitors at a significantly lower cost. This poses a threat to the dominance of US tech companies, including Apple, particularly in the AI sector.  While Apple's direct involvement in AI development is less emphasized in this news compared to companies like Nvidia or Microsoft, the overall negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to DeepSeek's disruptive potential and cost efficiency is likely to affect Apple's stock price indirectly. The broad market sell-off triggered by this news suggests a general risk-off sentiment, impacting even relatively stable tech giants like Apple.  However, Apple's diverse business model and strong brand recognition may cushion it from the full impact of the sell-off. The probability estimates reflect this balance: a significant chance of a price fall due to broader market reaction and negative sentiment, but a non-zero chance of a price rise if the market's reaction is less severe or if other positive news emerges.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple's stock rose by more than 2% on Monday, driven by positive sentiment around the potential for better AI products in the iPhone following DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest that smaller, more efficient AI models could benefit Apple. Additionally, while other tech stocks, especially those in the AI chip sector, faced a sell-off, Apple and Meta bucked the trend. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could also influence the stock price. Overall, the immediate reaction to the news is positive, but broader challenges remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off in major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The sell-off is primarily due to concerns that DeepSeek's ability to match US AI competitors at a lower cost could disrupt the AI industry and negatively impact the valuations of tech giants. Despite this, Apple's stock showed a relatively small decline compared to other tech giants, and it even rose 2.6% on the day. The news may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price in the short term, but the overall sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price fall in the near term due to the sector-wide sell-off.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the recent TikTok ban and its impact on iPhone sales, with some iPhones selling for thousands of dollars on eBay due to the pre-installed TikTok app. However, this situation is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's overall stock price, as the number of iPhones being sold at inflated prices is relatively small compared to Apple's total sales. Additionally, the ban on TikTok is still uncertain and may be resolved in the near future, which could reduce the demand for these iPhones. Nevertheless, the news may still have a slight positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the increased demand for iPhones, even if it's temporary and limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns over the competition posed by DeepSeek in the AI market, triggering a sell-off in major tech stocks, including Apple. While some analysts noted Apple's potential advantages in the AI space, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to fears of slowing earnings growth against a backdrop of high valuations and broader market uncertainties. Given the trends seen in prior predictions and the potential negative sentiment affecting the tech sector, a higher probability of a price fall is anticipated. However, a smaller chance remains for price stability or growth, particularly if Apple's fundamentals or upcoming earnings reports dispel some concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing AI investments and its standing as a key player in the AI landscape, as recognized by JPMorgan, ranking it 6th among important AI stocks for 2025. This positive sentiment is balanced by JPMorgan's caution regarding the high valuations of 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, relative to the rest of the market, and the potential for earnings disappointments to cause volatility. There is a broad concern about whether the earnings expectations assumed for a handful of AI-related companies may be optimistic. Previous predictions reflected both positive and negative sentiments, with fluctuating estimates of price rise and fall probabilities. Considering these factors, including Apple's strong fundamentals and JPMorgan's neutral-to-positive outlook, and the past rounds, I predict a slightly increased likelihood of a price rise, but not a huge one given the cautionary signals from JP Morgan.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the general market sell-off in tech due to DeepSeek's emergence is a significant negative factor, Apple's relatively strong fundamentals and diverse business model offer some insulation.  The fact that Apple's stock actually rose slightly on the day of the news, while other tech giants plummeted, suggests a degree of resilience. However, the long-term implications of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model remain uncertain and could pose a threat to Apple's AI initiatives down the line.  The conflicting signals lead to a prediction leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but not a dramatic one. The probabilities are also influenced by the observed range of previous predictions, indicating a lack of consensus in the market.  The previous predictions range from 0.25 to 0.65 probability of a rise and 0.35 to 0.75 probability of a fall. My prediction incorporates this uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed impact on Apple's stock (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock rose by more than 2% due to optimism around the potential for better AI products in the iPhone following DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest this could benefit Apple. Additionally, Apple and Meta bucked the broader tech sell-off trend. However, negative factors include a 12% decline in Apple's stock from last month due to struggling iPhone sales, recent downgrades, and broader market concerns about AI competition and over-investment in AI infrastructure. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 adds further uncertainty. Considering the immediate positive reaction to the news but the lingering challenges, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off in major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The sell-off is primarily due to concerns that DeepSeek's ability to match US AI competitors at a lower cost could disrupt the AI industry and negatively impact the valuations of tech giants. Despite this, Apple's stock showed a relatively small decline compared to other tech giants, and it even rose 2.6% on the day. The broad market sell-off and negative sentiment towards tech stocks due to DeepSeek's disruptive potential suggest a cautious outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term. However, Apple's diverse business model and strong brand recognition may cushion it from the full impact of the sell-off. The probability estimates reflect this balance: a significant chance of a price fall due to broader market reaction and negative sentiment, but a non-zero chance of a price rise if the market's reaction is less severe or if other positive news emerges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for thousands of dollars on eBay due to the recent TikTok ban in the U.S. may have a slight positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, this situation is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's overall stock price, as the number of iPhones being sold at inflated prices is relatively small compared to Apple's total sales. Additionally, the ban on TikTok is still uncertain and may be resolved in the near future, which could reduce the demand for these iPhones. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which showed a mix of positive and negative sentiments towards Apple's stock price, the current news may not be enough to drastically change the overall market sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are relatively close.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple and Meta Platforms bucking the trend in the tech sector, rising more than 2%. Apple's stock increase is attributed to positive sentiment around improved AI capabilities in the iPhone due to DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. Despite Apple's overall dip in stock price by 12% from last month, it seems to be responding positively to the developments in AI technology. However, there are concerns regarding upcoming earnings reports and some downgrades by analysts. The mixed opinions of the previous round predictions suggest a balanced view considering both positive and negative factors affecting the stock price. Overall, the sentiment leans towards a slight probability of upward movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
