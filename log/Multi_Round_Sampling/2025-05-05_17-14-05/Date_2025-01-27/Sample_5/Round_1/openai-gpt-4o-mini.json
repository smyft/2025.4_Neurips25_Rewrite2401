(AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market\nNews Content: Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.\n\nNew developments from Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.\n\nNvidia stock was set to open lower by more than 11%. Meanwhile fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off about 5% or more in pre-market trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ES=F)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nA slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With with index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.\n\nBut unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.\n\nIn 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the \"Magnificent Seven\" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.\n\nAs Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 22: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on January 22, 2025 in New York City. Stocks continued an upward swing opening up high a day after the Dow Jones closed up 500 points and the S&P 500 approaching an all-time high. The rise comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison made an announcement alongside President Donald Trump that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. (Photo by Michael M.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off driven by concerns over AI competition, notably the emergence of DeepSeek, which has affected major players in the tech sector including Apple. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are expected to face pressure due to reduced earnings growth expectations. While Apple has had strong fundamentals, the current market sentiment is cautious, especially with tech stocks being a focal point for investors. Given the broader sell-off in tech and the specific concerns raised, there is a higher likelihood that investors may react negatively in the short term, leading to a probable fall in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its existing AI applications (Siri, on-device ML). JPMorgan acknowledges Apple's significance in the AI landscape, ranking it 6th on their list of important AI stocks for 2025. However, the news also mentions concerns about the valuation discrepancies between tech stocks and the rest of the market. JPMorgan suggests potential opportunities in other AI sectors, cautioning against dependence on mega-cap tech valuations. The article implies that while Apple is making notable efforts in AI, there is uncertainty about the broader AI ecosystem's revenue potential and whether the market expectations are realistic. Also, the article mentions other AI stocks may outperform AAPL. I am weighing the positive aspect of AI investment driving possible stock increases with the caveat from JP Morgan indicating AI investment may not be enough for significant stock price increases.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot that rivals US competitors at a significantly lower cost. This poses a threat to the dominance of US tech companies, including Apple, particularly in the AI sector.  While Apple's direct involvement in AI development is less emphasized in this news compared to companies like Nvidia or Microsoft, the overall negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to DeepSeek's disruptive potential and cost efficiency is likely to affect Apple's stock price indirectly. The broad market sell-off triggered by this news suggests a general risk-off sentiment, impacting even relatively stable tech giants like Apple.  However, Apple's diverse business model and strong brand recognition may cushion it from the full impact of the sell-off. The probability estimates reflect this balance: a significant chance of a price fall due to broader market reaction and negative sentiment, but a non-zero chance of a price rise if the market's reaction is less severe or if other positive news emerges.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple's stock rose by more than 2% on Monday, driven by positive sentiment around the potential for better AI products in the iPhone following DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest that smaller, more efficient AI models could benefit Apple. Additionally, while other tech stocks, especially those in the AI chip sector, faced a sell-off, Apple and Meta bucked the trend. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could also influence the stock price. Overall, the immediate reaction to the news is positive, but broader challenges remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off in major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The sell-off is primarily due to concerns that DeepSeek's ability to match US AI competitors at a lower cost could disrupt the AI industry and negatively impact the valuations of tech giants. Despite this, Apple's stock showed a relatively small decline compared to other tech giants, and it even rose 2.6% on the day. The news may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price in the short term, but the overall sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price fall in the near term due to the sector-wide sell-off.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the recent TikTok ban and its impact on iPhone sales, with some iPhones selling for thousands of dollars on eBay due to the pre-installed TikTok app. However, this situation is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's overall stock price, as the number of iPhones being sold at inflated prices is relatively small compared to Apple's total sales. Additionally, the ban on TikTok is still uncertain and may be resolved in the near future, which could reduce the demand for these iPhones. Nevertheless, the news may still have a slight positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the increased demand for iPhones, even if it's temporary and limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
