(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is part of the earnings preview for a significant time period, suggesting potential market interest. However, the company's recent struggles and bearish sentiment, particularly surrounding its performance in the Chinese market and its AI strategy, indicate a greater likelihood of negative stock movement. Analysts project a potential guidance cut, which could further dampen investor confidence. Given these factors, while there may be some hope for recovery, the bearish sentiment outweighs potential positive reactions to the earnings report, leading to a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content clearly indicate negative sentiment towards US tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI. The emergence of a potentially cost-effective competitor from China (Deepseek) creates significant uncertainty and could undermine the valuations of companies heavily invested in AI hardware and software. While some analysts suggest this could be an overreaction or even beneficial for some 'hyperscalers' in the long run, the immediate market response is strongly negative. Apple rose 2.6pc in premarket, likely due to an increase stock to bonds with the rise in demand for safe haven currencies; as well as Apple being the least affected from the Deepseek news. Given the information provided, the fall of Apple stock prices at the end of the week is the more likely situation, with the assumption that Apple stock rose at it did due to the market sell-off to seek stable ground.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's involvement in the AI sector. While the article highlights Apple's struggles in other areas such as the Chinese market, weak performance from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and challenges faced by the Vision Pro and HomePod,  the core argument focuses on skepticism regarding AI being a significant driver for Apple's future growth.  A prominent CIO expresses doubt that AI will be a catalyst for Apple's next level of growth, citing concerns about valuation and  the lack of strong AI-related catalysts.  However, the article acknowledges Apple\u2019s presence in the AI space, and a high number of hedge fund investors are mentioned, which somewhat offsets the negative sentiment.  Considering the overall tone of the piece, the skepticism outweighs the positive aspects. The article also directs readers towards other AI stocks considered more promising, further weakening the positive sentiment around Apple's AI prospects.  Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price fall, reflecting the analyst's doubt about AI's impact on Apple's future and the additional challenges the company is facing.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a long-term holding, despite recent sales of AAPL shares by Berkshire Hathaway. The article emphasizes Apple's strong market position, capital-return program, and consistent buybacks, which have improved EPS. However, the sale of 615 million shares by Berkshire over the past year introduces some uncertainty. Overall, Buffett's continued praise and Apple's fundamentals suggest positive sentiment, but the large-scale selling could temper investor enthusiasm. The net effect is likely moderately positive for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in Apple and how Apple's upcoming quarterly results on January 30 could impact Berkshire's stock price. Historically, there has been a moderate correlation (0.49) between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances. However, past instances where Apple reported great results and its stock soared did not lead to significant increases in Berkshire's stock price. The article concludes that there is no compelling reason to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock specifically before January 30 based on Apple's results. The analysis suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Berkshire Hathaway's stock price movement based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to drive ecosystem growth and innovation. JPMorgan's report suggests that the AI revolution will have a significant impact on the market, and Apple is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. However, the report also notes that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem, which could lead to volatility. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple ranks 6th on the list of important AI stocks for 2025, implying that there may be other stocks with greater potential for returns. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to potential volatility and competition from other AI stocks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones as they contain the banned TikTok application, driving sellers to list these phones at significantly higher prices on eBay. While Apple benefits from increased interest in its products, the news also underscores regulatory uncertainty around popular apps, potentially affecting the broader technology sector environment. Moreover, Apple doesn't directly benefit from reselling used iPhones on eBay. Therefore, there might be a short-term positive impact due to increased sales and visibility of the company\u2019s products, but long-term effects could be mixed.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
