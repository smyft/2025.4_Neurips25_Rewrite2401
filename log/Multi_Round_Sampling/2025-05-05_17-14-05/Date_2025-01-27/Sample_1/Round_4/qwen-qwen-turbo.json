(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is part of the earnings preview for a significant time period, suggesting potential market interest. However, the company's recent struggles and bearish sentiment, particularly surrounding its performance in the Chinese market and its AI strategy, indicate a greater likelihood of negative stock movement. Analysts project a potential guidance cut, which could further dampen investor confidence. Given these factors, while there may be some hope for recovery, the bearish sentiment outweighs potential positive reactions to the earnings report, leading to a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content clearly indicate negative sentiment towards US tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI. The emergence of a potentially cost-effective competitor from China (Deepseek) creates significant uncertainty and could undermine the valuations of companies heavily invested in AI hardware and software. While some analysts suggest this could be an overreaction or even beneficial for some 'hyperscalers' in the long run, the immediate market response is strongly negative. Apple rose 2.6pc in premarket, likely due to an increase stock to bonds with the rise in demand for safe haven currencies; as well as Apple being the least affected from the Deepseek news. Given the information provided, the fall of Apple stock prices at the end of the week is the more likely situation, with the assumption that Apple stock rose at it did due to the market sell-off to seek stable ground.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's involvement in the AI sector. While the article highlights Apple's struggles in other areas such as the Chinese market, weak performance from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and challenges faced by the Vision Pro and HomePod,  the core argument focuses on skepticism regarding AI being a significant driver for Apple's future growth.  A prominent CIO expresses doubt that AI will be a catalyst for Apple's next level of growth, citing concerns about valuation and  the lack of strong AI-related catalysts.  However, the article acknowledges Apple\u2019s presence in the AI space, and a high number of hedge fund investors are mentioned, which somewhat offsets the negative sentiment.  Considering the overall tone of the piece, the skepticism outweighs the positive aspects. The article also directs readers towards other AI stocks considered more promising, further weakening the positive sentiment around Apple's AI prospects.  Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price fall, reflecting the analyst's doubt about AI's impact on Apple's future and the additional challenges the company is facing.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a long-term holding, despite recent sales of AAPL shares by Berkshire Hathaway. The article emphasizes Apple's strong market position, capital-return program, and consistent buybacks, which have improved EPS. However, the sale of 615 million shares by Berkshire over the past year introduces some uncertainty. Overall, Buffett's continued praise and Apple's fundamentals suggest positive sentiment, but the large-scale selling could temper investor enthusiasm. The net effect is likely moderately positive for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in Apple and how Apple's upcoming quarterly results on January 30 could impact Berkshire's stock price. Historically, there has been a moderate correlation (0.49) between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances. However, past instances where Apple reported great results and its stock soared did not lead to significant increases in Berkshire's stock price. The article concludes that there is no compelling reason to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock specifically before January 30 based on Apple's results. The analysis suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Berkshire Hathaway's stock price movement based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to drive ecosystem growth and innovation. JPMorgan's report suggests that the AI revolution will have a significant impact on the market, and Apple is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. However, the report also notes that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem, which could lead to volatility. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple ranks 6th on the list of important AI stocks for 2025, implying that there may be other stocks with greater potential for returns. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to potential volatility and competition from other AI stocks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones as they contain the banned TikTok application, driving sellers to list these phones at significantly higher prices on eBay. While Apple benefits from increased interest in its products, the news also underscores regulatory uncertainty around popular apps, potentially affecting the broader technology sector environment. Moreover, Apple doesn't directly benefit from reselling used iPhones on eBay. Therefore, there might be a short-term positive impact due to increased sales and visibility of the company\u2019s products, but long-term effects could be mixed.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple is part of a group of companies reporting earnings amid a challenging environment, with negative sentiment surrounding its recent stock performance and concerns about guidance cuts. While some analysts believe the bearish sentiment is overdone, the prevailing concerns about Apple's AI strategy and performance in the Chinese market create a more cautious outlook. The probabilities from previous predictions mainly reflect a consensus leaning towards a price decline, with more analysts leaning towards negative expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for tech stocks, particularly those associated with AI. The emergence of DeepSeek as a low-cost, high-performing competitor to US AI companies has triggered a significant sell-off, indicating a loss of investor confidence. Even though Apple itself rose one day, it's likely due to a flight to safety. Apple's AI strategy remains unclear, and the broader market downturn impacting key hardware suppliers casts a negative light on the sector. Given these factors, I believe the probability of AAPL's stock price falling in the longer term is greater than the probability of it rising, although the daily variance is volatile.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the lack of a strong AI narrative and challenges in China and other product segments are significant headwinds, Apple's substantial size and brand loyalty provide a buffer against drastic negative movements.  The analyst's skepticism towards AI as a near-term catalyst is a key negative factor, outweighing the positive aspect of a high number of hedge fund investors. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a price fall.  Considering the overall sentiment, combined with the lack of compelling positive news, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but a significant drop is unlikely given Apple's overall financial health. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the prevailing negative sentiment and challenges faced by the company, but acknowledging the limitations of predicting short-term stock movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL), despite recent sales of AAPL shares by Berkshire Hathaway. The article emphasizes Apple's strong market position, capital-return program, and consistent buybacks, which have improved EPS. However, the sale of 615 million shares by Berkshire over the past year introduces some uncertainty. Overall, Buffett's continued praise and Apple's fundamentals suggest positive sentiment, but the large-scale selling could temper investor enthusiasm. The net effect is likely moderately positive for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on January 30th on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. Historically, there has been a moderate correlation between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances. However, past instances where Apple reported great results did not lead to significant increases in Berkshire's stock price. The article suggests that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire due to its significant holding in Apple, but it does not provide a clear reason for a substantial short-term impact on Berkshire's stock price. Considering the moderate correlation and past reactions, there seems to be a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a positive reaction due to the significance of Apple's earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to drive ecosystem growth and innovation. JPMorgan's report suggests that the AI revolution will have a significant impact on the market, and Apple is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. However, the report also notes that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem, which could lead to volatility. Considering the overall positive sentiment towards Apple's AI investments and its position in the market, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The previous predictions from other models also show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but the majority of them assign a higher probability to the stock price rising or a lower probability to the stock price falling. Therefore, I will assign a probability of 0.6 to the stock price rising and 0.4 to the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns surrounding Apple's recent struggles, particularly regarding its performance in the Chinese market and issues with its AI strategy. With analysts hinting at potential guidance cuts and a generally bearish sentiment prevailing in the tech sector, particularly for companies engaged with AI, there is a strong belief that these challenges will negatively affect Apple's stock price. Although there are some bullish sentiments due to the potential in AI and strong brand loyalty, the prevailing uncertainty seems to outweigh these factors, leading to an overall higher probability of a stock price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for tech stocks, particularly those associated with AI. The emergence of DeepSeek as a low-cost, high-performing competitor to US AI companies has triggered a significant sell-off, indicating a loss of investor confidence. This has lead to panic selling of those companies associated with AI. Although Apple has not been the focus of AI development, there has been significant emphasis by the market that there should be an AI component integrated into Apple products. Given this news, there is a higher chance that general selloff pressures will drive Apple even further down. I estimate a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise. The trend among the other models also appears to lean towards that negative sell pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the headline and several analysts express skepticism about AI driving significant near-term growth for Apple,  the company's strong fundamentals and large market cap provide a degree of insulation against major negative impacts.  Concerns about the Chinese market and underperformance of certain product lines are legitimate headwinds but do not necessarily guarantee a stock price decline.  The previous predictions from various models show wide divergence in opinion, further highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's short-term trajectory. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the news leans slightly negative,  weighted by the analyst's direct skepticism of AI as a near-term catalyst and Apple's challenges in key markets. Also, the emergence of low-cost Chinese AI competitors introduces additional market uncertainty. Considering the lack of strong positive catalysts and the presence of substantial headwinds, a slight preference for a price fall is assigned.  However, a major drop is considered unlikely given Apple's overall financial health and brand strength. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc.

Historically, there has been a moderate correlation (0.49) between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances. However, past instances where Apple reported great results did not lead to significant increases in Berkshire's stock price. The article suggests that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire due to its significant holding in Apple, but it does not provide a clear reason for a substantial short-term impact on Berkshire's stock price. Considering the moderate correlation and past reactions, there seems to be a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a positive reaction due to the significance of Apple's earnings report. However, given the mixed sentiments and the fact that Berkshire's stock price movements are influenced by various factors beyond just Apple's performance, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to drive ecosystem growth and innovation. JPMorgan's report suggests that the AI revolution will have a significant impact on the market, and Apple is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. However, the report also notes that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem, which could lead to volatility.

Analysts express skepticism on Apple's ability to deliver positive earnings surprises, with potential guidance cuts looming. Despite some bullish views regarding future AI partnerships and Apple's strong fundamentals, the prevailing sentiment is cautious, suggesting a greater likelihood of a stock price decline. The consensus among prior predictions leans toward negative movement, thus, a higher probability of a price fall is assessed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.33, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.67, Reasoning: The dominant narrative in the provided news revolves around the negative impact of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot on US tech stocks, including Apple. While Apple itself rose at one point, it's likely due to a flight to safety with investors seeking stable havens. The broader context emphasizes market turmoil and a significant sell-off in AI related firms, triggered by concerns about US dominance and the efficient cost of Chinese competitor. Multiple articles directly states that this new player in the AI market will negatively impact the revenue and projections already forecasted. Also, the current trend shows a rise in probability of the stock falling. Given this strong negative sentiment and the previous predictions leaning towards a price decline, the higher likelihood is that the stock price will fall. However, Apple's overall financial strength and brand recognition may limit the extent of the fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the core news piece focuses on skepticism regarding AI as a major growth driver for Apple in the near term, citing concerns from a Chief Investment Officer and highlighting Apple's struggles in China and with newer product lines, there are counterpoints. Apple maintains a strong brand and a large market share. The high number of hedge fund investors suggests ongoing interest.  However, the overall tone is bearish, particularly in light of the rise of cost-effective Chinese AI competitors. The previous predictions show a trend toward a higher probability of a price fall, with the majority leaning towards a negative outlook.  While Apple's fundamentals and brand strength provide some resilience, the concerning news around AI competitiveness, Chinese market performance, and lack of compelling new catalysts suggest a greater probability of a price decline in the near term. The long-term outlook remains uncertain,  depending on how Apple executes its strategy going forward, but the immediate reaction is more likely to be negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc.
