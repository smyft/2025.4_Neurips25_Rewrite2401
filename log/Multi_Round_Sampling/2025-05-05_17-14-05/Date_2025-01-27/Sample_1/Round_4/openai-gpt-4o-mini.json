(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is part of the earnings preview for a significant time period, suggesting potential market interest. However, the company's recent struggles and bearish sentiment, particularly surrounding its performance in the Chinese market and its AI strategy, indicate a greater likelihood of negative stock movement. Analysts project a potential guidance cut, which could further dampen investor confidence. Given these factors, while there may be some hope for recovery, the bearish sentiment outweighs potential positive reactions to the earnings report, leading to a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content clearly indicate negative sentiment towards US tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI. The emergence of a potentially cost-effective competitor from China (Deepseek) creates significant uncertainty and could undermine the valuations of companies heavily invested in AI hardware and software. While some analysts suggest this could be an overreaction or even beneficial for some 'hyperscalers' in the long run, the immediate market response is strongly negative. Apple rose 2.6pc in premarket, likely due to an increase stock to bonds with the rise in demand for safe haven currencies; as well as Apple being the least affected from the Deepseek news. Given the information provided, the fall of Apple stock prices at the end of the week is the more likely situation, with the assumption that Apple stock rose at it did due to the market sell-off to seek stable ground.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's involvement in the AI sector. While the article highlights Apple's struggles in other areas such as the Chinese market, weak performance from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and challenges faced by the Vision Pro and HomePod,  the core argument focuses on skepticism regarding AI being a significant driver for Apple's future growth.  A prominent CIO expresses doubt that AI will be a catalyst for Apple's next level of growth, citing concerns about valuation and  the lack of strong AI-related catalysts.  However, the article acknowledges Apple\u2019s presence in the AI space, and a high number of hedge fund investors are mentioned, which somewhat offsets the negative sentiment.  Considering the overall tone of the piece, the skepticism outweighs the positive aspects. The article also directs readers towards other AI stocks considered more promising, further weakening the positive sentiment around Apple's AI prospects.  Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price fall, reflecting the analyst's doubt about AI's impact on Apple's future and the additional challenges the company is facing.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a long-term holding, despite recent sales of AAPL shares by Berkshire Hathaway. The article emphasizes Apple's strong market position, capital-return program, and consistent buybacks, which have improved EPS. However, the sale of 615 million shares by Berkshire over the past year introduces some uncertainty. Overall, Buffett's continued praise and Apple's fundamentals suggest positive sentiment, but the large-scale selling could temper investor enthusiasm. The net effect is likely moderately positive for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in Apple and how Apple's upcoming quarterly results on January 30 could impact Berkshire's stock price. Historically, there has been a moderate correlation (0.49) between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances. However, past instances where Apple reported great results and its stock soared did not lead to significant increases in Berkshire's stock price. The article concludes that there is no compelling reason to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock specifically before January 30 based on Apple's results. The analysis suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Berkshire Hathaway's stock price movement based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to drive ecosystem growth and innovation. JPMorgan's report suggests that the AI revolution will have a significant impact on the market, and Apple is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. However, the report also notes that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem, which could lead to volatility. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple ranks 6th on the list of important AI stocks for 2025, implying that there may be other stocks with greater potential for returns. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to potential volatility and competition from other AI stocks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones as they contain the banned TikTok application, driving sellers to list these phones at significantly higher prices on eBay. While Apple benefits from increased interest in its products, the news also underscores regulatory uncertainty around popular apps, potentially affecting the broader technology sector environment. Moreover, Apple doesn't directly benefit from reselling used iPhones on eBay. Therefore, there might be a short-term positive impact due to increased sales and visibility of the company\u2019s products, but long-term effects could be mixed.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple is part of a group of companies reporting earnings amid a challenging environment, with negative sentiment surrounding its recent stock performance and concerns about guidance cuts. While some analysts believe the bearish sentiment is overdone, the prevailing concerns about Apple's AI strategy and performance in the Chinese market create a more cautious outlook. The probabilities from previous predictions mainly reflect a consensus leaning towards a price decline, with more analysts leaning towards negative expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for tech stocks, particularly those associated with AI. The emergence of DeepSeek as a low-cost, high-performing competitor to US AI companies has triggered a significant sell-off, indicating a loss of investor confidence. Even though Apple itself rose one day, it's likely due to a flight to safety. Apple's AI strategy remains unclear, and the broader market downturn impacting key hardware suppliers casts a negative light on the sector. Given these factors, I believe the probability of AAPL's stock price falling in the longer term is greater than the probability of it rising, although the daily variance is volatile.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the lack of a strong AI narrative and challenges in China and other product segments are significant headwinds, Apple's substantial size and brand loyalty provide a buffer against drastic negative movements.  The analyst's skepticism towards AI as a near-term catalyst is a key negative factor, outweighing the positive aspect of a high number of hedge fund investors. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a price fall.  Considering the overall sentiment, combined with the lack of compelling positive news, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but a significant drop is unlikely given Apple's overall financial health. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the prevailing negative sentiment and challenges faced by the company, but acknowledging the limitations of predicting short-term stock movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL), despite recent sales of AAPL shares by Berkshire Hathaway. The article emphasizes Apple's strong market position, capital-return program, and consistent buybacks, which have improved EPS. However, the sale of 615 million shares by Berkshire over the past year introduces some uncertainty. Overall, Buffett's continued praise and Apple's fundamentals suggest positive sentiment, but the large-scale selling could temper investor enthusiasm. The net effect is likely moderately positive for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on January 30th on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. Historically, there has been a moderate correlation between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances. However, past instances where Apple reported great results did not lead to significant increases in Berkshire's stock price. The article suggests that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire due to its significant holding in Apple, but it does not provide a clear reason for a substantial short-term impact on Berkshire's stock price. Considering the moderate correlation and past reactions, there seems to be a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a positive reaction due to the significance of Apple's earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to drive ecosystem growth and innovation. JPMorgan's report suggests that the AI revolution will have a significant impact on the market, and Apple is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. However, the report also notes that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem, which could lead to volatility. Considering the overall positive sentiment towards Apple's AI investments and its position in the market, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The previous predictions from other models also show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but the majority of them assign a higher probability to the stock price rising or a lower probability to the stock price falling. Therefore, I will assign a probability of 0.6 to the stock price rising and 0.4 to the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns surrounding Apple's recent struggles, particularly regarding its performance in the Chinese market and issues with its AI strategy. With analysts hinting at potential guidance cuts and a generally bearish sentiment prevailing in the tech sector, particularly for companies engaged with AI, there is a strong belief that these challenges will negatively affect Apple's stock price. Although there are some bullish sentiments due to the potential in AI and strong brand loyalty, the prevailing uncertainty seems to outweigh these factors, leading to an overall higher probability of a stock price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for tech stocks, particularly those associated with AI. The emergence of DeepSeek as a low-cost, high-performing competitor to US AI companies has triggered a significant sell-off, indicating a loss of investor confidence. This has lead to panic selling of those companies associated with AI. Although Apple has not been the focus of AI development, there has been significant emphasis by the market that there should be an AI component integrated into Apple products. Given this news, there is a higher chance that general selloff pressures will drive Apple even further down. I estimate a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise. The trend among the other models also appears to lean towards that negative sell pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the headline and several analysts express skepticism about AI driving significant near-term growth for Apple,  the company's strong fundamentals and large market cap provide a degree of insulation against major negative impacts.  Concerns about the Chinese market and underperformance of certain product lines are legitimate headwinds but do not necessarily guarantee a stock price decline.  The previous predictions from various models show wide divergence in opinion, further highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's short-term trajectory. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the news leans slightly negative,  weighted by the analyst's direct skepticism of AI as a near-term catalyst and Apple's challenges in key markets. Also, the emergence of low-cost Chinese AI competitors introduces additional market uncertainty. Considering the lack of strong positive catalysts and the presence of substantial headwinds, a slight preference for a price fall is assigned.  However, a major drop is considered unlikely given Apple's overall financial health and brand strength. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL), despite recent sales of AAPL shares by Berkshire Hathaway. The article emphasizes Apple's strong market position, capital-return program, and consistent buybacks, which have improved EPS. However, the sale of 615 million shares by Berkshire over the past year introduces some uncertainty.

The net effect is likely moderately positive for AAPL's stock price. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but the majority assign a higher probability to the stock price rising or a lower probability to the stock price falling. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on January 30th on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Historically, there has been a moderate correlation (0.49) between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances. However, past instances where Apple reported great results did not lead to significant increases in Berkshire's stock price. The article suggests that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire due to its significant holding in Apple, but it does not provide a clear reason for a substantial short-term impact on Berkshire's stock price. Considering the moderate correlation and past reactions, there seems to be a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a positive reaction due to the significance of Apple's earnings report. However, given the mixed sentiments and the fact that Berkshire's stock price movements are influenced by various factors beyond just Apple's performance, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to drive ecosystem growth and innovation. JPMorgan's report suggests that the AI revolution will have a significant impact on the market, and Apple is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. However, the report also notes that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem, which could lead to volatility. Considering the overall positive sentiment towards Apple's AI investments and its position in the market, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The previous predictions from other models also show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but the majority of them assign a higher probability to the stock price rising or a lower probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones as they contain the banned TikTok application, driving sellers to list these phones at significantly higher prices on eBay.

Additionally, previous predictions mostly lean towards a stock price decline, influenced by concerns about Apple's performance in the Chinese market and its AI strategy.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news highlights ongoing negative sentiment regarding Apple, particularly around its struggles in the Chinese market and concerns about its AI strategy. Analysts express skepticism on Apple's ability to deliver positive earnings surprises, with potential guidance cuts looming. Despite some bullish views regarding future AI partnerships and Apple's strong fundamentals, the prevailing sentiment is cautious, suggesting a greater likelihood of a stock price decline. The consensus among prior predictions leans toward negative movement, thus, a higher probability of a price fall is assessed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.33, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.67, Reasoning: The dominant narrative in the provided news revolves around the negative impact of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot on US tech stocks, including Apple. While Apple itself rose at one point, it's likely due to a flight to safety with investors seeking stable havens. The broader context emphasizes market turmoil and a significant sell-off in AI related firms, triggered by concerns about US dominance and the efficient cost of Chinese competitor. Multiple articles directly states that this new player in the AI market will negatively impact the revenue and projections already forecasted. Also, the current trend shows a rise in probability of the stock falling. Given this strong negative sentiment and the previous predictions leaning towards a price decline, the higher likelihood is that the stock price will fall. However, Apple's overall financial strength and brand recognition may limit the extent of the fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the core news piece focuses on skepticism regarding AI as a major growth driver for Apple in the near term, citing concerns from a Chief Investment Officer and highlighting Apple's struggles in China and with newer product lines, there are counterpoints. Apple maintains a strong brand and a large market share. The high number of hedge fund investors suggests ongoing interest.  However, the overall tone is bearish, particularly in light of the rise of cost-effective Chinese AI competitors. The previous predictions show a trend toward a higher probability of a price fall, with the majority leaning towards a negative outlook.  While Apple's fundamentals and brand strength provide some resilience, the concerning news around AI competitiveness, Chinese market performance, and lack of compelling new catalysts suggest a greater probability of a price decline in the near term. The long-term outlook remains uncertain,  depending on how Apple executes its strategy going forward, but the immediate reaction is more likely to be negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong market position, capital-return program, and consistent buybacks, which have improved EPS.

Considering these factors, the net effect is likely moderately positive for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on January 30th on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Historically, there has been a moderate correlation (0.49) between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances.

Considering the moderate correlation and past reactions, there seems to be a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a positive reaction due to the significance of Apple's earnings report. Additionally, previous predictions from various models show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but there is a general inclination towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to drive ecosystem growth and innovation.
