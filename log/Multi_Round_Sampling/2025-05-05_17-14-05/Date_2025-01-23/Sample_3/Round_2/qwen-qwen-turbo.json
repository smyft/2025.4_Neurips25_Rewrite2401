(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Oracle Takes Run at Cloud\u2019s Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens. It\u2019s Now a $200 Million Fiasco Giant Batteries Are Transforming the World\u2019s Electrical Grids\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's developments in the cloud computing space and its joint venture with SoftBank and OpenAI, which may indicate a shift in competitive dynamics among major tech companies, including Apple. In contrast, Apple's stock has experienced a significant decline in January, driven by weak iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts. Given the negative momentum surrounding Apple and the potential competitive pressures from Oracle's expansion, it is likely that investor sentiment for Apple may remain cautious. The overall market sentiment leans more towards a bearish outlook for AAPL given the current struggles and performance metrics. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While highlighting its current market capitalization lead and strong margins, it emphasizes significant headwinds: slowing growth due to a saturated smartphone market, challenges in China with Apple Intelligence integration, and an antitrust lawsuit. The comparison with Nvidia paints a bearish picture for Apple. Nvidia's higher gross profit margins, significantly stronger revenue and EPS growth, and a robust demand outlook for its GPUs driven by the AI boom suggest that Nvidia is better positioned for future growth. The mention of the iPhone's struggle in the last quarter of 2024 indicates potentially weaker sales figures. The Motley Fool's disclaimer about not recommending Nvidia currently is a slight counter-argument to a straight rise in NVDA price, but the overall tone implies a greater likelihood of Apple's stock underperforming relative to NVDA, hence, an increased chance of a fall for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the strong relationship between Tim Cook and President Trump could lead to continued avoidance of tariffs (positive for Apple), Trump's stance on the CHIPS Act introduces uncertainty.  A potential weakening of the CHIPS Act could negatively impact Apple's supply chain and increase production costs.  Additionally, the impact of Trump's policies on AI regulation and potential shifts in the competitive landscape with the rise of a new AI data center company are uncertain.  While AI revenue is expected to be a major focus, the overall impact on Apple's performance remains unclear given the previous instances of mixed investor reaction to other tech companies' AI announcements. The potential benefit from TikTok's possible ban is indirect and uncertain, contingent on Trump's actions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from Greenlight Capital about the overall market valuation, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The letter mentions that Apple's data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent negative performance. The commentary suggests potential downside risk due to high valuations and disappointing data. However, Apple's long-term performance and market position may provide some support. Given the negative tone of the news and recent performance, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple and other smartphone makers, including Google, are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This could potentially lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of Apple's business practices in India, which might negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability in the region. However, it's worth noting that the impact of this pressure is uncertain and might not necessarily lead to a significant decline in Apple's stock price. On the other hand, if Apple is able to adapt to these new requirements and maintain its market share in India, the stock price might not be significantly affected. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook for the company, Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains. This kind of headline typically indicates optimism and confidence in the company's future performance, which could attract more investors and potentially drive up the stock price. However, without specific details about the company's current financials, products, or market conditions, the impact is speculative. Generally, such positive news stories can contribute to a bullish sentiment around a stock, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The latest news highlights Oracle's advancements and potential growth through a joint venture aimed at bolstering its cloud business, which could intensify competition in the tech space, particularly with Apple as it is also a significant player in the tech ecosystem. Apple's stock has recently faced downward pressure due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, leading to concerns about its growth prospects. The developments at Oracle, which show aggressive investment in AI and cloud infrastructure, may create a more competitive environment, resulting in further negative sentiment towards Apple. Given these factors, along with analysts' cautious outlook on Apple's current performance, I estimate a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a compelling case for Nvidia potentially surpassing Apple in market capitalization in 2025. Nvidia's superior gross profit margins, significantly higher revenue and EPS growth, and strong demand driven by the AI boom are significant positive factors. Furthermore, Apple faces headwinds, including slowing iPhone growth, challenges in China, and an antitrust lawsuit in the US, all of which contribute to a weakened outlook compared to Nvidia. While past predictions displayed a bearish sentiment towards Apple, the current news focuses on a direct comparison with a rapidly growing competitor, reinforcing the prediction of a higher chance of a stock price decrease for Apple. \n\nConsidering both the specific analysis and previous predictions that correctly highlighted the potential downward pressure on Apple's stock, the probability of a fall is significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The positive aspects include Tim Cook's strong relationship with President Trump, potentially leading to continued tariff avoidance.  Also, less antitrust regulation could benefit Apple.  However, significant uncertainties exist. Trump's stance on the CHIPS Act is a major concern, potentially impacting Apple's supply chain and costs.  The impact of Trump's broader AI policies and the emergence of a major new AI data center competitor are unclear. While AI revenue will be a focus, past reactions to similar announcements have been mixed. The potential benefit from a TikTok ban is indirect and uncertain.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.25 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the significant uncertainties introduced by the Trump administration's policies, a neutral to slightly negative outlook seems most appropriate.  The overall uncertainty outweighs any potential positives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from Greenlight Capital about Apple Inc. (AAPL), describing the stock as 'pretty expensive' and mentioning disappointing data. Additionally, Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent negative performance. The overall sentiment from Greenlight Capital is cautious, with concerns about market valuation and Apple's performance. Given the negative tone and recent decline, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple, along with Google and other smartphone makers, is facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This regulatory pressure could potentially impact Apple's business operations and revenue in India. However, considering Apple's strong market position and adaptability, the impact might be limited. The mixed predictions from previous models reflect varying perspectives on Apple's stock performance, with some indicating a higher likelihood of a stock price fall due to competitive pressures and regulatory scrutiny, while others suggest a potential for stability or rise based on the company's overall strength and market sentiment. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative implications, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains. This kind of headline typically indicates optimism and confidence in the company's future performance, which could attract more investors and potentially drive up the stock price. Additionally, considering the varied predictions from other models, some of which leaned towards a bearish outlook due to competitive pressures, market valuation concerns, and recent performance issues, the overall trend seems to indicate a cautious stance towards Apple's stock. However, the headline's positive tone and potential for attracting investors could offset some of the negative sentiments. Therefore, estimating a slight edge towards a positive movement seems reasonable, yet keeping in mind the balance of various factors affecting the stock's performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Oracle's efforts in the cloud computing sector and its joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to expand its data centers. While this news is expected to boost investor confidence in Oracle, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the news indirectly impacts Apple due to the competitive dynamics in the cloud computing market. Analysts' opinions are mixed, with some remaining cautious due to Apple's historical performance and current market conditions, particularly weak iPhone sales and downgrades from analysts. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising appears lower based on the current context.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
