This could potentially lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of Apple's business practices in India, which might negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability in the region. However, it's worth noting that the impact of this pressure is uncertain and might not necessarily lead to a significant decline in Apple's stock price. On the other hand, if Apple is able to adapt to these new requirements and maintain its market share in India, the stock price might not be significantly affected. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Market Chatter: Apple, Google, Smartphone Makers Pressed by India to Open Up App Stores\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments!"
