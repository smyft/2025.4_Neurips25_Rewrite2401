(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors\nNews Content: Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025.

The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's developments in the cloud computing space and its joint venture with SoftBank and OpenAI, which may indicate a shift in competitive dynamics among major tech companies, including Apple. In contrast, Apple's stock has experienced a significant decline in January, driven by weak iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts. Given the negative momentum surrounding Apple and the potential competitive pressures from Oracle's expansion, it is likely that investor sentiment for Apple may remain cautious. The overall market sentiment leans more towards a bearish outlook for AAPL given the current struggles and performance metrics. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While highlighting its current market capitalization lead and strong margins, it emphasizes significant headwinds: slowing growth due to a saturated smartphone market, challenges in China with Apple Intelligence integration, and an antitrust lawsuit. The comparison with Nvidia paints a bearish picture for Apple. Nvidia's higher gross profit margins, significantly stronger revenue and EPS growth, and a robust demand outlook for its GPUs driven by the AI boom suggest that Nvidia is better positioned for future growth. The mention of the iPhone's struggle in the last quarter of 2024 indicates potentially weaker sales figures. The Motley Fool's disclaimer about not recommending Nvidia currently is a slight counter-argument to a straight rise in NVDA price, but the overall tone implies a greater likelihood of Apple's stock underperforming relative to NVDA, hence, an increased chance of a fall for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the strong relationship between Tim Cook and President Trump could lead to continued avoidance of tariffs (positive for Apple), Trump's stance on the CHIPS Act introduces uncertainty.  A potential weakening of the CHIPS Act could negatively impact Apple's supply chain and increase production costs.  Additionally, the impact of Trump's policies on AI regulation and potential shifts in the competitive landscape with the rise of a new AI data center company are uncertain.  While AI revenue is expected to be a major focus, the overall impact on Apple's performance remains unclear given the previous instances of mixed investor reaction to other tech companies' AI announcements. The potential benefit from TikTok's possible ban is indirect and uncertain, contingent on Trump's actions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from Greenlight Capital about the overall market valuation, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The letter mentions that Apple's data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent negative performance. The commentary suggests potential downside risk due to high valuations and disappointing data. However, Apple's long-term performance and market position may provide some support. Given the negative tone of the news and recent performance, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple and other smartphone makers, including Google, are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This could potentially lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of Apple's business practices in India, which might negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability in the region. However, it's worth noting that the impact of this pressure is uncertain and might not necessarily lead to a significant decline in Apple's stock price. On the other hand, if Apple is able to adapt to these new requirements and maintain its market share in India, the stock price might not be significantly affected. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook for the company, Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains. This kind of headline typically indicates optimism and confidence in the company's future performance, which could attract more investors and potentially drive up the stock price. However, without specific details about the company's current financials, products, or market conditions, the impact is speculative. Generally, such positive news stories can contribute to a bullish sentiment around a stock, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
