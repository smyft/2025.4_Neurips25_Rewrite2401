A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's developments in the cloud computing space and its joint venture with SoftBank and OpenAI, which may indicate a shift in competitive dynamics among major tech companies, including Apple. In contrast, Apple's stock has experienced a significant decline in January, driven by weak iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts. Given the negative momentum surrounding Apple and the potential competitive pressures from Oracle's expansion, it is likely that investor sentiment for Apple may remain cautious. The overall market sentiment leans more towards a bearish outlook for AAPL given the current struggles and performance metrics. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While highlighting its current market capitalization lead and strong margins, it emphasizes significant headwinds: slowing growth due to a saturated smartphone market, challenges in China with Apple Intelligence integration, and an antitrust lawsuit. The comparison with Nvidia paints a bearish picture for Apple. Nvidia's higher gross profit margins, significantly stronger revenue and EPS growth, and a robust demand outlook for its GPUs driven by the AI boom suggest that Nvidia is better positioned for future growth. The mention of the iPhone's struggle in the last quarter of 2024 indicates potentially weaker sales figures. The Motley Fool's disclaimer about not recommending Nvidia currently is a slight counter-argument to a straight rise in NVDA price, but the overall tone implies a greater likelihood of Apple's stock underperforming relative to NVDA, hence, an increased chance of a fall for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the strong relationship between Tim Cook and President Trump could lead to continued avoidance of tariffs (positive for Apple), Trump's stance on the CHIPS Act introduces uncertainty.  A potential weakening of the CHIPS Act could negatively impact Apple's supply chain and increase production costs.  Additionally, the impact of Trump's policies on AI regulation and potential shifts in the competitive landscape with the rise of a new AI data center company are uncertain.  While AI revenue is expected to be a major focus, the overall impact on Apple's performance remains unclear given the previous instances of mixed investor reaction to other tech companies' AI announcements. The potential benefit from TikTok's possible ban is indirect and uncertain, contingent on Trump's actions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from Greenlight Capital about the overall market valuation, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The letter mentions that Apple's data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent negative performance. The commentary suggests potential downside risk due to high valuations and disappointing data. However, Apple's long-term performance and market position may provide some support. Given the negative tone of the news and recent performance, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple and other smartphone makers, including Google, are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This could potentially lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of Apple's business practices in India, which might negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability in the region. However, it's worth noting that the impact of this pressure is uncertain and might not necessarily lead to a significant decline in Apple's stock price. On the other hand, if Apple is able to adapt to these new requirements and maintain its market share in India, the stock price might not be significantly affected. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook for the company, Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains. This kind of headline typically indicates optimism and confidence in the company's future performance, which could attract more investors and potentially drive up the stock price. However, without specific details about the company's current financials, products, or market conditions, the impact is speculative. Generally, such positive news stories can contribute to a bullish sentiment around a stock, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
