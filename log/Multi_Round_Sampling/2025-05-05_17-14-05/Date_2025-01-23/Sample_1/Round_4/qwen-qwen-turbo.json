(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news suggests that Jim Cramer believes Apple Inc. will miss upcoming earnings due to declining demand, particularly from China, and has doubts about the effectiveness of AI in boosting growth. Cramer's perspective is influential, and particularly his pessimism regarding earnings could weigh heavily on investor sentiment. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's current market capitalization leadership and strong margins, it highlights significant headwinds: performance issues in China due to regulatory obstacles regarding Apple Intelligence, and an antitrust suit in the US. The article directly contrasts Apple's relatively slower revenue and earnings growth with Nvidia's explosive growth fueled by the AI boom. Nvidia's superior gross profit margin and stronger forward-looking statements for AI infrastructure spending give a definite edge to Nvidia. Although the article acknowledges the cyclical factors Nvidia might experience, the consensus and thrust of the details seem to favor Nvidia outpacing Apple. The probability of a rise or fall for Apple's stock is further impacted because of the uncertainty in the chinese market where Apple may not be able to provide Apple Intelligence. Also, the regulatory pressures put on Apple by the US Justice department has created doubts in the minds of investors. All this points to potential downsides to Apple's stock price. However, it is worth considering the advertisement at the end of the document where there is some mention of Nvidia not being best placed for investors to buy. Overall, I feel pressure on Apple's stock over this development more than Nvidia.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new Galaxy S25, leveraging Google AI and Qualcomm technology to compete with Apple's iPhone. While this highlights Samsung's efforts to improve its competitiveness, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news doesn't directly threaten Apple's market position or financial performance. The article mentions Apple's iPhone 17 Air, emphasizing its own AI features and suggesting continued strength in the premium market.  Furthermore, the price action of Qualcomm (a competitor mentioned in relation to the news) shows a slight negative movement pre-market, suggesting limited market excitement surrounding this development, potentially indicating that the news is considered less impactful by the market. Therefore, the probability of a stock price change for AAPL due to this news is low, with a slightly higher probability of no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, this should not concern investors. This implies that the market may not react negatively to the perceived lack of innovation, as other factors (e.g., strong financials, brand loyalty, ecosystem) could outweigh this concern. Historically, Apple's stock has been resilient to criticism about innovation due to its consistent performance and revenue streams. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, as the news does not present a material negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other smartphone makers, including Google, are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This development could potentially impact Apple's business model and revenue streams related to the Indian market. Given that India is a significant and growing market for smartphones, any regulatory changes could have substantial implications. However, the exact impact is uncertain and depends on the specifics of how these changes are implemented. Historically, regulatory pressures can lead to short-term negative stock reactions if investors perceive the changes as threatening to the company's profitability or competitive position. Therefore, there is a possibility of a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price. However, Apple's strong market position and adaptability could mitigate long-term effects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, suggesting that other stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Overall, the news is mildly positive for Apple, but not extremely bullish. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the news doesn't directly impact the immediate performance metrics of Apple Inc but reflects a longer-term strategic and regulatory battle.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple Inc. suggests significant concerns about the company's upcoming earnings, particularly citing declining orders from China and skepticism about the effectiveness of AI innovations. Cramer's influence in financial markets typically correlates with stock price movements, and his negative sentiment indicates a higher likelihood of a price decline. Previous predictions have also leaned towards a bearish outlook despite some acknowledging Apple's strong fundamentals. The market's reaction may be more cautious given the prevailing doubts about Apple's performance and external pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a comprehensive analysis suggesting Nvidia has a strong chance of surpassing Apple in market capitalization in 2025. Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth, driven by the booming AI market, significantly outpace Apple's. Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory challenges in the US, impacting its growth potential. While Apple maintains a higher overall gross profit, Nvidia's superior gross profit margin and sales momentum point to a more favorable outlook. The previous rounds indicate mixed sentiment, but tending towards a more negative outlook for Apple, which aligns with the current news content. Factoring in these considerations, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's competitive efforts using Google AI and Qualcomm technology in its Galaxy S25. While this presents a challenge to Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term. The news doesn't directly threaten Apple's core market position or immediately impact its financial performance, which remains strong based on previous analysis.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the consensus leans towards a slight probability of a price decrease, primarily due to the uncertainties highlighted in previous news articles. However, this specific news concerning Samsung's new phone launch is not inherently negative for Apple and is more likely to cause a neutral to slightly positive market reaction.\n\nThe slightly negative pre-market movement for Qualcomm (a key player in the Samsung phone's technology) further supports the idea that the market is not viewing this as a significant threat to Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting a mostly neutral market response to this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, this should not concern investors, implying that other factors like strong financials and brand loyalty may outweigh concerns about innovation. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models (e.g., deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) leaning towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's resilience and financial health. Others (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-4-scout) highlight potential downsides like regulatory pressures or lack of innovation. Given Apple's historical performance and the mixed sentiment in the market, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google, and other smartphone makers are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This regulatory pressure could potentially impact Apple's business model and revenue streams related to the Indian market. Given that India is a significant and growing market for smartphones, any regulatory changes could have substantial implications. Historically, regulatory pressures can lead to short-term negative stock reactions if investors perceive the changes as threatening to the company's profitability or competitive position. However, Apple's strong market position and adaptability could mitigate long-term effects. Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, with some indicating a higher probability of a stock price fall due to regulatory concerns and others suggesting a more resilient stock performance due to Apple's strong fundamentals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling and a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, suggesting that other stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Given this information and considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions on the potential impact of various news stories on Apple's stock price, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The fact that a prominent investor like Dan Loeb has Apple in his portfolio is a positive signal, but the ranking and the mention of other potentially more promising stocks temper this positivity.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the news doesn't directly impact the immediate performance metrics of Apple Inc but reflects a longer-term strategic and regulatory battle. The mix of previous predictions ranges from very bullish (0.6 rise) to very bearish (0.75 fall). Considering the mixed signals and the regulatory uncertainties, the current scenario seems moderately bearish for Apple's stock.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: Jim Cramer expressed strong concerns about Apple Inc.'s upcoming earnings, specifically highlighting the significant drop in orders from China and doubts over the effectiveness of AI innovations. His commentary often influences investor sentiment, leading to a bearish outlook for Apple's stock price. Previous predictions suggest a heavier inclination towards a price decline due to additional regulatory pressures and competitive challenges from other firms, such as Nvidia, which may further weigh on Apple's market position. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of the stock price falling and a correspondingly low probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The article directly compares Apple and Nvidia, suggesting Nvidia could unseat Apple as the largest company. It highlights Nvidia's strong growth in AI, superior gross profit margins, and positive revenue momentum. Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressure in the US. The previous rounds of predictions show an increasing negative sentiment towards Apple. While some models in Round 0 were more balanced, Round 1 demonstrates a shift towards greater bearishness (e.g., Gemini and Qwen models predicting a 0.7 probability of price fall). Accounting for Nvidia's potentially stronger performance and market sentiment, it's likely Apple's stock price will decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's Galaxy S25 improvements, leveraging Google AI and Qualcomm technology to compete with Apple.  While this is competitive pressure, it's not a catastrophic event for Apple.  The news doesn't reveal any significant weakness in Apple's products or strategies, nor does it predict a major market share shift. The slight dip in Qualcomm's pre-market price suggests the market isn't viewing Samsung's advancements as an immediate, substantial threat to Apple. Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock price movements based on a single news item. Considering the relatively neutral nature of the news and the lack of overwhelmingly negative implications for Apple, coupled with the mixed prediction history showing no strong consensus, a neutral-to-slightly positive outlook is more reasonable.  The probability of a price rise is slightly favored, acknowledging that market reactions can be unpredictable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, this should not concern investors, implying that other factors like strong financials and brand loyalty may outweigh concerns about innovation. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models leaning towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's resilience and financial health, while others highlight potential downsides like regulatory pressures or lack of innovation. Given Apple's historical performance and the mixed sentiment in the market, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google, and other smartphone makers are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This regulatory pressure could potentially impact Apple's business model and revenue streams related to the Indian market. Given that India is a significant and growing market for smartphones, any regulatory changes could have substantial implications. Historically, regulatory pressures can lead to short-term negative stock reactions if investors perceive the changes as threatening to the company's profitability or competitive position. However, Apple's strong market position and adaptability could mitigate long-term effects. Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, with some indicating a higher probability of a stock price fall due to regulatory concerns and others suggesting a more resilient stock performance due to Apple's strong fundamentals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling and a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, which could be seen as a positive signal for the company's stock price. However, AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, suggesting that other stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the previous predictions and the mixed signals from the market, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. Several previous predictions pointed towards a bearish outlook, with various reasons supporting the view that Apple could face regulatory and market pressures that contribute to a negative sentiment. The latest round of predictions maintains a largely bearish tone, with most estimations pointing towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The commentary from Jim Cramer expresses significant concerns about Apple's upcoming earnings, specifically citing declining demand, especially from China, and skepticism regarding the impact of AI innovations on the company's performance. This negative sentiment, combined with broader market perceptions and pressures from competitors like Nvidia and regulatory challenges, indicates a stronger likelihood of a decline in Apple's stock price. Previous predictions from various models have varied, with a trend towards bearishness noted in the last few rounds. Overall, the prevailing outlook is cautious, suggesting a higher probability of falling stock prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The article presents a clear narrative: Nvidia's AI-driven growth is outpacing Apple's, which faces headwinds in China and regulatory challenges in the US. Nvidia boasts superior profit margins and stronger revenue growth. The previous rounds' predictions reveal a trend toward increasing bearishness on Apple as concerns mount. Given Nvidia's momentum and challenges facing apple, a decline in Apple's stock price is the more probable outcome. the motley fool article indicates the opposite of the claim in the title, however, since historically their recommendations leads to opposite outcomes with some delay, I decide to ignore this information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new Galaxy S25 phone, leveraging Google AI and Qualcomm technology to compete with Apple.  While this is competitive pressure, it's not necessarily a major threat to Apple's dominance in the premium smartphone market.  The news itself is relatively neutral; it doesn't reveal any significant weaknesses for Apple, nor does it predict a massive market share shift.  The prior predictions show wide divergence of opinion, but there's a tendency towards bearishness, with many models understating the probability of price increase.  However, some models consistently suggest that Apple\u2019s strong brand, financial health and ecosystem are strong mitigating factors against any significant negative market impact. The slight dip in Qualcomm's pre-market price suggests the market isn't viewing Samsung's advancements as an immediate, substantial threat to Apple.  Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, I estimate a slightly higher probability of no significant change, with a slightly greater weighting toward a small price decline due to prevailing overall bearish sentiment reflected in previous predictions and the competitive landscape.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, investors should not be overly concerned. This implies that the market may not react negatively to the perceived lack of innovation, as other factors like strong financials and brand loyalty could support the stock. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's resilience, while others highlight potential downsides like regulatory pressures or competitive challenges. Given Apple's historical performance and the mixed sentiment in the market, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The provided news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL), along with other smartphone makers like Google, is facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This regulatory pressure could potentially impact Apple's business model and revenue streams related to the Indian market. Given that India is a significant and growing market for smartphones, any regulatory changes could have substantial implications. Historically, regulatory pressures can lead to short-term negative stock reactions if investors perceive the changes as threatening to the company's profitability or competitive position. However, Apple's strong market position and adaptability could mitigate long-term effects. The previous predictions show a trend towards a bearish outlook, with many models estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various factors including regulatory concerns, competitive pressures, and doubts about the company's innovation and earnings growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.
