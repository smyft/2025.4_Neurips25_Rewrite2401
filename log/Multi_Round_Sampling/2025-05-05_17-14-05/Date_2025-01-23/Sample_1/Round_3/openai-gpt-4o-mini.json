(AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, \u201cI think that, regardless, it\u2019s a very pro-business regime.\u201d He explained that his view came despite \u201ca story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].\u201d According to Cramer, the story \u201cis the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it\u2019s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump\u2019s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President\u2019s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. \u201cWell look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down \u2019cause he\u2019s going to get us to pump more,\u201d Cramer outlined. \u201cAnd I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that\u2019s front and center,\u201d he added. However, Cramer cautioned that \u201c[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they\u2019re being told, drill. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll respond to that. I just don\u2019t think that they will.\u201d\n\nContinuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs \u201cmore pipe[line], we\u2019re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.\u201d He outlined that President Trump \u201cbasically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.\u201d Cramer believes that the move was necessary \u201c[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don\u2019t have a lot of what\u2019s known as trains. We don\u2019t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can\u2019t ship more, as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of, facilities. And we don\u2019t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. \u201cSo far China kind of got off the hook,\u201d he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, \u201c[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we\u2019re going to put some guys in. They\u2019re going to make a difference. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it\u2019s the deep state. But you know what I\u2019m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government\u2019s operations. \u201cIt could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he shared.\n\nHe also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. \u201cWhen the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,\u201d Cramer shared. According to him, \u201c[h]e [Biden] wasn\u2019t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn\u2019t like em. He didn\u2019t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That\u2019s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!\u201d\n\nShifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok\u2019s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, \u201c[t]hey handed down, the only time I\u2019ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.\u201d He added according to the court\u2019s opinion, it was clear that \u201cthere is a huge national security risk.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, \u201cRight, but I\u2019m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.\u201d Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, \u201c[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.\u201d\n\nHe also commented on whether there\u2019s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. \u201cThere is! The Supreme Court says it\u2019s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it\u2019s a front door,\u201d Cramer believes. He added, \u201cI think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn\u2019t use that term, but he meant it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(see more details here).Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation - Here's Why\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nConsumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that\u2019s regularly on Cramer\u2019s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs\u2019 death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s gonna miss big. I mean I can\u2019t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven\u2019t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter\u2019s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It\u2019s really. . . .I mean AI\u2019s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how\u2019s Apple gonna do. And they\u2019re gonna say it. They\u2019re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it\u2019s not a surprise! Okay. They\u2019re acting like it\u2019s, they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s the Commanders.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news suggests that Jim Cramer believes Apple Inc. will miss upcoming earnings due to declining demand, particularly from China, and has doubts about the effectiveness of AI in boosting growth. Cramer's perspective is influential, and particularly his pessimism regarding earnings could weigh heavily on investor sentiment. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's current market capitalization leadership and strong margins, it highlights significant headwinds: performance issues in China due to regulatory obstacles regarding Apple Intelligence, and an antitrust suit in the US. The article directly contrasts Apple's relatively slower revenue and earnings growth with Nvidia's explosive growth fueled by the AI boom. Nvidia's superior gross profit margin and stronger forward-looking statements for AI infrastructure spending give a definite edge to Nvidia. Although the article acknowledges the cyclical factors Nvidia might experience, the consensus and thrust of the details seem to favor Nvidia outpacing Apple. The probability of a rise or fall for Apple's stock is further impacted because of the uncertainty in the chinese market where Apple may not be able to provide Apple Intelligence. Also, the regulatory pressures put on Apple by the US Justice department has created doubts in the minds of investors. All this points to potential downsides to Apple's stock price. However, it is worth considering the advertisement at the end of the document where there is some mention of Nvidia not being best placed for investors to buy. Overall, I feel pressure on Apple's stock over this development more than Nvidia.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new Galaxy S25, leveraging Google AI and Qualcomm technology to compete with Apple's iPhone. While this highlights Samsung's efforts to improve its competitiveness, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news doesn't directly threaten Apple's market position or financial performance. The article mentions Apple's iPhone 17 Air, emphasizing its own AI features and suggesting continued strength in the premium market.  Furthermore, the price action of Qualcomm (a competitor mentioned in relation to the news) shows a slight negative movement pre-market, suggesting limited market excitement surrounding this development, potentially indicating that the news is considered less impactful by the market. Therefore, the probability of a stock price change for AAPL due to this news is low, with a slightly higher probability of no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, this should not concern investors. This implies that the market may not react negatively to the perceived lack of innovation, as other factors (e.g., strong financials, brand loyalty, ecosystem) could outweigh this concern. Historically, Apple's stock has been resilient to criticism about innovation due to its consistent performance and revenue streams. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, as the news does not present a material negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other smartphone makers, including Google, are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This development could potentially impact Apple's business model and revenue streams related to the Indian market. Given that India is a significant and growing market for smartphones, any regulatory changes could have substantial implications. However, the exact impact is uncertain and depends on the specifics of how these changes are implemented. Historically, regulatory pressures can lead to short-term negative stock reactions if investors perceive the changes as threatening to the company's profitability or competitive position. Therefore, there is a possibility of a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price. However, Apple's strong market position and adaptability could mitigate long-term effects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, suggesting that other stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Overall, the news is mildly positive for Apple, but not extremely bullish. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the news doesn't directly impact the immediate performance metrics of Apple Inc but reflects a longer-term strategic and regulatory battle.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple Inc. suggests significant concerns about the company's upcoming earnings, particularly citing declining orders from China and skepticism about the effectiveness of AI innovations. Cramer's influence in financial markets typically correlates with stock price movements, and his negative sentiment indicates a higher likelihood of a price decline. Previous predictions have also leaned towards a bearish outlook despite some acknowledging Apple's strong fundamentals. The market's reaction may be more cautious given the prevailing doubts about Apple's performance and external pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a comprehensive analysis suggesting Nvidia has a strong chance of surpassing Apple in market capitalization in 2025. Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth, driven by the booming AI market, significantly outpace Apple's. Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory challenges in the US, impacting its growth potential. While Apple maintains a higher overall gross profit, Nvidia's superior gross profit margin and sales momentum point to a more favorable outlook. The previous rounds indicate mixed sentiment, but tending towards a more negative outlook for Apple, which aligns with the current news content. Factoring in these considerations, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's competitive efforts using Google AI and Qualcomm technology in its Galaxy S25. While this presents a challenge to Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term. The news doesn't directly threaten Apple's core market position or immediately impact its financial performance, which remains strong based on previous analysis.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the consensus leans towards a slight probability of a price decrease, primarily due to the uncertainties highlighted in previous news articles. However, this specific news concerning Samsung's new phone launch is not inherently negative for Apple and is more likely to cause a neutral to slightly positive market reaction.\n\nThe slightly negative pre-market movement for Qualcomm (a key player in the Samsung phone's technology) further supports the idea that the market is not viewing this as a significant threat to Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting a mostly neutral market response to this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, this should not concern investors, implying that other factors like strong financials and brand loyalty may outweigh concerns about innovation. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models (e.g., deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) leaning towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's resilience and financial health. Others (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-4-scout) highlight potential downsides like regulatory pressures or lack of innovation. Given Apple's historical performance and the mixed sentiment in the market, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google, and other smartphone makers are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This regulatory pressure could potentially impact Apple's business model and revenue streams related to the Indian market. Given that India is a significant and growing market for smartphones, any regulatory changes could have substantial implications. Historically, regulatory pressures can lead to short-term negative stock reactions if investors perceive the changes as threatening to the company's profitability or competitive position. However, Apple's strong market position and adaptability could mitigate long-term effects. Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, with some indicating a higher probability of a stock price fall due to regulatory concerns and others suggesting a more resilient stock performance due to Apple's strong fundamentals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling and a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, suggesting that other stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Given this information and considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions on the potential impact of various news stories on Apple's stock price, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The fact that a prominent investor like Dan Loeb has Apple in his portfolio is a positive signal, but the ranking and the mention of other potentially more promising stocks temper this positivity.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the news doesn't directly impact the immediate performance metrics of Apple Inc but reflects a longer-term strategic and regulatory battle. The mix of previous predictions ranges from very bullish (0.6 rise) to very bearish (0.75 fall). Considering the mixed signals and the regulatory uncertainties, the current scenario seems moderately bearish for Apple's stock.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: Jim Cramer expressed strong concerns about Apple Inc.'s upcoming earnings, specifically highlighting the significant drop in orders from China and doubts over the effectiveness of AI innovations. His commentary often influences investor sentiment, leading to a bearish outlook for Apple's stock price. Previous predictions suggest a heavier inclination towards a price decline due to additional regulatory pressures and competitive challenges from other firms, such as Nvidia, which may further weigh on Apple's market position. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of the stock price falling and a correspondingly low probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The article directly compares Apple and Nvidia, suggesting Nvidia could unseat Apple as the largest company. It highlights Nvidia's strong growth in AI, superior gross profit margins, and positive revenue momentum. Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressure in the US. The previous rounds of predictions show an increasing negative sentiment towards Apple. While some models in Round 0 were more balanced, Round 1 demonstrates a shift towards greater bearishness (e.g., Gemini and Qwen models predicting a 0.7 probability of price fall). Accounting for Nvidia's potentially stronger performance and market sentiment, it's likely Apple's stock price will decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's Galaxy S25 improvements, leveraging Google AI and Qualcomm technology to compete with Apple.  While this is competitive pressure, it's not a catastrophic event for Apple.  The news doesn't reveal any significant weakness in Apple's products or strategies, nor does it predict a major market share shift. The slight dip in Qualcomm's pre-market price suggests the market isn't viewing Samsung's advancements as an immediate, substantial threat to Apple. Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock price movements based on a single news item. Considering the relatively neutral nature of the news and the lack of overwhelmingly negative implications for Apple, coupled with the mixed prediction history showing no strong consensus, a neutral-to-slightly positive outlook is more reasonable.  The probability of a price rise is slightly favored, acknowledging that market reactions can be unpredictable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, this should not concern investors, implying that other factors like strong financials and brand loyalty may outweigh concerns about innovation. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models leaning towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's resilience and financial health, while others highlight potential downsides like regulatory pressures or lack of innovation. Given Apple's historical performance and the mixed sentiment in the market, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google, and other smartphone makers are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This regulatory pressure could potentially impact Apple's business model and revenue streams related to the Indian market. Given that India is a significant and growing market for smartphones, any regulatory changes could have substantial implications. Historically, regulatory pressures can lead to short-term negative stock reactions if investors perceive the changes as threatening to the company's profitability or competitive position. However, Apple's strong market position and adaptability could mitigate long-term effects. Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, with some indicating a higher probability of a stock price fall due to regulatory concerns and others suggesting a more resilient stock performance due to Apple's strong fundamentals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling and a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, which could be seen as a positive signal for the company's stock price. However, AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, suggesting that other stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the previous predictions and the mixed signals from the market, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. Several previous predictions pointed towards a bearish outlook, with various reasons supporting the view that Apple could face regulatory and market pressures that contribute to a negative sentiment. The latest round of predictions maintains a largely bearish tone, with most estimations pointing towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
