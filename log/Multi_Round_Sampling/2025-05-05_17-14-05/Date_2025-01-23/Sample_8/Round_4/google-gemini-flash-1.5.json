(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding a probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems could raise concerns about regulatory pressure on Apple, potentially leading to declines in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance of a decline due to scrutiny but not an overwhelming likelihood due to the company's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the potentially relaxed antitrust regulations and Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump could be beneficial, helping avoid tariffs and enabling potential mergers and acquisitions. This positive aspect is partially offset by the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act, which could indirectly impact Apple's suppliers and the availability of key components. Also, the broader focus on AI revenue and spending creates a broader market sentiment context, which Apple needs to navigate effectively. The overall impact is modestly positive due to the potential benefits from Trump's policies being more direct and impactful than potential negative CHIPS Act impacts, and Tim Cook's established relationship.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' escalating conflict with Apple over app store fees and the expansion of Epic's own mobile marketplace. While Epic's actions could potentially pressure Apple to change its policies, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The article highlights Epic's struggles to attract top-tier mobile game developers to its platform, even with financial incentives.  Apple's immense market power and established app store ecosystem suggest that the long-term effects of this conflict on Apple's profitability will be limited, at least in the short to medium term. The legal battle has already played out somewhat, with a court ruling largely favoring Apple in 2023. This news is more of a continuation of an existing dispute than a significant new development that would drastically alter Apple's financial outlook. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction is low. The more probable scenario is no significant change in the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic and suggests that investing in Apple Inc. (AAPL) during a bull market could be beneficial for wealth accumulation. Such positive sentiment in financial news often correlates with increased investor confidence, which can drive stock prices higher. However, the headline itself does not provide specific financial data or fundamental changes to the company's outlook, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Given the general bullish tone, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This news suggests potential regulatory scrutiny and possible antitrust concerns, which could negatively impact Apple's business operations and reputation. As a result, investors may become cautious, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. However, the impact of such regulatory probes is often uncertain and may not necessarily lead to severe consequences. Considering this, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that Apple ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, implying that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns. Given this information, the overall tone of the article is neutral to slightly positive. The fact that Apple is among Loeb's top picks and has a strong financial foundation suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but the ranking and the mention of other potentially more promising stocks temper this enthusiasm.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the news doesn't directly impact the immediate performance metrics of Apple Inc but reflects a longer-term strategic and regulatory battle.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems raises concerns over regulatory scrutiny for Apple, which could impact investor sentiment and stock performance negatively. While there may be some support from Apple's strong brand and established customer loyalty, the immediate impact of regulatory investigations typically leans toward negative sentiment in the markets. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is estimated to be higher, with a significant degree of uncertainty about the long-term effects of such probes. The previous predictions varied, but the trend shows a cautious approach due to the news of regulatory action. Taking this into account, I lean towards a higher probability for a price fall and a lower probability for a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, Tim Cook's good relationship with a potential Trump administration could help Apple avoid tariffs, which is a significant positive considering Apple's reliance on manufacturing in China. Reduced antitrust regulation under Trump could also open up M&A opportunities for Apple. The focus on AI revenue will put Apple's AI spending in the spotlight, adding pressure to show returns on investment. The CHIPS Act uncertainty is a broader risk, but not specific to Apple. The fate of TikTok does not directly affect Apple, but may help either Meta or Google, which indirectly affects Apple. Considering the previous rounds of predicitons, the models gave varied answers, from GPT4o favoring a decrease, Gemini Flash (round 0) and Llama-3 favoring an increase, and Deepseek favoring and increase; therefore, the effect of the news article seems unclear. Considering both the article and the previous rounds of predictions, I slightly favor an increase in the stock price due to the possible Trump effect.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' ongoing battle with Apple over app store fees and the expansion of Epic's own mobile marketplace. While this highlights a continued pressure point for Apple,  the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term.  The article emphasizes Epic's challenges in attracting major developers despite substantial investment, indicating that the threat to Apple's app store dominance remains limited. The previous court rulings largely favored Apple, suggesting that the legal battle is not expected to significantly harm Apple. The news is more of an incremental development in an existing conflict rather than a game-changing event.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a wide range of probabilities but a general tendency towards a slightly higher probability of no significant change (or slight fall), I am assigning a low probability to both a rise and a fall. The overwhelming factor is the lack of immediate material impact of this particular news on Apple's financials.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). The potential investigation by UK regulators into the tech company's operations could raise concerns about regulatory pressure on Apple, potentially leading to declines in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance of a decline due to scrutiny but not an overwhelming likelihood due to the company's resilience.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to negative impacts on Apple's business operations and reputation, suggesting a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Considering the potential regulatory risks and the company's resilience, there is a slightly higher chance of a decline but not an overwhelming likelihood.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that Apple ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, implying that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the positive aspects of Apple's financials and Loeb's investment, but also the relative ranking and the existence of potentially more promising stocks, the overall tone of the article is neutral to slightly positive. This suggests a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but not overwhelmingly so, as the market may already factor in Apple's strengths and the ranking among Loeb's picks might temper enthusiasm.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the article also indicates that Apple has shown resilience in past disputes and continues to maintain a strong market position. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a cautious outlook, with a slightly more bearish trend indicated by higher probabilities of a fall in stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news of a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystems and operating systems suggests potential regulatory scrutiny, which typically raises concerns among investors and can lead to negative impacts on stock prices. Given the varied predictions from previous rounds, there is a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of falling stock prices due to this scrutiny. However, Apple's strong market position and brand loyalty could partially mitigate these effects, resulting in a somewhat balanced outlook. Overall, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline reflecting investor caution in light of regulatory pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Tim Cook's relationship with Trump could help avoid tariffs, and relaxed antitrust regulations could open M&A opportunities. This is positive. On the other hand, AI revenue and spending will be scrutinized, and uncertainty around the CHIPS Act could impact the supply chain. The potential ban of TikTok would indirectly benefit Apple competitors like Meta and Google, which doesn't particularly help Apple. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there has been a wide range of initial sentiments with a slight shift toward negative sentiment, particularly focusing on regulatory scrutiny. However, this news is different from the previous rounds, which mostly focused on regulatory scrutiny. Given that Trump being top of mind for investors could be either a positive or negative, I'm weighing the potential for tariff avoidance and M&A as being slightly more positive than the uncertainty around AI spending and the CHIPS Act. Therefore, I'm giving a slight edge to an increase, influenced by the potential Trump effect.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' continued efforts to challenge Apple's App Store dominance. While this is a long-running dispute, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Epic's struggles to attract major developers to its own store, despite significant investment, suggest that the threat to Apple's App Store ecosystem remains limited in the short term.  The previous court rulings largely favored Apple. The news represents an incremental development in an ongoing conflict, not a major game-changer for Apple's financial prospects.  The previous predictions show a wide range, but there's a general tendency towards a slightly higher probability of no significant change or a small price fall, reflecting the limited immediate impact of this specific news. The fact that Apple is a large, established company with a strong brand and customer loyalty also lessens the impact of this news.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is low, while a slight decrease is more probable but still not a highly likely outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic, suggesting that investing in Apple Inc. (AAPL) during a bull market could be beneficial for wealth accumulation. This positive sentiment in financial news often correlates with increased investor confidence, which can drive stock prices higher. However, the headline itself does not provide specific financial data or fundamental changes to the company's outlook, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Previous predictions show a mixed outlook, with some models leaning towards a rise due to positive sentiment and others towards a fall due to regulatory concerns. Considering the general bullish tone of the headline and the mixed but slightly positive trend in previous predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems raises concerns over regulatory scrutiny for Apple, potentially leading to declines in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the trend showing a cautious approach due to regulatory action, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline. The previous predictions varied, but a general tendency towards a slightly higher probability of a fall in stock price is observed due to potential regulatory risks and their impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company.

Considering the overall positive tone of the article and the mixed predictions from previous models, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising. The fact that Apple is among Loeb's top picks and has a strong financial foundation suggests a positive outlook, but the ranking and the mention of other potentially more promising stocks temper this enthusiasm. Additionally, the lack of immediately Material negative news in the article suggests that the probability of a significant fall is lower.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the article also indicates that Apple has shown resilience in past disputes and continues to maintain a strong market position. The provided previous predictions show varied assessments but a general tendency towards a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline. Taking these factors into account, while the news could cause some investor concern, Apple's strong brand and market power are likely to mitigate severe impacts.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's involvement in a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems raises concerns about regulatory scrutiny. Such scrutiny typically leads to negative sentiment among investors, which could drive the stock price down. This sentiment is supported by previous predictions showing a majority tendency towards a price fall. While Apple possesses a strong brand and loyal customer base which may mitigate some impacts, the potential regulatory risks are significant. Consequently, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on the upcoming earnings season for Big Tech and how a new Trump administration might affect them, particularly Apple. Several factors are at play. On the positive side for Apple's stock price, Tim Cook's good relationship with Trump could lead to avoiding tariffs, and relaxed antitrust regulations could open up M&A opportunities. On the potentially negative side, Apple needs to demonstrate strong AI revenue and justify AI-related spending, which will be under scrutiny. Uncertainty about the CHIPS Act could indirectly affect Apple through its supply chain. The TikTok situation is more relevant to Meta and Google. \n\nConsidering the previous predictions, early rounds focused on regulatory probes (UK) that led to more bearish sentiments. However, this news cycle shifts focus to potential Trump policies. The previous predictions were varied without a clear consensus. The fact that Trump being \"top of mind\" is a wildcard; it depends on interpretation. I would weigh the potential benefits of tariff avoidance and M&A slightly more heavily than the AI spending uncertainties and CHIPS Act implications. Therefore, while there are risks, the potential upsides from a Trump-friendly environment give a slight edge towards a positive stock price movement.\n\nGiven that several models have swayed from negative regulatory scrutiny to slightly positive outlooks, The key is whether the market believes Apple can adapt and thrive under Trump policies. I am leaning towards a neutral-to-slightly-positive shift, as avoiding tariffs would be a substantial win which outweighs AI spending concerns in the short term. Due to the potential benefit from Trump policies, I estimate a slightly more positive probability for a rise.\n\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' escalating battle with Apple over app store fees and the expansion of Epic's own mobile marketplace.  While this is a continuation of an ongoing dispute, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Epic's struggles to attract top-tier developers, despite significant investment, suggest the threat to Apple's app store dominance is limited.  Previous court rulings largely favored Apple. The news is incremental, not a game-changer. The previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a higher probability of no significant change or a small fall.  Apple's size, brand strength, and customer loyalty mitigate the impact.  Considering all factors, the probability of a stock price rise is low, and a slight fall is possible but not highly probable. The overall effect is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to continued pressure, but not dramatically so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic, suggesting that investing in Apple Inc.

The potential for regulatory risks and their impact on investor sentiment suggests a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.
