(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\nNews Content: (Updates with Apple's response in the sixth paragraph.)

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding a probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems could raise concerns about regulatory pressure on Apple, potentially leading to declines in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance of a decline due to scrutiny but not an overwhelming likelihood due to the company's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the potentially relaxed antitrust regulations and Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump could be beneficial, helping avoid tariffs and enabling potential mergers and acquisitions. This positive aspect is partially offset by the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act, which could indirectly impact Apple's suppliers and the availability of key components. Also, the broader focus on AI revenue and spending creates a broader market sentiment context, which Apple needs to navigate effectively. The overall impact is modestly positive due to the potential benefits from Trump's policies being more direct and impactful than potential negative CHIPS Act impacts, and Tim Cook's established relationship.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' escalating conflict with Apple over app store fees and the expansion of Epic's own mobile marketplace. While Epic's actions could potentially pressure Apple to change its policies, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The article highlights Epic's struggles to attract top-tier mobile game developers to its platform, even with financial incentives.  Apple's immense market power and established app store ecosystem suggest that the long-term effects of this conflict on Apple's profitability will be limited, at least in the short to medium term. The legal battle has already played out somewhat, with a court ruling largely favoring Apple in 2023. This news is more of a continuation of an existing dispute than a significant new development that would drastically alter Apple's financial outlook. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction is low. The more probable scenario is no significant change in the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic and suggests that investing in Apple Inc. (AAPL) during a bull market could be beneficial for wealth accumulation. Such positive sentiment in financial news often correlates with increased investor confidence, which can drive stock prices higher. However, the headline itself does not provide specific financial data or fundamental changes to the company's outlook, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Given the general bullish tone, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This news suggests potential regulatory scrutiny and possible antitrust concerns, which could negatively impact Apple's business operations and reputation. As a result, investors may become cautious, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. However, the impact of such regulatory probes is often uncertain and may not necessarily lead to severe consequences. Considering this, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that Apple ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, implying that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns. Given this information, the overall tone of the article is neutral to slightly positive. The fact that Apple is among Loeb's top picks and has a strong financial foundation suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but the ranking and the mention of other potentially more promising stocks temper this enthusiasm.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the news doesn't directly impact the immediate performance metrics of Apple Inc but reflects a longer-term strategic and regulatory battle.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
