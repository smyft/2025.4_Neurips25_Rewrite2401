(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors\nNews Content: Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025.

The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding a probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems could raise concerns about regulatory pressure on Apple, potentially leading to declines in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance of a decline due to scrutiny but not an overwhelming likelihood due to the company's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the potentially relaxed antitrust regulations and Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump could be beneficial, helping avoid tariffs and enabling potential mergers and acquisitions. This positive aspect is partially offset by the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act, which could indirectly impact Apple's suppliers and the availability of key components. Also, the broader focus on AI revenue and spending creates a broader market sentiment context, which Apple needs to navigate effectively. The overall impact is modestly positive due to the potential benefits from Trump's policies being more direct and impactful than potential negative CHIPS Act impacts, and Tim Cook's established relationship.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' escalating conflict with Apple over app store fees and the expansion of Epic's own mobile marketplace. While Epic's actions could potentially pressure Apple to change its policies, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The article highlights Epic's struggles to attract top-tier mobile game developers to its platform, even with financial incentives.  Apple's immense market power and established app store ecosystem suggest that the long-term effects of this conflict on Apple's profitability will be limited, at least in the short to medium term. The legal battle has already played out somewhat, with a court ruling largely favoring Apple in 2023. This news is more of a continuation of an existing dispute than a significant new development that would drastically alter Apple's financial outlook. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction is low. The more probable scenario is no significant change in the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic and suggests that investing in Apple Inc. (AAPL) during a bull market could be beneficial for wealth accumulation. Such positive sentiment in financial news often correlates with increased investor confidence, which can drive stock prices higher. However, the headline itself does not provide specific financial data or fundamental changes to the company's outlook, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Given the general bullish tone, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This news suggests potential regulatory scrutiny and possible antitrust concerns, which could negatively impact Apple's business operations and reputation. As a result, investors may become cautious, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. However, the impact of such regulatory probes is often uncertain and may not necessarily lead to severe consequences. Considering this, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that Apple ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, implying that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns. Given this information, the overall tone of the article is neutral to slightly positive. The fact that Apple is among Loeb's top picks and has a strong financial foundation suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but the ranking and the mention of other potentially more promising stocks temper this enthusiasm.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the news doesn't directly impact the immediate performance metrics of Apple Inc but reflects a longer-term strategic and regulatory battle.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems raises concerns over regulatory scrutiny for Apple, which could impact investor sentiment and stock performance negatively. While there may be some support from Apple's strong brand and established customer loyalty, the immediate impact of regulatory investigations typically leans toward negative sentiment in the markets. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is estimated to be higher, with a significant degree of uncertainty about the long-term effects of such probes. The previous predictions varied, but the trend shows a cautious approach due to the news of regulatory action. Taking this into account, I lean towards a higher probability for a price fall and a lower probability for a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, Tim Cook's good relationship with a potential Trump administration could help Apple avoid tariffs, which is a significant positive considering Apple's reliance on manufacturing in China. Reduced antitrust regulation under Trump could also open up M&A opportunities for Apple. The focus on AI revenue will put Apple's AI spending in the spotlight, adding pressure to show returns on investment. The CHIPS Act uncertainty is a broader risk, but not specific to Apple. The fate of TikTok does not directly affect Apple, but may help either Meta or Google, which indirectly affects Apple. Considering the previous rounds of predicitons, the models gave varied answers, from GPT4o favoring a decrease, Gemini Flash (round 0) and Llama-3 favoring an increase, and Deepseek favoring and increase; therefore, the effect of the news article seems unclear. Considering both the article and the previous rounds of predictions, I slightly favor an increase in the stock price due to the possible Trump effect.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' ongoing battle with Apple over app store fees and the expansion of Epic's own mobile marketplace. While this highlights a continued pressure point for Apple,  the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term.  The article emphasizes Epic's challenges in attracting major developers despite substantial investment, indicating that the threat to Apple's app store dominance remains limited. The previous court rulings largely favored Apple, suggesting that the legal battle is not expected to significantly harm Apple. The news is more of an incremental development in an existing conflict rather than a game-changing event.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a wide range of probabilities but a general tendency towards a slightly higher probability of no significant change (or slight fall), I am assigning a low probability to both a rise and a fall. The overwhelming factor is the lack of immediate material impact of this particular news on Apple's financials.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). The potential investigation by UK regulators into the tech company's operations could raise concerns about regulatory pressure on Apple, potentially leading to declines in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance of a decline due to scrutiny but not an overwhelming likelihood due to the company's resilience.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to negative impacts on Apple's business operations and reputation, suggesting a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Considering the potential regulatory risks and the company's resilience, there is a slightly higher chance of a decline but not an overwhelming likelihood.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb's top stock picks, with Third Point having a $216.7 million stake in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong financial health, commitment to shareholder value, and long-term strategy for talent development and sustainability. However, it also mentions that Apple ranks 12th on the list of Loeb's top picks, implying that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the positive aspects of Apple's financials and Loeb's investment, but also the relative ranking and the existence of potentially more promising stocks, the overall tone of the article is neutral to slightly positive. This suggests a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but not overwhelmingly so, as the market may already factor in Apple's strengths and the ranking among Loeb's picks might temper enthusiasm.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the article also indicates that Apple has shown resilience in past disputes and continues to maintain a strong market position. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a cautious outlook, with a slightly more bearish trend indicated by higher probabilities of a fall in stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
