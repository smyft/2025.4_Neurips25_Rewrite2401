(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors\nNews Content: Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025.

The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple, including regulatory pressures in the U.S. and underperformance in the Chinese market, leading to concerns about future growth. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth due to strong demand for AI technologies and higher profit margins. Given Nvidia's current momentum and Apple's challenges, this raises the probability of Apple's stock price falling relative to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple (and Google). The Indian government wants Apple to pre-install or prominently feature their GOV.in app suite. Both Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant. The government, if unsuccessful in persuasion, threatens legal action or policy directives. While Apple did something similar in Russia, it's clear they prefer to maintain control over their app store ecosystem. There are a few potential negative effects on Apple if they comply fully: 1) It sets a precedent for other governments to demand similar actions, potentially diluting the user experience and Apple's brand. 2) It could lead to increased government influence on the App Store's content and features within India. 3) Users may perceive pre-installed government apps as bloatware or intrusive. However, outright refusal might hurt Apple's relationship with a major market (India). Google's situation is slightly different due to Android's dominant market share, but the overall concerns are similar. The market's reaction will depend on how this standoff evolves. The threat of legal action or policy directives creates uncertainty. Given the sensitivity around government pressure and precedent setting for Apple, and the general uncertainty, there is a slightly increased chance of a stock price dip, although the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline presents a contrasting viewpoint: Zuckerberg's assertion of Apple's lack of innovation versus the article's argument that this shouldn't affect investors.  The article likely provides counterarguments, such as strong brand loyalty, robust existing product lines generating consistent revenue, and potential for future innovations that haven't been publicly revealed, thus mitigating the impact of Zuckerberg's criticism.  While the criticism is potentially negative, the counterarguments presented in the article suggest the market may largely discount it. Therefore, a moderate positive or neutral reaction is more likely than a significant negative one.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the mitigating arguments presented in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, similar to a situation it faced in Russia in 2021. While Apple has shown reluctance to comply, the government may use legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. This situation could lead to increased scrutiny or regulatory hurdles for Apple in India, a significant market. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative, as the news does not directly affect Apple's revenue or profits but could introduce regulatory risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Oracle's plans to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which could potentially lead to a significant increase in its cloud infrastructure sales. However, the article also mentions that Oracle is still a small player in the cloud computing market and that the stock's rally may not be fully justified by its current earnings and revenue growth. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January due to weak iPhone sales, which could be a concern for investors. Given that the news article is about Oracle but also mentions Apple's decline, it seems that the relevant company in question is Apple Inc. Based on the information provided, it appears that the decline in Apple's stock price is due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. Given that Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, this could mitigate negative impacts like tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates potential challenges for Apple, including regulatory pressures and weaker performance in the Chinese market. In contrast, Nvidia's growth trajectory in AI technology positions it favorably for increased stock performance. Apple's reliance on iPhone sales amid a saturated market and the need for innovation to drive growth further exacerbate concerns about its future performance. Previous predictions indicate a consensus of negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to regulatory pressures and underperformance, with probabilities skewed towards a decline. Based on these factors, I estimate a higher probability of falling stock prices for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. The Indian government wants Apple to pre-install the GOV.in app suite, which Apple is reluctant to do due to concerns about user experience and potential government influence. The Indian government has threatened legal actions or policy directives. Apple has previously complied with similar requests in Russia but prefers to maintain control over its app store. This situation presents risks to Apple. Complying could set a precedent for other governments and dilute the user experience. Refusal could damage Apple's relationship with India, a major market. I will consider the predictions of others in the previous rounds. The average rising prediction is about 0.40 and falling prediction is about 0.56. Given the government pressure and precedent-setting implications, I slightly reduced the rising probability and increased falling probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece presents a nuanced perspective on Apple's innovation, contrasting Zuckerberg's criticism with a counterargument suggesting it shouldn't significantly impact investors.  Previous predictions show a divergence of opinion, ranging from a strong belief in a price drop to a moderate expectation of a rise. Several models highlight external factors such as government regulations (India) and broader market trends (AI).  The inconsistent predictions and the nature of the news itself \u2013 a commentary piece rather than a concrete event \u2013 suggest a relatively neutral impact on the stock price in the short term. While Zuckerberg's comment might slightly negatively influence sentiment, the article's counterarguments mitigate this. The overall uncertainty and lack of significant new negative information means the probability of a price rise is only slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing regulatory pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, similar to a previous situation in Russia. While Apple has shown reluctance, the government may enforce compliance through legal actions or policy directives. This introduces regulatory risks and uncertainty in a significant market like India. However, the immediate impact on Apple's revenue or profits is likely minimal. Given the mixed signals and the potential for negative sentiment due to regulatory challenges, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a divide between the US and EU over Big Tech, with President Trump criticizing the EU's antitrust battles with American tech giants like Apple. Trump views the EU's fines as a form of taxation on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple and other US tech companies by creating a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump's administration. However, the ongoing antitrust suits and regulatory pressures both in the US and EU create uncertainty. Considering the mixed implications and previous predictions, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than falling, but still within a close range.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Oracle's plans to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which could potentially lead to a significant increase in its cloud infrastructure sales. However, the article also mentions that Oracle is still a small player in the cloud computing market and that the stock's rally may not be fully justified by its current earnings and revenue growth. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January due to weak iPhone sales, which could be a concern for investors. Given that the news article is about Oracle but also mentions Apple's decline, it seems that the relevant company in question is Apple Inc. Based on the information provided, it appears that the decline in Apple's stock price is due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Furthermore, the predictions from other models indicate a general trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price. Considering this information, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. Given that Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, this could mitigate negative impacts like tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance. The recent negative trends for Apple, such as weak iPhone sales, and comparative underperformance against other tech stocks also contribute to a cautious outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple faces substantial challenges, including regulatory pressures in both the U.S. and significant markets like China, where it struggles with partnerships critical for product offerings. Additionally, the company's performance in a saturated smartphone market and the necessity for innovation to drive sales contribute to a bleak outlook. Conversely, Nvidia's strong growth in AI technologies positions it favorably against Apple, which could further diminish investor confidence in Apple's stock. Previous predictions indicate a trend of negative sentiment toward Apple's stock price due to these ongoing concerns. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a decline in Apple's stock price and a lower probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential issue for Apple in India, a significant market. The Indian government wants Apple to host their GOV.in app suite, which Apple is reluctant to do, raising concerns about app store control and user experience. The threat of legal action or policy directives from the Indian government adds uncertainty. While Apple complied in Russia previously, this doesn't guarantee the same outcome in India. Previous predictions also lean towards a negative outlook due to these regulatory pressures. The average of the previous round has the probability of stock price rise at around 0.39 and fall at around 0.61. The latest round takes the previous rounds into consideration. The current situation presents risks, although not a guaranteed negative impact, so I'll make only a small adjustment to those values.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a relatively neutral outlook on Apple's future, contrasting Zuckerberg's critique of Apple's innovation with arguments suggesting this shouldn't significantly impact investors.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty.  Several models highlight external factors such as government regulations (India) and general market trends (AI). The lack of significant new negative information and the mostly speculative nature of the presented concerns (Zuckerberg's comment and potential regulatory issues in India) suggest a limited impact on the stock price in the short term. While the negative sentiment expressed by some models lingers, the counterarguments in the article and the overall lack of concrete negative news contribute to a more neutral prediction, slightly leaning towards a probability of a price fall due to the accumulating slightly-negative sentiment from previous predictions. The overall uncertainty and lack of significant new information makes a significant move in either direction unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a regulatory challenge for Apple in India, where the government is pushing for the pre-installation of the GOV.in app suite on Apple devices. Apple's reluctance to comply could lead to legal actions or policy directives, introducing regulatory risks in a significant market. While the immediate financial impact may be minimal, the potential for negative sentiment and precedent-setting implications for other markets could weigh on investor confidence. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting concerns over regulatory pressures and market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a divide between the US and EU over Big Tech, with President Trump criticizing the EU's antitrust battles with American tech giants like Apple. Trump views the EU's fines as a form of taxation on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple and other US tech companies by creating a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump's administration. However, the ongoing antitrust suits and regulatory pressures both in the US and EU create uncertainty. Considering the mixed implications and previous predictions, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than falling, but still within a close range. The previous predictions show a general trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price, with many models indicating a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's plan to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which may have implications for the broader tech industry, including Apple Inc. However, the article specifically mentions Apple's decline in stock price due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Considering the information provided and the previous predictions from other models, which indicate a general trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, regulatory pressures, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. On the positive side, Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, which could potentially mitigate the negative impacts of tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance. The recent negative trends for Apple, such as weak iPhone sales, and comparative underperformance against other tech stocks contribute to a cautious outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges Apple faces, including regulatory pressures in major markets and underperformance in regions like China. The continuing saturation of the smartphone market further threatens Apple's growth, contrasting sharply with Nvidia's strong performance driven by AI demand. Models indicate a consensus of negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to these ongoing issues, leading to a higher likelihood of a decline in stock price compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.36, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.64, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential regulatory hurdle for Apple in India, a significant market. The Indian government's request for pre-installation of the GOV.in app suite, coupled with Apple's reluctance, introduces uncertainty and the risk of legal action or policy directives. While the immediate financial impact may be limited, the precedent-setting nature and potential for strained relations with the Indian government could negatively affect investor sentiment. Previous predictions reveal a consistently skewed outlook towards a potential stock price decline, factoring in regulatory pressures and market's reaction. Considering these elements, I slightly adjust the prior round's average probabilities to reflect a continued leaning towards a decrease in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article presents a relatively neutral stance on Apple's innovation, contrasting Zuckerberg's criticism with arguments suggesting it shouldn't significantly impact investors.  However, the consistent trend across multiple prediction rounds indicates a prevailing negative sentiment towards Apple's stock.  This negative sentiment stems from multiple factors, including:  regulatory pressures in India, potential challenges in the Chinese market, the saturated smartphone market, and a relative lack of significant recent innovations compared to competitors like Nvidia.  While the article attempts to mitigate the negative impact of Zuckerberg's comments, the consistent negative predictions from other models, and the lack of strong positive news, outweigh the article's relatively optimistic outlook. The cumulative negative factors, especially regulatory uncertainty, suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  I've taken into account the average predictions from previous rounds, which strongly lean towards a price drop, and adjusted my prediction to reflect the prevailing uncertainty and the consistent negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights regulatory pressure on Apple in India, where the government is pushing for the pre-installation of the GOV.in app suite on Apple devices. Apple's reluctance to comply could lead to legal actions or policy directives, introducing regulatory risks in a significant market. While the immediate financial impact may be minimal, the potential for negative sentiment and precedent-setting implications for other markets could weigh on investor confidence. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting concerns over regulatory pressures and market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a divide between the US and EU over Big Tech, with President Trump criticizing the EU's antitrust battles with American tech giants like Apple. Trump views the EU's fines as a form of taxation on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple and other US tech companies by creating a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump's administration. However, the ongoing antitrust suits and regulatory pressures both in the US and EU create uncertainty. Considering the mixed implications and previous predictions, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than falling, but still within a close range.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Oracle's plans to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which may have implications for the broader tech industry. However, it also mentions Apple Inc.'s decline in stock price due to weak iPhone sales. Given that the news does not directly impact Apple but discusses the competitive landscape and regulatory environment, I considered the indirect implications and previous predictions. Many models indicate a trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price, with concerns over regulatory pressures, market sentiment, and comparative underperformance against other tech stocks. The article's mention of Apple's decline and the general uncertainty in the tech industry contribute to a cautious outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, regulatory pressures, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. On the positive side, Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, which could potentially mitigate the negative impacts of tariffs on goods from China.
