(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple, including regulatory pressures in the U.S. and underperformance in the Chinese market, leading to concerns about future growth. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth due to strong demand for AI technologies and higher profit margins. Given Nvidia's current momentum and Apple's challenges, this raises the probability of Apple's stock price falling relative to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple (and Google). The Indian government wants Apple to pre-install or prominently feature their GOV.in app suite. Both Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant. The government, if unsuccessful in persuasion, threatens legal action or policy directives. While Apple did something similar in Russia, it's clear they prefer to maintain control over their app store ecosystem. There are a few potential negative effects on Apple if they comply fully: 1) It sets a precedent for other governments to demand similar actions, potentially diluting the user experience and Apple's brand. 2) It could lead to increased government influence on the App Store's content and features within India. 3) Users may perceive pre-installed government apps as bloatware or intrusive. However, outright refusal might hurt Apple's relationship with a major market (India). Google's situation is slightly different due to Android's dominant market share, but the overall concerns are similar. The market's reaction will depend on how this standoff evolves. The threat of legal action or policy directives creates uncertainty. Given the sensitivity around government pressure and precedent setting for Apple, and the general uncertainty, there is a slightly increased chance of a stock price dip, although the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline presents a contrasting viewpoint: Zuckerberg's assertion of Apple's lack of innovation versus the article's argument that this shouldn't affect investors.  The article likely provides counterarguments, such as strong brand loyalty, robust existing product lines generating consistent revenue, and potential for future innovations that haven't been publicly revealed, thus mitigating the impact of Zuckerberg's criticism.  While the criticism is potentially negative, the counterarguments presented in the article suggest the market may largely discount it. Therefore, a moderate positive or neutral reaction is more likely than a significant negative one.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the mitigating arguments presented in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, similar to a situation it faced in Russia in 2021. While Apple has shown reluctance to comply, the government may use legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. This situation could lead to increased scrutiny or regulatory hurdles for Apple in India, a significant market. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative, as the news does not directly affect Apple's revenue or profits but could introduce regulatory risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Oracle's plans to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which could potentially lead to a significant increase in its cloud infrastructure sales. However, the article also mentions that Oracle is still a small player in the cloud computing market and that the stock's rally may not be fully justified by its current earnings and revenue growth. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January due to weak iPhone sales, which could be a concern for investors. Given that the news article is about Oracle but also mentions Apple's decline, it seems that the relevant company in question is Apple Inc. Based on the information provided, it appears that the decline in Apple's stock price is due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. Given that Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, this could mitigate negative impacts like tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates potential challenges for Apple, including regulatory pressures and weaker performance in the Chinese market. In contrast, Nvidia's growth trajectory in AI technology positions it favorably for increased stock performance. Apple's reliance on iPhone sales amid a saturated market and the need for innovation to drive growth further exacerbate concerns about its future performance. Previous predictions indicate a consensus of negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to regulatory pressures and underperformance, with probabilities skewed towards a decline. Based on these factors, I estimate a higher probability of falling stock prices for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. The Indian government wants Apple to pre-install the GOV.in app suite, which Apple is reluctant to do due to concerns about user experience and potential government influence. The Indian government has threatened legal actions or policy directives. Apple has previously complied with similar requests in Russia but prefers to maintain control over its app store. This situation presents risks to Apple. Complying could set a precedent for other governments and dilute the user experience. Refusal could damage Apple's relationship with India, a major market. I will consider the predictions of others in the previous rounds. The average rising prediction is about 0.40 and falling prediction is about 0.56. Given the government pressure and precedent-setting implications, I slightly reduced the rising probability and increased falling probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece presents a nuanced perspective on Apple's innovation, contrasting Zuckerberg's criticism with a counterargument suggesting it shouldn't significantly impact investors.  Previous predictions show a divergence of opinion, ranging from a strong belief in a price drop to a moderate expectation of a rise. Several models highlight external factors such as government regulations (India) and broader market trends (AI).  The inconsistent predictions and the nature of the news itself \u2013 a commentary piece rather than a concrete event \u2013 suggest a relatively neutral impact on the stock price in the short term. While Zuckerberg's comment might slightly negatively influence sentiment, the article's counterarguments mitigate this. The overall uncertainty and lack of significant new negative information means the probability of a price rise is only slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing regulatory pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, similar to a previous situation in Russia. While Apple has shown reluctance, the government may enforce compliance through legal actions or policy directives. This introduces regulatory risks and uncertainty in a significant market like India. However, the immediate impact on Apple's revenue or profits is likely minimal. Given the mixed signals and the potential for negative sentiment due to regulatory challenges, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a divide between the US and EU over Big Tech, with President Trump criticizing the EU's antitrust battles with American tech giants like Apple. Trump views the EU's fines as a form of taxation on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple and other US tech companies by creating a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump's administration. However, the ongoing antitrust suits and regulatory pressures both in the US and EU create uncertainty. Considering the mixed implications and previous predictions, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than falling, but still within a close range.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Oracle's plans to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which could potentially lead to a significant increase in its cloud infrastructure sales. However, the article also mentions that Oracle is still a small player in the cloud computing market and that the stock's rally may not be fully justified by its current earnings and revenue growth.

Based on the information provided, it appears that the decline in Apple's stock price is due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Furthermore, the predictions from other models indicate a general trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price. Considering this information, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. Given that Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, this could mitigate negative impacts like tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance. The recent negative trends for Apple, such as weak iPhone sales, and comparative underperformance against other tech stocks also contribute to a cautious outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple faces substantial challenges, including regulatory pressures in both the U.S. and significant markets like China, where it struggles with partnerships critical for product offerings. Additionally, the company's performance in a saturated smartphone market and the necessity for innovation to drive sales contribute to a bleak outlook. Conversely, Nvidia's strong growth in AI technologies positions it favorably against Apple, which could further diminish investor confidence in Apple's stock. Previous predictions indicate a trend of negative sentiment toward Apple's stock price due to these ongoing concerns. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a decline in Apple's stock price and a lower probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential issue for Apple in India, a significant market. The Indian government wants Apple to host their GOV.in app suite, which Apple is reluctant to do, raising concerns about app store control and user experience. The threat of legal action or policy directives from the Indian government adds uncertainty. While Apple complied in Russia previously, this doesn't guarantee the same outcome in India. Previous predictions also lean towards a negative outlook due to these regulatory pressures. The average of the previous round has the probability of stock price rise at around 0.39 and fall at around 0.61. The latest round takes the previous rounds into consideration. The current situation presents risks, although not a guaranteed negative impact, so I'll make only a small adjustment to those values.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a relatively neutral outlook on Apple's future, contrasting Zuckerberg's critique of Apple's innovation with arguments suggesting this shouldn't significantly impact investors.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty.  Several models highlight external factors such as government regulations (India) and general market trends (AI). The lack of significant new negative information and the mostly speculative nature of the presented concerns (Zuckerberg's comment and potential regulatory issues in India) suggest a limited impact on the stock price in the short term. While the negative sentiment expressed by some models lingers, the counterarguments in the article and the overall lack of concrete negative news contribute to a more neutral prediction, slightly leaning towards a probability of a price fall due to the accumulating slightly-negative sentiment from previous predictions. The overall uncertainty and lack of significant new information makes a significant move in either direction unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a regulatory challenge for Apple in India, where the government is pushing for the pre-installation of the GOV.in app suite on Apple devices. Apple's reluctance to comply could lead to legal actions or policy directives, introducing regulatory risks in a significant market. While the immediate financial impact may be minimal, the potential for negative sentiment and precedent-setting implications for other markets could weigh on investor confidence. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting concerns over regulatory pressures and market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a divide between the US and EU over Big Tech, with President Trump criticizing the EU's antitrust battles with American tech giants like Apple. Trump views the EU's fines as a form of taxation on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple and other US tech companies by creating a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump's administration. However, the ongoing antitrust suits and regulatory pressures both in the US and EU create uncertainty. Considering the mixed implications and previous predictions, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than falling, but still within a close range. The previous predictions show a general trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price, with many models indicating a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's plan to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which may have implications for the broader tech industry, including Apple Inc. However, the article specifically mentions Apple's decline in stock price due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Considering the information provided and the previous predictions from other models, which indicate a general trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, regulatory pressures, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. On the positive side, Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, which could potentially mitigate the negative impacts of tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance. The recent negative trends for Apple, such as weak iPhone sales, and comparative underperformance against other tech stocks contribute to a cautious outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges Apple faces, including regulatory pressures in major markets and underperformance in regions like China. The continuing saturation of the smartphone market further threatens Apple's growth, contrasting sharply with Nvidia's strong performance driven by AI demand. Models indicate a consensus of negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to these ongoing issues, leading to a higher likelihood of a decline in stock price compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.36, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.64, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential regulatory hurdle for Apple in India, a significant market. The Indian government's request for pre-installation of the GOV.in app suite, coupled with Apple's reluctance, introduces uncertainty and the risk of legal action or policy directives. While the immediate financial impact may be limited, the precedent-setting nature and potential for strained relations with the Indian government could negatively affect investor sentiment. Previous predictions reveal a consistently skewed outlook towards a potential stock price decline, factoring in regulatory pressures and market's reaction. Considering these elements, I slightly adjust the prior round's average probabilities to reflect a continued leaning towards a decrease in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article presents a relatively neutral stance on Apple's innovation, contrasting Zuckerberg's criticism with arguments suggesting it shouldn't significantly impact investors.  However, the consistent trend across multiple prediction rounds indicates a prevailing negative sentiment towards Apple's stock.  This negative sentiment stems from multiple factors, including:  regulatory pressures in India, potential challenges in the Chinese market, the saturated smartphone market, and a relative lack of significant recent innovations compared to competitors like Nvidia.  While the article attempts to mitigate the negative impact of Zuckerberg's comments, the consistent negative predictions from other models, and the lack of strong positive news, outweigh the article's relatively optimistic outlook. The cumulative negative factors, especially regulatory uncertainty, suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  I've taken into account the average predictions from previous rounds, which strongly lean towards a price drop, and adjusted my prediction to reflect the prevailing uncertainty and the consistent negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights regulatory pressure on Apple in India, where the government is pushing for the pre-installation of the GOV.in app suite on Apple devices. Apple's reluctance to comply could lead to legal actions or policy directives, introducing regulatory risks in a significant market. While the immediate financial impact may be minimal, the potential for negative sentiment and precedent-setting implications for other markets could weigh on investor confidence. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting concerns over regulatory pressures and market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a divide between the US and EU over Big Tech, with President Trump criticizing the EU's antitrust battles with American tech giants like Apple.

However, it also mentions Apple Inc.'s decline in stock price due to weak iPhone sales. Given that the news does not directly impact Apple but discusses the competitive landscape and regulatory environment, I considered the indirect implications and previous predictions. Many models indicate a trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price, with concerns over regulatory pressures, market sentiment, and comparative underperformance against other tech stocks. The article's mention of Apple's decline and the general uncertainty in the tech industry contribute to a cautious outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, regulatory pressures, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act.
