(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Could Nvidia Unseat Apple as the Largest Company in the World in 2025?\nNews Content: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are the two largest companies in the world by market capitalization. While Nvidia is valued at roughly $3.38 trillion as of this writing and stands as the second-biggest business, Apple has a valuation of $3.46 trillion and is at the top of the heap.\n\nNotably, both of these tech giants are leaders in different corners of the hardware market. Nvidia is the leading designer of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) and data center computing. Meanwhile, Apple leads the smartphone market with its iPhone lines and captures the majority of global operating profits from mobile phone sales.\n\nAs hardware-focused businesses, Apple and Nvidia's position atop the list of the world's most valuable companies looks even more noteworthy because software-focused businesses usually tend to be more profitable. But while Apple should be able to continue commanding very strong margins on its mobile hardware and other offerings in 2025, the stage could be set for Nvidia to deliver superior stock performance and take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" this year.\n\nNvidia's outlook for 2025 appears stronger than Apple's\n\nNvidia stock has been on an incredible run as rising demand for AI technologies has spurred massive sales and earnings growth for the company. The AI leader's share price rocketed 131.5% higher over the last year, and there were brief periods in 2024 when it had a higher market cap than Apple and stood as the world's largest company. While Nvidia's business has historically been shaped by cyclical demand trends in the semiconductor industry and will face tougher growth comparisons in 2025, its outlook still appears stronger than Apple's.\n\nApple is facing some performance headwinds in China -- its second-largest geographic segment by revenue. The mobile hardware giant hasn't been able to find a suitable Chinese partner to incorporate its Apple Intelligence platform into its latest iPhones. Due to regulations put in place by China's government, many products and services need to have a domestic operational partner in order to be sold in the country. As a result, the iPhone 16s in China do not have the Apple Intelligence platform and are facing a tougher competitive environment because of it.\n\nApple is also facing some regulatory pressures in the domestic market. In March of last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against the company alleging that it has created an illegal monopoly on the smartphone market by tying developers into its ecosystem through contractual restrictions. While it's possible that the DOJ under the new Trump administration will take a comparatively hands-off approach to antitrust matters and other issues compared to operations under the Biden administration, it's not clear the iPhone maker will benefit from this dynamic.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMargins and sales trends support Nvidia taking the crown\n\nOver the trailing-12-month period, Apple posted a gross profit of $180.7 billion on sales of $391 billion -- good for a gross margin of 46.2%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has posted a gross profit of $85.9 billion on sales of $113.3 billion across the same stretch -- representing a gross margin of 75.8%. So while Apple has generated far more overall sales and gross profit over the past year, Nvidia's gross profit margin is far higher. This distinction becomes even more significant when looking at recent sales momentum for both businesses.\n\nNvidia's revenue increased 94% year over year to reach $35.1 billion in its most recently reported quarter (ended Oct. 27, 2024). Earnings per share for the period surged 111% annually to reach $0.78.\n\nFor comparison, Apple's revenue increased 6% year over year to $94.9 billion -- and its diluted earnings per share rose 12% to hit $1.64. Market data from Counterpoint Research suggests that Apple's iPhone unit shipments fell 5% year over year in the final quarter of 2024, so sales growth will be harder to deliver with its next financial report.\n\nIn order to return to stronger sales and earnings growth, Apple may need to deliver a new product or a software service offering with a more groundbreaking impact. The company's iPhone lines reliably serve up strong sales and great margins, but the smartphone market is saturated -- and growth has become harder to deliver.\n\nIn contrast, the demand outlook for Nvidia's GPUs continues to be very strong in 2025 amid ongoing AI infrastructure spending, and the rollout of the company's new Blackwell processors should support strong sales expansion and margins. With that in mind, I think there's a very good chance that Nvidia will take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" back from Apple and hold on to it for most of this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple, including regulatory pressures in the U.S. and underperformance in the Chinese market, leading to concerns about future growth. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth due to strong demand for AI technologies and higher profit margins. Given Nvidia's current momentum and Apple's challenges, this raises the probability of Apple's stock price falling relative to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple (and Google). The Indian government wants Apple to pre-install or prominently feature their GOV.in app suite. Both Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant. The government, if unsuccessful in persuasion, threatens legal action or policy directives. While Apple did something similar in Russia, it's clear they prefer to maintain control over their app store ecosystem. There are a few potential negative effects on Apple if they comply fully: 1) It sets a precedent for other governments to demand similar actions, potentially diluting the user experience and Apple's brand. 2) It could lead to increased government influence on the App Store's content and features within India. 3) Users may perceive pre-installed government apps as bloatware or intrusive. However, outright refusal might hurt Apple's relationship with a major market (India). Google's situation is slightly different due to Android's dominant market share, but the overall concerns are similar. The market's reaction will depend on how this standoff evolves. The threat of legal action or policy directives creates uncertainty. Given the sensitivity around government pressure and precedent setting for Apple, and the general uncertainty, there is a slightly increased chance of a stock price dip, although the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline presents a contrasting viewpoint: Zuckerberg's assertion of Apple's lack of innovation versus the article's argument that this shouldn't affect investors.  The article likely provides counterarguments, such as strong brand loyalty, robust existing product lines generating consistent revenue, and potential for future innovations that haven't been publicly revealed, thus mitigating the impact of Zuckerberg's criticism.  While the criticism is potentially negative, the counterarguments presented in the article suggest the market may largely discount it. Therefore, a moderate positive or neutral reaction is more likely than a significant negative one.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the mitigating arguments presented in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, similar to a situation it faced in Russia in 2021. While Apple has shown reluctance to comply, the government may use legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. This situation could lead to increased scrutiny or regulatory hurdles for Apple in India, a significant market. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative, as the news does not directly affect Apple's revenue or profits but could introduce regulatory risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Oracle's plans to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which could potentially lead to a significant increase in its cloud infrastructure sales. However, the article also mentions that Oracle is still a small player in the cloud computing market and that the stock's rally may not be fully justified by its current earnings and revenue growth. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January due to weak iPhone sales, which could be a concern for investors. Given that the news article is about Oracle but also mentions Apple's decline, it seems that the relevant company in question is Apple Inc. Based on the information provided, it appears that the decline in Apple's stock price is due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. Given that Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, this could mitigate negative impacts like tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
