(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Oracle Takes Run at Cloud\u2019s Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple, including regulatory pressures in the U.S. and underperformance in the Chinese market, leading to concerns about future growth. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth due to strong demand for AI technologies and higher profit margins. Given Nvidia's current momentum and Apple's challenges, this raises the probability of Apple's stock price falling relative to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple (and Google). The Indian government wants Apple to pre-install or prominently feature their GOV.in app suite. Both Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant. The government, if unsuccessful in persuasion, threatens legal action or policy directives. While Apple did something similar in Russia, it's clear they prefer to maintain control over their app store ecosystem. There are a few potential negative effects on Apple if they comply fully: 1) It sets a precedent for other governments to demand similar actions, potentially diluting the user experience and Apple's brand. 2) It could lead to increased government influence on the App Store's content and features within India. 3) Users may perceive pre-installed government apps as bloatware or intrusive. However, outright refusal might hurt Apple's relationship with a major market (India). Google's situation is slightly different due to Android's dominant market share, but the overall concerns are similar. The market's reaction will depend on how this standoff evolves. The threat of legal action or policy directives creates uncertainty. Given the sensitivity around government pressure and precedent setting for Apple, and the general uncertainty, there is a slightly increased chance of a stock price dip, although the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline presents a contrasting viewpoint: Zuckerberg's assertion of Apple's lack of innovation versus the article's argument that this shouldn't affect investors.  The article likely provides counterarguments, such as strong brand loyalty, robust existing product lines generating consistent revenue, and potential for future innovations that haven't been publicly revealed, thus mitigating the impact of Zuckerberg's criticism.  While the criticism is potentially negative, the counterarguments presented in the article suggest the market may largely discount it. Therefore, a moderate positive or neutral reaction is more likely than a significant negative one.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the mitigating arguments presented in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, similar to a situation it faced in Russia in 2021. While Apple has shown reluctance to comply, the government may use legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. This situation could lead to increased scrutiny or regulatory hurdles for Apple in India, a significant market. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative, as the news does not directly affect Apple's revenue or profits but could introduce regulatory risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Oracle's plans to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which could potentially lead to a significant increase in its cloud infrastructure sales. However, the article also mentions that Oracle is still a small player in the cloud computing market and that the stock's rally may not be fully justified by its current earnings and revenue growth. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January due to weak iPhone sales, which could be a concern for investors. Given that the news article is about Oracle but also mentions Apple's decline, it seems that the relevant company in question is Apple Inc. Based on the information provided, it appears that the decline in Apple's stock price is due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. Given that Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, this could mitigate negative impacts like tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates potential challenges for Apple, including regulatory pressures and weaker performance in the Chinese market. In contrast, Nvidia's growth trajectory in AI technology positions it favorably for increased stock performance. Apple's reliance on iPhone sales amid a saturated market and the need for innovation to drive growth further exacerbate concerns about its future performance. Previous predictions indicate a consensus of negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to regulatory pressures and underperformance, with probabilities skewed towards a decline. Based on these factors, I estimate a higher probability of falling stock prices for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. The Indian government wants Apple to pre-install the GOV.in app suite, which Apple is reluctant to do due to concerns about user experience and potential government influence. The Indian government has threatened legal actions or policy directives. Apple has previously complied with similar requests in Russia but prefers to maintain control over its app store. This situation presents risks to Apple. Complying could set a precedent for other governments and dilute the user experience. Refusal could damage Apple's relationship with India, a major market. I will consider the predictions of others in the previous rounds. The average rising prediction is about 0.40 and falling prediction is about 0.56. Given the government pressure and precedent-setting implications, I slightly reduced the rising probability and increased falling probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece presents a nuanced perspective on Apple's innovation, contrasting Zuckerberg's criticism with a counterargument suggesting it shouldn't significantly impact investors.  Previous predictions show a divergence of opinion, ranging from a strong belief in a price drop to a moderate expectation of a rise. Several models highlight external factors such as government regulations (India) and broader market trends (AI).  The inconsistent predictions and the nature of the news itself \u2013 a commentary piece rather than a concrete event \u2013 suggest a relatively neutral impact on the stock price in the short term. While Zuckerberg's comment might slightly negatively influence sentiment, the article's counterarguments mitigate this. The overall uncertainty and lack of significant new negative information means the probability of a price rise is only slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing regulatory pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, similar to a previous situation in Russia. While Apple has shown reluctance, the government may enforce compliance through legal actions or policy directives. This introduces regulatory risks and uncertainty in a significant market like India. However, the immediate impact on Apple's revenue or profits is likely minimal. Given the mixed signals and the potential for negative sentiment due to regulatory challenges, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a divide between the US and EU over Big Tech, with President Trump criticizing the EU's antitrust battles with American tech giants like Apple. Trump views the EU's fines as a form of taxation on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple and other US tech companies by creating a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump's administration. However, the ongoing antitrust suits and regulatory pressures both in the US and EU create uncertainty. Considering the mixed implications and previous predictions, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than falling, but still within a close range.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Oracle's plans to expand its cloud business with a $100 billion joint venture, which could potentially lead to a significant increase in its cloud infrastructure sales. However, the article also mentions that Oracle is still a small player in the cloud computing market and that the stock's rally may not be fully justified by its current earnings and revenue growth.

Based on the information provided, it appears that the decline in Apple's stock price is due to weak iPhone sales, which could continue to be a concern for investors. Furthermore, the predictions from other models indicate a general trend of uncertainty and potential decline in Apple's stock price. Considering this information, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple potential factors affecting Apple Inc., including the impact of Trump's administration, AI investments, and the status of the CHIPS Act. Given that Apple CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, this could mitigate negative impacts like tariffs on goods from China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act could pose challenges for Apple's supply chain. Additionally, investor sentiment influenced by AI revenue and spending reports from companies like Microsoft and Meta could set market expectations, impacting Apple's stock performance. The recent negative trends for Apple, such as weak iPhone sales, and comparative underperformance against other tech stocks also contribute to a cautious outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
