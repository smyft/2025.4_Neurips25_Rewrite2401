(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI technology in upcoming products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both Buffett's investment decisions and Apple's strategic investments in AI could lead to an upward movement in Apple\u2019s stock price. However, fluctuations and profit-taking may still occur in the short term. Thus, while the probability of a price rise is high, there is also some risk of a minor pullback, especially in reaction to broader market trends.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, the stock is down 8% YTD, and Jefferies downgraded the stock due to concerns about weak iPhone sales (17, 18, and SE 4) and potentially disappointing Q1 results and guidance. The news also mentions Apple losing its position as world's most valuable company to Nvidia. However, Wedbush maintains an \"Outperform\" rating with a significantly higher price target ($325). They believe concerns are overblown, see manageable unit declines in China, and are optimistic about Apple's AI strategy, particularly the selection of an AI partner in China (Baidu, Tencent, ByteDance considered). Wedbush views 2025 as a 'fork in the road' year, indicating potential for significant change, both positive and negative. The slightly positive movement of 0.25% on Wednesday suggests a tentative rebound or stabilization. Considering both the bearish and bullish views, the negative aspects initially seem to carry more weight due to the downgrade and stock decline, however, Wedbush's counterargument regarding AI 'renaissance' and high price target offer a strong bullish perspective that could sway investor sentiment, even if success will be gradual. The overall market sentiment could also play a role. Given that the situation is contradictory, the probabilities are adjusted accordingly while taking into account the more negative initial news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant investment in Apple (AAPL), representing 22.7% of their portfolio.  While the article mentions Buffett's past selling of some Apple stock,  it emphasizes Apple's strategic investments in AI, particularly the Apple Intelligence software and its integration with existing Apple devices (over 2.2 billion active devices). This positions Apple to potentially benefit from the growth of the AI market as a major distributor of AI to consumers. The article's focus on AI's positive impact on other companies in Berkshire's portfolio further reinforces the potential for AI-driven growth in Apple. However, the fact that Buffett already sold a large portion of his Apple holdings suggests some level of caution, and there's no guarantee of continued growth.  Therefore, while the news is generally positive, it's not overwhelmingly so, leading to a moderate probability of price increase and a low probability of a decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, which could potentially threaten Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal, as Epic's store is still in its early stages and none of the top 100 mobile game developers have joined yet. The legal and competitive pressures are not new, and Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is part of its ongoing dispute with Apple and Google over app-store fees. This development may be seen as a negative for Apple, as it potentially threatens the company's revenue stream from its App Store. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited, as the company has a diverse range of revenue streams and a strong brand. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple has already made some concessions, such as opening up its App Store to outside payment options, which may mitigate the negative impact. Overall, the news is likely to have a small negative impact on Apple's stock price, but the probability of a significant decline is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests that despite concerns about a lack of innovation at Apple Inc., as pointed out by Mark Zuckerberg, investors should not be overly concerned. The article provides context as to why innovation issues may not have a significant impact on the company's stock performance. This positive framing might reassure current and potential investors, potentially stabilizing or even slightly increasing the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news emphasizes Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, positioning the company well within the growing AI sector. While there are some concerns regarding iPhone sales and market competition, the overall sentiment is positive due to Apple's strategic focus on AI and its established ecosystem of active devices. The historical performance and ongoing innovations further support potential stock price gains. Given the mixed signals from other analyses, I estimate a higher likelihood of price rise, but accept a reasonable risk of price decline due to the current market dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade and concerns about iPhone sales, combined with Apple briefly losing its top market cap position to Nvidia, create significant downward pressure. However, Wedbush's optimistic outlook, driven by Apple's AI strategy and a high price target, offers a strong counterargument. The 'Outperform' rating suggests confidence in Apple's long-term potential. Taking into account of previous rounds of prediction, there is an obvious trend that the estimates are going to be pessimistic with some rebound. Therefore, even though there are more mixed signals, I would still predict a drop, but with a less probability compared with previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple, despite previous significant divestment, and highlights Apple's AI initiatives.  While this is positive, the news is not overwhelmingly bullish. Buffett's reduced stake suggests some caution.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from strongly bullish to slightly bearish.  The overall sentiment surrounding Apple's stock is currently uncertain due to conflicting reports on iPhone sales and overall market sentiment. The AI angle is positive, but it's not a game changer on its own considering existing market concerns. Therefore, I'm assigning a moderate probability to both price increases and decreases, leaning slightly towards a rise given the continued presence in Buffett's significant portfolio and Apple's ongoing AI advancements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued challenges to Apple's App Store policies, which could threaten Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal, as Epic's store is still in its early stages and none of the top 100 mobile game developers have joined yet. The legal and competitive pressures are not new, and Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's stock performance. On the negative side, Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating due to expectations of weak iPhone sales (17, 18, and SE 4) and potentially disappointing Q1 results and guidance. Additionally, Apple's stock has declined more than 8% YTD, and the company has lost its position as the world's most valuable company to Nvidia. However, Wedbush analysts maintain an 'Outperform' rating with a high price target of $325, believing that concerns are overdone and expressing optimism about Apple's AI strategy and its potential for a 'renaissance' in growth. Given these contrasting views, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling, but with a significant degree of uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is part of its ongoing dispute with Apple and Google over app-store fees. This development may be seen as a negative for Apple, as it potentially threatens the company's revenue stream from its App Store. However, considering the previous predictions and analyses, there is a mixed picture for Apple's stock price movement. Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to overall positive sentiment and investments in AI, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and the ongoing dispute with Epic Games. Taking into account the trend of others' beliefs and the fact that the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal, the probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline discusses potential innovation concerns related to Apple Inc., as mentioned by Mark Zuckerberg, but emphasizes that these issues should not necessarily affect the company's stock price. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions with differing levels of optimism and concern. There is notable support for the company from Warren Buffett and recent positive developments like investments in AI. However, market concerns such as weaker iPhone sales and competition from rival firms like Epic Games also contribute to mixed sentiments. The overall market and broader economic conditions may also influence stock price movements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The recent news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, particularly in light of the company's strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). This is a positive factor that supports bullish sentiments among investors. While some analysts express concerns regarding weak iPhone sales and Apple's recent loss in market capitalization to Nvidia, the overall sentiment leans towards optimism because of Apple's commitment to AI and its potential growth in the sector. Previous predictions reflected a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments, but many maintained a generally positive view on Apple's future due to Buffett's backing and the AI integration. Thus, I estimate a somewhat greater likelihood of a stock price rise, tempered by some fears of a downturn due to the competing news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales (17, 18, and SE 4) and potentially disappointing Q1 results and guidance, creates downward pressure. The stock being down 8% YTD and briefly losing the position as the world's most valuable company to NVIDIA reinforces this negative sentiment. However, Wedbush maintains an 'Outperform' rating with a significantly higher price target ($325), believing concerns are overblown and expressing optimism about Apple's AI strategy and its potential for a 'renaissance' in growth, especially with the rollout of Apple Intelligence and the selection of an AI partner in China (potentially Baidu). Given these conflicting views and the slight increase in stock price on Wednesday, the probability of a price increase and decrease is relatively balanced, however, Apple's reliance on iPhone sales and increasing market competitition should not be underestimated. Considering the previous rounds, market expectations tend to be relatively stable, so I predict a rising possibility that is slightly smaller than the falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  While the continued significant holding by Warren Buffett is bullish, and the AI initiatives are promising for long-term growth, there are countervailing forces.  Reports of weak iPhone sales and the ongoing legal battles (Epic Games) present near-term headwinds. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models consistently leaning bullish and others bearish.  The most recent round shows increased uncertainty (near 0.5 probability for both rise and fall). Considering the mixed nature of the news and the differing expert opinions, I'm assigning a probability that reflects the overall uncertainty and the subtle upward trend in the most recent predictions.  The AI focus is positive but not overwhelmingly so, given the existing uncertainties.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, which could potentially threaten Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal, as Epic's store is still in its early stages and none of the top 100 mobile game developers have joined yet. The legal and competitive pressures are not new, and Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat. Considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds, with some models leaning towards a slight negative impact and others seeing minimal effect, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a balanced view with a slight edge towards a price fall due to the persistent nature of the dispute.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is part of its ongoing dispute with Apple and Google over app-store fees. While this development may be seen as a negative for Apple, as it potentially threatens the company's revenue stream from its App Store, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat. Considering the trend of others' beliefs and previous predictions, which show a mix of opinions with differing levels of optimism and concern, I assign a moderate probability to both price increases and decreases. However, given the overall sentiment and the fact that Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility, I lean slightly towards a neutral prediction with a slight bias towards a fall due to the potential threat to Apple's revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed signals regarding Apple Inc.'s market performance and future prospects. While there is a focus on innovation concerns raised by Mark Zuckerberg, the overall sentiment is reinforced by continuous significant investments from Warren Buffett, as well as Apple's strategic investments in AI. Other predictions show a range of sentiments, from cautiously optimistic to bearish, but there is a consistent mention of resilience against various challenges including iPhone sales. Considering the latest round, Wedbush maintains strong faith in Apple's potential, particularly through AI, balancing out more pessimistic views. The probability leans towards a moderate rise but with notable risks.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news highlights Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple, particularly affirming its position in the growing AI sector, which generally encourages investor confidence. However, concerns about weak iPhone sales and the company's recent loss in market capitalization to Nvidia create headwinds for a sustained upward price movement. Mixed sentiments from analysts indicate a cautious but balanced outlook, with some supporting growth due to AI innovations while others express apprehension over sales performance. Historical support from Buffett bolsters a generally positive view despite recent divestments, leading to a moderate but optimistic prediction of a stock price rise opportunity. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect these mixed dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade due to weak iPhone sales projections (17, 18, and SE 4) and potentially disappointing Q1 results and guidance represent a significant bearish signal. This is further substantiated by the stock's 8% year-to-date decline and the brief loss of its position as the world's most valuable company to Nvidia. However, Wedbush's 'Outperform' rating and $325 price target, driven by optimism about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for a growth 'renaissance' with the rollout of Apple Intelligence and a strategic AI partnership in China (potentially with Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance), provide a strong bullish counterargument. Furthermore, Apple's slight rise on Wednesday suggests at least some short-term stabilization. Weighing these conflicting signals, the iPhone sales concerns and market cap loss slightly outweigh the AI optimism, creating a slightly higher likelihood of a price fall. Taking into account the previous rounds predictions, the sentiment seems to be stabilizing to a neutral ground. Therefore, the estimates will be only modified slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  The continued significant investment from Warren Buffett is a strong bullish signal, highlighting confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, especially considering its AI strategy. This is reinforced by Apple's large and active device base, positioning it well to capitalize on AI's expansion into consumer markets. However, concerns remain.  Reports of weakening iPhone sales and ongoing legal challenges (Epic Games) present significant near-term headwinds.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. While the AI focus is positive, it's not a guaranteed short-term game-changer, given the current market concerns.  The overall sentiment leans slightly towards bullishness due to Buffett's continued investment, but the bearish sentiment surrounding iPhone sales and the Epic Games case cannot be ignored.  Considering all aspects, I slightly favor the probability of a price increase but acknowledge the substantial degree of uncertainty inherent in the current market situation. The analysis of previous predictions reveals a trend toward more balanced probabilities with the bullish sentiment still prevalent.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is part of its ongoing dispute with Apple over app-store fees. This could potentially threaten Apple's revenue stream from its App Store, but the immediate financial impact is likely minimal as Epic's store is still in its early stages and none of the top 100 mobile game developers have joined yet. The legal and competitive pressures are not new, and Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat.
