(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI technology in upcoming products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both Buffett's investment decisions and Apple's strategic investments in AI could lead to an upward movement in Apple\u2019s stock price. However, fluctuations and profit-taking may still occur in the short term. Thus, while the probability of a price rise is high, there is also some risk of a minor pullback, especially in reaction to broader market trends.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, the stock is down 8% YTD, and Jefferies downgraded the stock due to concerns about weak iPhone sales (17, 18, and SE 4) and potentially disappointing Q1 results and guidance. The news also mentions Apple losing its position as world's most valuable company to Nvidia. However, Wedbush maintains an \"Outperform\" rating with a significantly higher price target ($325). They believe concerns are overblown, see manageable unit declines in China, and are optimistic about Apple's AI strategy, particularly the selection of an AI partner in China (Baidu, Tencent, ByteDance considered). Wedbush views 2025 as a 'fork in the road' year, indicating potential for significant change, both positive and negative. The slightly positive movement of 0.25% on Wednesday suggests a tentative rebound or stabilization. Considering both the bearish and bullish views, the negative aspects initially seem to carry more weight due to the downgrade and stock decline, however, Wedbush's counterargument regarding AI 'renaissance' and high price target offer a strong bullish perspective that could sway investor sentiment, even if success will be gradual. The overall market sentiment could also play a role. Given that the situation is contradictory, the probabilities are adjusted accordingly while taking into account the more negative initial news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant investment in Apple (AAPL), representing 22.7% of their portfolio.  While the article mentions Buffett's past selling of some Apple stock,  it emphasizes Apple's strategic investments in AI, particularly the Apple Intelligence software and its integration with existing Apple devices (over 2.2 billion active devices). This positions Apple to potentially benefit from the growth of the AI market as a major distributor of AI to consumers. The article's focus on AI's positive impact on other companies in Berkshire's portfolio further reinforces the potential for AI-driven growth in Apple. However, the fact that Buffett already sold a large portion of his Apple holdings suggests some level of caution, and there's no guarantee of continued growth.  Therefore, while the news is generally positive, it's not overwhelmingly so, leading to a moderate probability of price increase and a low probability of a decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, which could potentially threaten Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal, as Epic's store is still in its early stages and none of the top 100 mobile game developers have joined yet. The legal and competitive pressures are not new, and Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is part of its ongoing dispute with Apple and Google over app-store fees. This development may be seen as a negative for Apple, as it potentially threatens the company's revenue stream from its App Store. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited, as the company has a diverse range of revenue streams and a strong brand. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple has already made some concessions, such as opening up its App Store to outside payment options, which may mitigate the negative impact. Overall, the news is likely to have a small negative impact on Apple's stock price, but the probability of a significant decline is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests that despite concerns about a lack of innovation at Apple Inc., as pointed out by Mark Zuckerberg, investors should not be overly concerned. The article provides context as to why innovation issues may not have a significant impact on the company's stock performance. This positive framing might reassure current and potential investors, potentially stabilizing or even slightly increasing the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news emphasizes Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, positioning the company well within the growing AI sector. While there are some concerns regarding iPhone sales and market competition, the overall sentiment is positive due to Apple's strategic focus on AI and its established ecosystem of active devices. The historical performance and ongoing innovations further support potential stock price gains. Given the mixed signals from other analyses, I estimate a higher likelihood of price rise, but accept a reasonable risk of price decline due to the current market dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade and concerns about iPhone sales, combined with Apple briefly losing its top market cap position to Nvidia, create significant downward pressure. However, Wedbush's optimistic outlook, driven by Apple's AI strategy and a high price target, offers a strong counterargument. The 'Outperform' rating suggests confidence in Apple's long-term potential. Taking into account of previous rounds of prediction, there is an obvious trend that the estimates are going to be pessimistic with some rebound. Therefore, even though there are more mixed signals, I would still predict a drop, but with a less probability compared with previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple, despite previous significant divestment, and highlights Apple's AI initiatives.  While this is positive, the news is not overwhelmingly bullish. Buffett's reduced stake suggests some caution.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from strongly bullish to slightly bearish.  The overall sentiment surrounding Apple's stock is currently uncertain due to conflicting reports on iPhone sales and overall market sentiment. The AI angle is positive, but it's not a game changer on its own considering existing market concerns. Therefore, I'm assigning a moderate probability to both price increases and decreases, leaning slightly towards a rise given the continued presence in Buffett's significant portfolio and Apple's ongoing AI advancements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued challenges to Apple's App Store policies, which could threaten Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal, as Epic's store is still in its early stages and none of the top 100 mobile game developers have joined yet. The legal and competitive pressures are not new, and Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's stock performance. On the negative side, Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating due to expectations of weak iPhone sales (17, 18, and SE 4) and potentially disappointing Q1 results and guidance. Additionally, Apple's stock has declined more than 8% YTD, and the company has lost its position as the world's most valuable company to Nvidia. However, Wedbush analysts maintain an 'Outperform' rating with a high price target of $325, believing that concerns are overdone and expressing optimism about Apple's AI strategy and its potential for a 'renaissance' in growth. Given these contrasting views, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling, but with a significant degree of uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is part of its ongoing dispute with Apple and Google over app-store fees. This development may be seen as a negative for Apple, as it potentially threatens the company's revenue stream from its App Store. However, considering the previous predictions and analyses, there is a mixed picture for Apple's stock price movement. Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to overall positive sentiment and investments in AI, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and the ongoing dispute with Epic Games. Taking into account the trend of others' beliefs and the fact that the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal, the probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline discusses potential innovation concerns related to Apple Inc., as mentioned by Mark Zuckerberg, but emphasizes that these issues should not necessarily affect the company's stock price. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions with differing levels of optimism and concern. There is notable support for the company from Warren Buffett and recent positive developments like investments in AI. However, market concerns such as weaker iPhone sales and competition from rival firms like Epic Games also contribute to mixed sentiments. The overall market and broader economic conditions may also influence stock price movements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The recent news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, particularly in light of the company's strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). This is a positive factor that supports bullish sentiments among investors. While some analysts express concerns regarding weak iPhone sales and Apple's recent loss in market capitalization to Nvidia, the overall sentiment leans towards optimism because of Apple's commitment to AI and its potential growth in the sector. Previous predictions reflected a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments, but many maintained a generally positive view on Apple's future due to Buffett's backing and the AI integration. Thus, I estimate a somewhat greater likelihood of a stock price rise, tempered by some fears of a downturn due to the competing news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales (17, 18, and SE 4) and potentially disappointing Q1 results and guidance, creates downward pressure. The stock being down 8% YTD and briefly losing the position as the world's most valuable company to NVIDIA reinforces this negative sentiment. However, Wedbush maintains an 'Outperform' rating with a significantly higher price target ($325), believing concerns are overblown and expressing optimism about Apple's AI strategy and its potential for a 'renaissance' in growth, especially with the rollout of Apple Intelligence and the selection of an AI partner in China (potentially Baidu). Given these conflicting views and the slight increase in stock price on Wednesday, the probability of a price increase and decrease is relatively balanced, however, Apple's reliance on iPhone sales and increasing market competitition should not be underestimated. Considering the previous rounds, market expectations tend to be relatively stable, so I predict a rising possibility that is slightly smaller than the falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  While the continued significant holding by Warren Buffett is bullish, and the AI initiatives are promising for long-term growth, there are countervailing forces.  Reports of weak iPhone sales and the ongoing legal battles (Epic Games) present near-term headwinds. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models consistently leaning bullish and others bearish.  The most recent round shows increased uncertainty (near 0.5 probability for both rise and fall). Considering the mixed nature of the news and the differing expert opinions, I'm assigning a probability that reflects the overall uncertainty and the subtle upward trend in the most recent predictions.  The AI focus is positive but not overwhelmingly so, given the existing uncertainties.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, which could potentially threaten Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal, as Epic's store is still in its early stages and none of the top 100 mobile game developers have joined yet. The legal and competitive pressures are not new, and Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat. Considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds, with some models leaning towards a slight negative impact and others seeing minimal effect, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a balanced view with a slight edge towards a price fall due to the persistent nature of the dispute.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is part of its ongoing dispute with Apple and Google over app-store fees. While this development may be seen as a negative for Apple, as it potentially threatens the company's revenue stream from its App Store, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal. The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat. Considering the trend of others' beliefs and previous predictions, which show a mix of opinions with differing levels of optimism and concern, I assign a moderate probability to both price increases and decreases. However, given the overall sentiment and the fact that Apple has previously managed such challenges without significant stock price volatility, I lean slightly towards a neutral prediction with a slight bias towards a fall due to the potential threat to Apple's revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed signals regarding Apple Inc.'s market performance and future prospects. While there is a focus on innovation concerns raised by Mark Zuckerberg, the overall sentiment is reinforced by continuous significant investments from Warren Buffett, as well as Apple's strategic investments in AI. Other predictions show a range of sentiments, from cautiously optimistic to bearish, but there is a consistent mention of resilience against various challenges including iPhone sales. Considering the latest round, Wedbush maintains strong faith in Apple's potential, particularly through AI, balancing out more pessimistic views. The probability leans towards a moderate rise but with notable risks.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news highlights Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple, particularly affirming its position in the growing AI sector, which generally encourages investor confidence. However, concerns about weak iPhone sales and the company's recent loss in market capitalization to Nvidia create headwinds for a sustained upward price movement. Mixed sentiments from analysts indicate a cautious but balanced outlook, with some supporting growth due to AI innovations while others express apprehension over sales performance. Historical support from Buffett bolsters a generally positive view despite recent divestments, leading to a moderate but optimistic prediction of a stock price rise opportunity. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect these mixed dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade due to weak iPhone sales projections (17, 18, and SE 4) and potentially disappointing Q1 results and guidance represent a significant bearish signal. This is further substantiated by the stock's 8% year-to-date decline and the brief loss of its position as the world's most valuable company to Nvidia. However, Wedbush's 'Outperform' rating and $325 price target, driven by optimism about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for a growth 'renaissance' with the rollout of Apple Intelligence and a strategic AI partnership in China (potentially with Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance), provide a strong bullish counterargument. Furthermore, Apple's slight rise on Wednesday suggests at least some short-term stabilization. Weighing these conflicting signals, the iPhone sales concerns and market cap loss slightly outweigh the AI optimism, creating a slightly higher likelihood of a price fall. Taking into account the previous rounds predictions, the sentiment seems to be stabilizing to a neutral ground. Therefore, the estimates will be only modified slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  The continued significant investment from Warren Buffett is a strong bullish signal, highlighting confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, especially considering its AI strategy. This is reinforced by Apple's large and active device base, positioning it well to capitalize on AI's expansion into consumer markets. However, concerns remain.  Reports of weakening iPhone sales and ongoing legal challenges (Epic Games) present significant near-term headwinds.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. While the AI focus is positive, it's not a guaranteed short-term game-changer, given the current market concerns.  The overall sentiment leans slightly towards bullishness due to Buffett's continued investment, but the bearish sentiment surrounding iPhone sales and the Epic Games case cannot be ignored.  Considering all aspects, I slightly favor the probability of a price increase but acknowledge the substantial degree of uncertainty inherent in the current market situation. The analysis of previous predictions reveals a trend toward more balanced probabilities with the bullish sentiment still prevalent.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is part of its ongoing dispute with Apple over app-store fees. This could potentially threaten Apple's revenue stream from its App Store, but the immediate financial impact is likely minimal as Epic's store is still in its early stages and none of the top 100 mobile game developers have joined yet.

The market may view this as a continuation of an ongoing issue rather than a new threat.
