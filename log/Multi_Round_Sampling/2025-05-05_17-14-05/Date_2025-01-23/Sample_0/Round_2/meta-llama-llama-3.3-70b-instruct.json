(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI advancements in its products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both AI developments and Buffett's endorsement is likely to bolster demand for Apple stock. Additionally, Apple is well-positioned in the AI space with its user base and technological innovations, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise. However, the mention of previous profit-taking by Buffett could introduce some cautious sentiments, preventing a strong surge. Therefore, while the outlook is generally positive, there's a measured risk of slight volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline is highly generic and clickbait-oriented. It doesn't provide any concrete information about Apple or its performance. The phrase \"Could This Bull Market Buy\" is vague and could apply to numerous companies. The lack of specific information and reliance on hyperbole suggests the article likely contains speculative content and is unlikely to significantly impact investor sentiment or the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are close to even, with a *slight* bias towards a neutral outcome due to the generic nature of the headline which gives investors very little to react to.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline presents a contrasting viewpoint: Zuckerberg's assertion of Apple's lack of innovation versus the article's argument that this shouldn't affect investors.  The article likely provides counterarguments, such as strong brand loyalty, robust existing product lines generating consistent revenue, and potential for future innovations that haven't been publicly revealed, thus mitigating the impact of Zuckerberg's criticism.  While the criticism is potentially negative, the counterarguments presented in the article suggest the market may largely discount it. Therefore, a moderate positive or neutral reaction is more likely than a significant negative one.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the mitigating arguments presented in the article, but the overall impact is expected to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and specifically mentions Apple as 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the one-month return of AAPL was -13.59%, indicating recent underperformance. On the other hand, Apple's 52-week return of +15.28% and its position as the 8th most popular stock among hedge funds suggest underlying strength. However, the tone of the news leans more towards caution due to valuation concerns and shifting investor interest towards AI stocks. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that the Indian government is urging Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores. Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant to comply, with Google seemingly resisting more strongly. The Indian government may use legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. Historically, Apple has complied with similar regulations in other countries, such as Russia. The news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it suggests potential regulatory risks but also a precedent for compliance. However, the impact is likely limited as it pertains to a specific geographic region and a specific regulatory demand.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is ramping up its fight against Apple and Google over app-store fees. Epic Games is adding third-party game titles to its mobile marketplace, which could potentially threaten Apple's app store revenue. However, Apple has a strong track record of defending its app store fees, and a federal appeals court recently ruled mostly in favor of Apple. The news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the potential disruption to its app store revenue, but the probability of a significant decline is low due to Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns related to China orders and AI innovations, suggesting current headwinds in the market. Given Cramer's credibility and historical accuracy in calling out such predictions, the market may react negatively to these statements, potentially leading to a decline in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, affirming investor confidence in the company amidst the rising importance of AI in various industries. While there are mentions of previous profit-taking by Buffett, the overall sentiment is positive, reflecting optimism about Apple's AI advancements and future growth potential. The probabilities from previous rounds suggest a range of investor sentiment, indicating varied opinions. However, given the strong backing from Buffett and Apple's continuous innovation in AI, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than that of a fall, albeit with some caution due to market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline is very generic and clickbaity, but also implies a positive outlook for Apple stock. The previous predictions are all over the place, indicating a lack of consensus and suggesting minimal impact from the news itself. However, the round 0 models leaned slightly towards a negative or neutral impact. Considering the lack of concrete information and the diverse range of past predictions, I will estimate a slightly pessimistic outlook. There's nothing truly compelling to drive the price up, so I'll nudge the probabilities slightly towards a less significant chance of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline presents a somewhat negative perspective on Apple's innovation, citing Mark Zuckerberg's opinion. However, the article itself argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors.  This creates a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Examining the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, highlighting uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term performance. Some models point to positive factors like Warren Buffett's continued investment and Apple's strong market position, while others emphasize concerns about valuation, regulatory risks, and competitive pressures. The significant spread in predictions suggests the market is currently ambivalent, with no clear consensus on whether the news will positively or negatively impact the stock price. Considering the mixed signals and lack of concrete information in the headline, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  While the article tries to downplay Zuckerberg's criticism, it doesn't offer compelling counterarguments that would significantly sway investor sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise and fall is considered relatively equal, slightly favoring a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple remains a significant holding and has shown strong 52-week performance (+15.28%), the recent one-month return is negative (-13.59%), indicating short-term underperformance. Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about Apple's valuation, describing it as 'pretty expensive' and citing 'somewhat disappointing' data. Additionally, the shift in hedge fund holdings (from 184 to 158) suggests reduced confidence. The broader market uncertainty post-election and the focus on AI stocks as more promising investments further dampen the outlook for Apple. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that the Indian government has requested Apple (AAPL) and Google to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores. Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant to comply, with the government potentially using legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. Historically, Apple has complied with similar regulations in other countries, such as Russia. This news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it suggests potential regulatory risks but also a precedent for compliance. However, the impact is likely limited as it pertains to a specific geographic region and a specific regulatory demand. Considering the mixed reactions from various models in previous rounds, with predictions ranging from a high of 0.75 to a low of 0.2 for a stock price rise, the overall sentiment seems cautious. Given this context, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to potential regulatory risks and compliance issues.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' intensified battle against Apple and Google over app-store fees, with Epic adding third-party game titles to its mobile marketplace. This move could potentially disrupt Apple's app store revenue. However, considering Apple's strong track record of defending its app store fees and its diversified revenue streams, the overall impact on Apple's stock price might be limited. The previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, but most lean towards a cautious or slightly negative outlook due to regulatory risks or competition. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than that of falling, as the news introduces a level of uncertainty and potential revenue disruption for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Jim Cramer predicts Apple will miss earnings expectations, citing concerns over China orders and AI innovations. Cramer's credibility and history of accurate predictions add weight to his stance. Additionally, the previous round of predictions shows a general downward trend, reinforcing concerns about the stock price. Several models predict a decline, suggesting prevailing negative sentiment. This combination of explicit negative predictions and general downward trends indicates a higher probability of stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
