(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI advancements in its products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both AI developments and Buffett's endorsement is likely to bolster demand for Apple stock. Additionally, Apple is well-positioned in the AI space with its user base and technological innovations, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise. However, the mention of previous profit-taking by Buffett could introduce some cautious sentiments, preventing a strong surge. Therefore, while the outlook is generally positive, there's a measured risk of slight volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline is highly generic and clickbait-oriented. It doesn't provide any concrete information about Apple or its performance. The phrase \"Could This Bull Market Buy\" is vague and could apply to numerous companies. The lack of specific information and reliance on hyperbole suggests the article likely contains speculative content and is unlikely to significantly impact investor sentiment or the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are close to even, with a *slight* bias towards a neutral outcome due to the generic nature of the headline which gives investors very little to react to.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline presents a contrasting viewpoint: Zuckerberg's assertion of Apple's lack of innovation versus the article's argument that this shouldn't affect investors.  The article likely provides counterarguments, such as strong brand loyalty, robust existing product lines generating consistent revenue, and potential for future innovations that haven't been publicly revealed, thus mitigating the impact of Zuckerberg's criticism.  While the criticism is potentially negative, the counterarguments presented in the article suggest the market may largely discount it. Therefore, a moderate positive or neutral reaction is more likely than a significant negative one.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the mitigating arguments presented in the article, but the overall impact is expected to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and specifically mentions Apple as 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the one-month return of AAPL was -13.59%, indicating recent underperformance. On the other hand, Apple's 52-week return of +15.28% and its position as the 8th most popular stock among hedge funds suggest underlying strength. However, the tone of the news leans more towards caution due to valuation concerns and shifting investor interest towards AI stocks. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that the Indian government is urging Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores. Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant to comply, with Google seemingly resisting more strongly. The Indian government may use legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. Historically, Apple has complied with similar regulations in other countries, such as Russia. The news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it suggests potential regulatory risks but also a precedent for compliance. However, the impact is likely limited as it pertains to a specific geographic region and a specific regulatory demand.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is ramping up its fight against Apple and Google over app-store fees. Epic Games is adding third-party game titles to its mobile marketplace, which could potentially threaten Apple's app store revenue. However, Apple has a strong track record of defending its app store fees, and a federal appeals court recently ruled mostly in favor of Apple. The news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the potential disruption to its app store revenue, but the probability of a significant decline is low due to Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns related to China orders and AI innovations, suggesting current headwinds in the market. Given Cramer's credibility and historical accuracy in calling out such predictions, the market may react negatively to these statements, potentially leading to a decline in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, affirming investor confidence in the company amidst the rising importance of AI in various industries. While there are mentions of previous profit-taking by Buffett, the overall sentiment is positive, reflecting optimism about Apple's AI advancements and future growth potential. The probabilities from previous rounds suggest a range of investor sentiment, indicating varied opinions. However, given the strong backing from Buffett and Apple's continuous innovation in AI, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than that of a fall, albeit with some caution due to market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline is very generic and clickbaity, but also implies a positive outlook for Apple stock. The previous predictions are all over the place, indicating a lack of consensus and suggesting minimal impact from the news itself. However, the round 0 models leaned slightly towards a negative or neutral impact. Considering the lack of concrete information and the diverse range of past predictions, I will estimate a slightly pessimistic outlook. There's nothing truly compelling to drive the price up, so I'll nudge the probabilities slightly towards a less significant chance of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline presents a somewhat negative perspective on Apple's innovation, citing Mark Zuckerberg's opinion. However, the article itself argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors.  This creates a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Examining the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, highlighting uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term performance. Some models point to positive factors like Warren Buffett's continued investment and Apple's strong market position, while others emphasize concerns about valuation, regulatory risks, and competitive pressures. The significant spread in predictions suggests the market is currently ambivalent, with no clear consensus on whether the news will positively or negatively impact the stock price. Considering the mixed signals and lack of concrete information in the headline, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  While the article tries to downplay Zuckerberg's criticism, it doesn't offer compelling counterarguments that would significantly sway investor sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise and fall is considered relatively equal, slightly favoring a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple remains a significant holding and has shown strong 52-week performance (+15.28%), the recent one-month return is negative (-13.59%), indicating short-term underperformance. Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about Apple's valuation, describing it as 'pretty expensive' and citing 'somewhat disappointing' data. Additionally, the shift in hedge fund holdings (from 184 to 158) suggests reduced confidence. The broader market uncertainty post-election and the focus on AI stocks as more promising investments further dampen the outlook for Apple. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that the Indian government has requested Apple (AAPL) and Google to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores. Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant to comply, with the government potentially using legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. Historically, Apple has complied with similar regulations in other countries, such as Russia. This news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it suggests potential regulatory risks but also a precedent for compliance. However, the impact is likely limited as it pertains to a specific geographic region and a specific regulatory demand. Considering the mixed reactions from various models in previous rounds, with predictions ranging from a high of 0.75 to a low of 0.2 for a stock price rise, the overall sentiment seems cautious. Given this context, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to potential regulatory risks and compliance issues.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' intensified battle against Apple and Google over app-store fees, with Epic adding third-party game titles to its mobile marketplace. This move could potentially disrupt Apple's app store revenue. However, considering Apple's strong track record of defending its app store fees and its diversified revenue streams, the overall impact on Apple's stock price might be limited. The previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, but most lean towards a cautious or slightly negative outlook due to regulatory risks or competition. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than that of falling, as the news introduces a level of uncertainty and potential revenue disruption for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Jim Cramer predicts Apple will miss earnings expectations, citing concerns over China orders and AI innovations. Cramer's credibility and history of accurate predictions add weight to his stance. Additionally, the previous round of predictions shows a general downward trend, reinforcing concerns about the stock price. Several models predict a decline, suggesting prevailing negative sentiment. This combination of explicit negative predictions and general downward trends indicates a higher probability of stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple and its focus on artificial intelligence, which supports a positive view of the company's future potential. Many models reflect varying degrees of optimism, with previous rounds indicating a mixture of sentiment but leaning generally more positively due to AI developments. While some caution exists due to profit-taking and mixed short-term performances, the overarching sentiment around Apple's innovation and Buffett's endorsement suggests a higher likelihood of stock price rise than fall. The probabilities reflect a consensus that leans towards a more positive outlook amidst the general market uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline is a generic, clickbait title promising wealth but lacking specific information about Apple. Previous predictions show a wide range of sentiments, indicating high uncertainty and minimal direct impact from the headlines themselves. Round 0 models leaned slightly to the negative side with round 1 more divergent. Considering the absence of concrete details in the headline and the mixed but generally neutral-to-slightly-negative sentiment shown in the past analyses, I predict the price will be more likely to fall. However, given Apple's inherent stability and resilience, a significant fall is unlikely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline presents a seemingly negative viewpoint on Apple's innovation, but the article itself argues this shouldn't affect investors.  This creates a neutral to slightly positive outlook, at least from the provided headline and summary. However, the previous predictions show significant divergence, ranging from a 75% chance of a rise to an 80% chance of a fall. This wide range suggests a lack of consensus and limited market reaction to the news itself.  The diverse opinions are tied to other news factors across prior rounds affecting the models' outputs including Buffett's trades, regulatory concerns (India, app store fees), and earnings predictions. The article's attempt to downplay the Zuckerberg criticism is not a strong enough counterargument to overcome the mixed sentiment from the other news items. Considering the lack of concrete information in the provided headline and the inconsistent previous predictions, I lean towards a slightly pessimistic view reflecting the overall trend toward negative predictions in the previous round. The probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall, reflecting the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple remains a significant holding and has shown strong 52-week performance (+15.28%), the recent one-month return is negative (-13.59%), indicating short-term underperformance.

Cramer's credibility and history of accurate predictions add weight to his stance. Additionally, previous rounds of predictions from various models show a consistent trend of declining probabilities for stock price rises and increasing probabilities for declines. While there are some bullish sentiments and support from influential investors like Warren Buffett, the overall tone of the news and the majority historical predictions strongly suggest a negative outlook for the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
