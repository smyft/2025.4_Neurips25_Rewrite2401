(AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, \u201cI think that, regardless, it\u2019s a very pro-business regime.\u201d He explained that his view came despite \u201ca story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].\u201d According to Cramer, the story \u201cis the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it\u2019s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump\u2019s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President\u2019s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. \u201cWell look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down \u2019cause he\u2019s going to get us to pump more,\u201d Cramer outlined. \u201cAnd I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that\u2019s front and center,\u201d he added. However, Cramer cautioned that \u201c[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they\u2019re being told, drill. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll respond to that. I just don\u2019t think that they will.\u201d\n\nContinuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs \u201cmore pipe[line], we\u2019re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.\u201d He outlined that President Trump \u201cbasically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.\u201d Cramer believes that the move was necessary \u201c[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don\u2019t have a lot of what\u2019s known as trains. We don\u2019t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can\u2019t ship more, as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of, facilities. And we don\u2019t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. \u201cSo far China kind of got off the hook,\u201d he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, \u201c[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we\u2019re going to put some guys in. They\u2019re going to make a difference. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it\u2019s the deep state. But you know what I\u2019m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government\u2019s operations. \u201cIt could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he shared.\n\nHe also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. \u201cWhen the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,\u201d Cramer shared. According to him, \u201c[h]e [Biden] wasn\u2019t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn\u2019t like em. He didn\u2019t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That\u2019s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!\u201d\n\nShifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok\u2019s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, \u201c[t]hey handed down, the only time I\u2019ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.\u201d He added according to the court\u2019s opinion, it was clear that \u201cthere is a huge national security risk.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, \u201cRight, but I\u2019m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.\u201d Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, \u201c[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.\u201d\n\nHe also commented on whether there\u2019s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. \u201cThere is! The Supreme Court says it\u2019s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it\u2019s a front door,\u201d Cramer believes. He added, \u201cI think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn\u2019t use that term, but he meant it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(see more details here).Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation - Here's Why\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nConsumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that\u2019s regularly on Cramer\u2019s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs\u2019 death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s gonna miss big. I mean I can\u2019t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven\u2019t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter\u2019s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It\u2019s really. . . .I mean AI\u2019s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how\u2019s Apple gonna do. And they\u2019re gonna say it. They\u2019re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it\u2019s not a surprise! Okay. They\u2019re acting like it\u2019s, they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s the Commanders.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI advancements in its products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both AI developments and Buffett's endorsement is likely to bolster demand for Apple stock. Additionally, Apple is well-positioned in the AI space with its user base and technological innovations, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise. However, the mention of previous profit-taking by Buffett could introduce some cautious sentiments, preventing a strong surge. Therefore, while the outlook is generally positive, there's a measured risk of slight volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline is highly generic and clickbait-oriented. It doesn't provide any concrete information about Apple or its performance. The phrase \"Could This Bull Market Buy\" is vague and could apply to numerous companies. The lack of specific information and reliance on hyperbole suggests the article likely contains speculative content and is unlikely to significantly impact investor sentiment or the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are close to even, with a *slight* bias towards a neutral outcome due to the generic nature of the headline which gives investors very little to react to.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline presents a contrasting viewpoint: Zuckerberg's assertion of Apple's lack of innovation versus the article's argument that this shouldn't affect investors.  The article likely provides counterarguments, such as strong brand loyalty, robust existing product lines generating consistent revenue, and potential for future innovations that haven't been publicly revealed, thus mitigating the impact of Zuckerberg's criticism.  While the criticism is potentially negative, the counterarguments presented in the article suggest the market may largely discount it. Therefore, a moderate positive or neutral reaction is more likely than a significant negative one.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the mitigating arguments presented in the article, but the overall impact is expected to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and specifically mentions Apple as 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the one-month return of AAPL was -13.59%, indicating recent underperformance. On the other hand, Apple's 52-week return of +15.28% and its position as the 8th most popular stock among hedge funds suggest underlying strength. However, the tone of the news leans more towards caution due to valuation concerns and shifting investor interest towards AI stocks. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that the Indian government is urging Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores. Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant to comply, with Google seemingly resisting more strongly. The Indian government may use legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. Historically, Apple has complied with similar regulations in other countries, such as Russia. The news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it suggests potential regulatory risks but also a precedent for compliance. However, the impact is likely limited as it pertains to a specific geographic region and a specific regulatory demand.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is ramping up its fight against Apple and Google over app-store fees. Epic Games is adding third-party game titles to its mobile marketplace, which could potentially threaten Apple's app store revenue. However, Apple has a strong track record of defending its app store fees, and a federal appeals court recently ruled mostly in favor of Apple. The news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the potential disruption to its app store revenue, but the probability of a significant decline is low due to Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns related to China orders and AI innovations, suggesting current headwinds in the market. Given Cramer's credibility and historical accuracy in calling out such predictions, the market may react negatively to these statements, potentially leading to a decline in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, affirming investor confidence in the company amidst the rising importance of AI in various industries. While there are mentions of previous profit-taking by Buffett, the overall sentiment is positive, reflecting optimism about Apple's AI advancements and future growth potential. The probabilities from previous rounds suggest a range of investor sentiment, indicating varied opinions. However, given the strong backing from Buffett and Apple's continuous innovation in AI, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than that of a fall, albeit with some caution due to market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline is very generic and clickbaity, but also implies a positive outlook for Apple stock. The previous predictions are all over the place, indicating a lack of consensus and suggesting minimal impact from the news itself. However, the round 0 models leaned slightly towards a negative or neutral impact. Considering the lack of concrete information and the diverse range of past predictions, I will estimate a slightly pessimistic outlook. There's nothing truly compelling to drive the price up, so I'll nudge the probabilities slightly towards a less significant chance of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline presents a somewhat negative perspective on Apple's innovation, citing Mark Zuckerberg's opinion. However, the article itself argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors.  This creates a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Examining the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, highlighting uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term performance. Some models point to positive factors like Warren Buffett's continued investment and Apple's strong market position, while others emphasize concerns about valuation, regulatory risks, and competitive pressures. The significant spread in predictions suggests the market is currently ambivalent, with no clear consensus on whether the news will positively or negatively impact the stock price. Considering the mixed signals and lack of concrete information in the headline, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  While the article tries to downplay Zuckerberg's criticism, it doesn't offer compelling counterarguments that would significantly sway investor sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise and fall is considered relatively equal, slightly favoring a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple remains a significant holding and has shown strong 52-week performance (+15.28%), the recent one-month return is negative (-13.59%), indicating short-term underperformance. Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about Apple's valuation, describing it as 'pretty expensive' and citing 'somewhat disappointing' data. Additionally, the shift in hedge fund holdings (from 184 to 158) suggests reduced confidence. The broader market uncertainty post-election and the focus on AI stocks as more promising investments further dampen the outlook for Apple. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that the Indian government has requested Apple (AAPL) and Google to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores. Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant to comply, with the government potentially using legal actions or policy directives to enforce compliance. Historically, Apple has complied with similar regulations in other countries, such as Russia. This news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it suggests potential regulatory risks but also a precedent for compliance. However, the impact is likely limited as it pertains to a specific geographic region and a specific regulatory demand. Considering the mixed reactions from various models in previous rounds, with predictions ranging from a high of 0.75 to a low of 0.2 for a stock price rise, the overall sentiment seems cautious. Given this context, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to potential regulatory risks and compliance issues.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' intensified battle against Apple and Google over app-store fees, with Epic adding third-party game titles to its mobile marketplace. This move could potentially disrupt Apple's app store revenue. However, considering Apple's strong track record of defending its app store fees and its diversified revenue streams, the overall impact on Apple's stock price might be limited. The previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, but most lean towards a cautious or slightly negative outlook due to regulatory risks or competition. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than that of falling, as the news introduces a level of uncertainty and potential revenue disruption for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Jim Cramer predicts Apple will miss earnings expectations, citing concerns over China orders and AI innovations. Cramer's credibility and history of accurate predictions add weight to his stance. Additionally, the previous round of predictions shows a general downward trend, reinforcing concerns about the stock price. Several models predict a decline, suggesting prevailing negative sentiment. This combination of explicit negative predictions and general downward trends indicates a higher probability of stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple and its focus on artificial intelligence, which supports a positive view of the company's future potential. Many models reflect varying degrees of optimism, with previous rounds indicating a mixture of sentiment but leaning generally more positively due to AI developments. While some caution exists due to profit-taking and mixed short-term performances, the overarching sentiment around Apple's innovation and Buffett's endorsement suggests a higher likelihood of stock price rise than fall. The probabilities reflect a consensus that leans towards a more positive outlook amidst the general market uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline is a generic, clickbait title promising wealth but lacking specific information about Apple. Previous predictions show a wide range of sentiments, indicating high uncertainty and minimal direct impact from the headlines themselves. Round 0 models leaned slightly to the negative side with round 1 more divergent. Considering the absence of concrete details in the headline and the mixed but generally neutral-to-slightly-negative sentiment shown in the past analyses, I predict the price will be more likely to fall. However, given Apple's inherent stability and resilience, a significant fall is unlikely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline presents a seemingly negative viewpoint on Apple's innovation, but the article itself argues this shouldn't affect investors.  This creates a neutral to slightly positive outlook, at least from the provided headline and summary. However, the previous predictions show significant divergence, ranging from a 75% chance of a rise to an 80% chance of a fall. This wide range suggests a lack of consensus and limited market reaction to the news itself.  The diverse opinions are tied to other news factors across prior rounds affecting the models' outputs including Buffett's trades, regulatory concerns (India, app store fees), and earnings predictions. The article's attempt to downplay the Zuckerberg criticism is not a strong enough counterargument to overcome the mixed sentiment from the other news items. Considering the lack of concrete information in the provided headline and the inconsistent previous predictions, I lean towards a slightly pessimistic view reflecting the overall trend toward negative predictions in the previous round. The probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall, reflecting the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple remains a significant holding and has shown strong 52-week performance (+15.28%), the recent one-month return is negative (-13.59%), indicating short-term underperformance.

Cramer's credibility and history of accurate predictions add weight to his stance. Additionally, previous rounds of predictions from various models show a consistent trend of declining probabilities for stock price rises and increasing probabilities for declines. While there are some bullish sentiments and support from influential investors like Warren Buffett, the overall tone of the news and the majority historical predictions strongly suggest a negative outlook for the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
