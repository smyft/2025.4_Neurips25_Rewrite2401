(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple and Google regarding app store fees and mobile game distribution. While this could lead to potential long-term challenges for Apple if competition increases and developers shift towards alternative marketplaces, the immediate impact of this news is relatively neutral for Apple. The ruling in favor of Apple in recent court cases may reinforce investor confidence. Moreover, Apple's strong financial performance and ability to adapt are likely to help it weather competitive pressures. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced outlook rather than a drastic shift.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Apple already integrates ChatGPT and has Apple Intelligence in Siri, the launch of Perplexity Assistant poses a competitive threat. However, Perplexity is a smaller player, and Apple already has a significant footprint. The news also mentions that Apple might allow Perplexity on iOS, indicating a potential for collaboration or co-existence rather than direct competition. Considering Apple's scale, existing AI capabilities and potential for strategic partnerships, the impact of Perplexity's entry is likely to be minor/neutral. The price could fluctuate in anticipation from traders, but it is not likely to significantly push the stock up or down over the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple, along with other smartphone makers, is facing pressure from India to open up its app store.  This is potentially negative news for Apple as it could lead to reduced control over its app ecosystem and potentially lower revenue from app store fees. However, the impact is uncertain and depends on several factors: the extent to which India's demands are met, the potential economic impact of changes imposed, and Apple's ability to adapt its strategy.  The lack of detail in the available news snippet makes precise prediction difficult. Given the uncertainty and the relatively general nature of the news, it's reasonable to assume that the impact on Apple's stock price will be limited, resulting in only a small probability of a significant rise or fall in the stock price. The probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise owing to the negative potential of reduced control over its app ecosystem. Note that this analysis is based on limited information; a complete article may change this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Mark Zuckerberg's critique of Apple's lack of innovation but suggests that this may not significantly impact investors. This implies that while Apple's innovation might be questioned, its financial performance and investor confidence remain strong. Given Apple's established market position, consistent revenue streams, and investor focus on long-term stability rather than short-term innovation metrics, the stock price is less likely to react negatively to such critiques. However, the mention of innovation concerns could introduce mild uncertainty. Overall, the probability of a rise slightly outweighs the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's continued concern about the overall valuation of the market and specifically notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent downward momentum. However, the firm's conviction in AI stocks over Apple suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook. Given these points, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than it falling, but not drastically so, as the article also mentions Apple's strong 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks and its significant market capitalization.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's presidency. As a result, the stock price of Apple (AAPL) may rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure and fines. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases in the US, which could still pose a risk to the company. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung tapping Google and Qualcomm for the development of the Galaxy S25, positioning it directly against Apple's iPhone 17 Air. This could increase competition for Apple in the smartphone market. While Samsung has included advanced AI features like Google's AI model and voice assistant Bixby, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price seems more negative than positive. However, Apple's iPhone 17 Air also includes significant upgrades with AI features. The market may interpret this news negatively, especially if investors are concerned about increased competition.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple and Google, which may lead to increased pressure on Apple's app store revenue model. While Epic's efforts represent a significant challenge, the immediate impact on Apple's stock may be neutral due to its strong financial fundamentals and previous court victories against Epic. However, the escalating competition could have long-term implications for Apple's revenue from app stores, creating a slight tilt towards bearish sentiment. Considering previous predictions where a slight majority indicated a neutral to downward outlook, I estimate a higher probability of falling stock prices based on this ongoing competitive threat.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Perplexity launching an AI assistant to compete with established players like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. While this signifies increasing competition in the AI assistant space, it's important to consider Apple's existing strengths. Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence into Siri and partnered with OpenAI to include ChatGPT. The news suggests that Perplexity is also aiming to be available on iOS, implying potential collaboration or co-existence rather than a direct confrontation. Given Apple's large user base and established AI capabilities, the potential negative impact from Perplexity's challenge seems limited. However, the increased competition slightly tilts the probability towards a minor downward movement. Previous rounds of predictions were quite varied, displaying both bullish and bearish sentiments based on different news. Considering the trend of those previous predictions, as time goes by, the predictions tend to be more reasonable and consistent with the news content.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding India pressuring Apple and other smartphone makers to open up their app stores presents a mixed bag. On one hand, it suggests potential regulatory challenges and reduced control over the App Store ecosystem, which could negatively impact revenue from app store fees. This aligns with some previous predictions indicating a higher probability of a price fall due to similar regulatory concerns or increased competition.  However, the lack of detail in the headline makes it difficult to gauge the severity of the potential impact.  Apple's size, financial strength, and past ability to navigate regulatory hurdles suggest a resilience that could mitigate the negative impact. The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting market reaction based on limited information. Considering the potential negative impact alongside Apple's overall market position and ability to adapt, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a minor price fall, but the overall impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Mark Zuckerberg's critique of Apple's lack of innovation but suggests that this may not significantly impact investors.

However, the mention of innovation concerns could introduce mild uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, which show a mix of opinions but lean slightly towards a neutral to positive outlook, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's investor letter, which mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of its holdings. The letter expresses concern about the overall market valuation and notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article highlights Apple's recent stock performance, including a -13.59% one-month return and a 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks. The firm's conviction in AI stocks over Apple suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook. Considering these points, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than it falling, but not drastically so, as Apple has a significant market capitalization and strong long-term performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's presidency. As a result, the stock price of Apple (AAPL) may rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure and fines. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases in the US, which could still pose a risk to the company. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which showed a range of opinions but mostly leaned towards a slight positive or neutral outlook for Apple's stock price, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung tapping Google and Qualcomm for the development of the Galaxy S25, positioning it directly against Apple's iPhone 17 Air. Increased competition can often lead to heightened market concerns regarding Apple's future market share and profitability in the smartphone segment. While the article acknowledges advancements in Apple's own AI features with the iPhone 17 Air, it emphasizes Samsung's aggressive strategy to leverage AI and other technologies to rival Apple. Given historical trends of investor reactions to increased competitive pressure, particularly in the tech sector, the announcement could instill a degree of caution among investors, potentially leading to a modest decrease in stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games ramping up competition against Apple by introducing third-party game titles presents a potential threat to Apple's app store revenue model, which relies heavily on the current fee structure. Despite recent court victories that may reinforce investor confidence, the ongoing pressures from competition could pose long-term challenges. Most previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of stock price decline, influenced by concerns over increased competitive pressure and regulatory implications. As a result, I am estimating a higher probability of a stock price fall than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Perplexity launching an AI assistant challenging major players like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and OpenAI's ChatGPT. While this introduces more competition, the impact on Apple is likely to be limited. Apple already integrates Apple Intelligence into Siri and partners with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The fact that Perplexity wants their assistant to be on iOS suggests they recognize Apple's dominance and potentially hope for collaboration rather than a head-on conflict. The previous rounds of predictions don't show a directional conviction and based on the slightly negative trends of the stock value and the nature of the previous predictions, a slight downward movement is expected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding India pressuring Apple to open its app store is potentially negative, as it could reduce Apple's control over its ecosystem and its app store revenue.  However, the impact is uncertain due to the lack of detail in the provided headline.  Apple's size and history of navigating regulatory hurdles suggest resilience.  Analyzing prior predictions reveals a mixed outlook, with probabilities ranging from a slight upward to a slight downward trend, likely reflecting the inherent uncertainty of the situation.  Given the potential for negative impact but also considering Apple's strength and the inconclusive nature of the news, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, acknowledging the limited information available and the inherent volatility of the market. The previous predictions exhibit a lack of strong consensus and a trend towards slightly bearish sentiment in round 1, which I am partially reflecting in my own assessment.  The overall impact is expected to be relatively limited, especially in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Mark Zuckerberg's critique of Apple's lack of innovation but suggests that this may not significantly impact investors.
