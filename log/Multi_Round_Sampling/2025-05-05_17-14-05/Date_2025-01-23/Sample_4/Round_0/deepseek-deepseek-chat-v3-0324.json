This implies that while Apple's innovation might be questioned, its financial performance and investor confidence remain strong. Given Apple's established market position, consistent revenue streams, and investor focus on long-term stability rather than short-term innovation metrics, the stock price is less likely to react negatively to such critiques. However, the mention of innovation concerns could introduce mild uncertainty.
