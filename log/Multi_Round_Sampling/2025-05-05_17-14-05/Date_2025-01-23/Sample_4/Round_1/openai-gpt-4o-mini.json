(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple and Google regarding app store fees and mobile game distribution. While this could lead to potential long-term challenges for Apple if competition increases and developers shift towards alternative marketplaces, the immediate impact of this news is relatively neutral for Apple. The ruling in favor of Apple in recent court cases may reinforce investor confidence. Moreover, Apple's strong financial performance and ability to adapt are likely to help it weather competitive pressures. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced outlook rather than a drastic shift.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Apple already integrates ChatGPT and has Apple Intelligence in Siri, the launch of Perplexity Assistant poses a competitive threat. However, Perplexity is a smaller player, and Apple already has a significant footprint. The news also mentions that Apple might allow Perplexity on iOS, indicating a potential for collaboration or co-existence rather than direct competition. Considering Apple's scale, existing AI capabilities and potential for strategic partnerships, the impact of Perplexity's entry is likely to be minor/neutral. The price could fluctuate in anticipation from traders, but it is not likely to significantly push the stock up or down over the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple, along with other smartphone makers, is facing pressure from India to open up its app store.  This is potentially negative news for Apple as it could lead to reduced control over its app ecosystem and potentially lower revenue from app store fees. However, the impact is uncertain and depends on several factors: the extent to which India's demands are met, the potential economic impact of changes imposed, and Apple's ability to adapt its strategy.  The lack of detail in the available news snippet makes precise prediction difficult. Given the uncertainty and the relatively general nature of the news, it's reasonable to assume that the impact on Apple's stock price will be limited, resulting in only a small probability of a significant rise or fall in the stock price. The probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise owing to the negative potential of reduced control over its app ecosystem. Note that this analysis is based on limited information; a complete article may change this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Mark Zuckerberg's critique of Apple's lack of innovation but suggests that this may not significantly impact investors. This implies that while Apple's innovation might be questioned, its financial performance and investor confidence remain strong. Given Apple's established market position, consistent revenue streams, and investor focus on long-term stability rather than short-term innovation metrics, the stock price is less likely to react negatively to such critiques. However, the mention of innovation concerns could introduce mild uncertainty. Overall, the probability of a rise slightly outweighs the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's continued concern about the overall valuation of the market and specifically notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent downward momentum. However, the firm's conviction in AI stocks over Apple suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook. Given these points, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than it falling, but not drastically so, as the article also mentions Apple's strong 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks and its significant market capitalization.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's presidency. As a result, the stock price of Apple (AAPL) may rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure and fines. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases in the US, which could still pose a risk to the company. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung tapping Google and Qualcomm for the development of the Galaxy S25, positioning it directly against Apple's iPhone 17 Air. This could increase competition for Apple in the smartphone market. While Samsung has included advanced AI features like Google's AI model and voice assistant Bixby, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price seems more negative than positive. However, Apple's iPhone 17 Air also includes significant upgrades with AI features. The market may interpret this news negatively, especially if investors are concerned about increased competition.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
