This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple and Google regarding app store fees and mobile game distribution. While this could lead to potential long-term challenges for Apple if competition increases and developers shift towards alternative marketplaces, the immediate impact of this news is relatively neutral for Apple. The ruling in favor of Apple in recent court cases may reinforce investor confidence. Moreover, Apple's strong financial performance and ability to adapt are likely to help it weather competitive pressures. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced outlook rather than a drastic shift.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Apple already integrates ChatGPT and has Apple Intelligence in Siri, the launch of Perplexity Assistant poses a competitive threat. However, Perplexity is a smaller player, and Apple already has a significant footprint. The news also mentions that Apple might allow Perplexity on iOS, indicating a potential for collaboration or co-existence rather than direct competition. Considering Apple's scale, existing AI capabilities and potential for strategic partnerships, the impact of Perplexity's entry is likely to be minor/neutral. The price could fluctuate in anticipation from traders, but it is not likely to significantly push the stock up or down over the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple, along with other smartphone makers, is facing pressure from India to open up its app store.  This is potentially negative news for Apple as it could lead to reduced control over its app ecosystem and potentially lower revenue from app store fees. However, the impact is uncertain and depends on several factors: the extent to which India's demands are met, the potential economic impact of changes imposed, and Apple's ability to adapt its strategy.  The lack of detail in the available news snippet makes precise prediction difficult. Given the uncertainty and the relatively general nature of the news, it's reasonable to assume that the impact on Apple's stock price will be limited, resulting in only a small probability of a significant rise or fall in the stock price. The probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise owing to the negative potential of reduced control over its app ecosystem. Note that this analysis is based on limited information; a complete article may change this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Mark Zuckerberg's critique of Apple's lack of innovation but suggests that this may not significantly impact investors. This implies that while Apple's innovation might be questioned, its financial performance and investor confidence remain strong. Given Apple's established market position, consistent revenue streams, and investor focus on long-term stability rather than short-term innovation metrics, the stock price is less likely to react negatively to such critiques. However, the mention of innovation concerns could introduce mild uncertainty. Overall, the probability of a rise slightly outweighs the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's continued concern about the overall valuation of the market and specifically notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent downward momentum. However, the firm's conviction in AI stocks over Apple suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook. Given these points, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than it falling, but not drastically so, as the article also mentions Apple's strong 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks and its significant market capitalization.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's presidency. As a result, the stock price of Apple (AAPL) may rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure and fines. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases in the US, which could still pose a risk to the company. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung tapping Google and Qualcomm for the development of the Galaxy S25, positioning it directly against Apple's iPhone 17 Air. This could increase competition for Apple in the smartphone market. While Samsung has included advanced AI features like Google's AI model and voice assistant Bixby, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price seems more negative than positive. However, Apple's iPhone 17 Air also includes significant upgrades with AI features. The market may interpret this news negatively, especially if investors are concerned about increased competition.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple and Google, which may lead to increased pressure on Apple's app store revenue model. While Epic's efforts represent a significant challenge, the immediate impact on Apple's stock may be neutral due to its strong financial fundamentals and previous court victories against Epic. However, the escalating competition could have long-term implications for Apple's revenue from app stores, creating a slight tilt towards bearish sentiment. Considering previous predictions where a slight majority indicated a neutral to downward outlook, I estimate a higher probability of falling stock prices based on this ongoing competitive threat.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Perplexity launching an AI assistant to compete with established players like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. While this signifies increasing competition in the AI assistant space, it's important to consider Apple's existing strengths. Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence into Siri and partnered with OpenAI to include ChatGPT. The news suggests that Perplexity is also aiming to be available on iOS, implying potential collaboration or co-existence rather than a direct confrontation. Given Apple's large user base and established AI capabilities, the potential negative impact from Perplexity's challenge seems limited. However, the increased competition slightly tilts the probability towards a minor downward movement. Previous rounds of predictions were quite varied, displaying both bullish and bearish sentiments based on different news. Considering the trend of those previous predictions, as time goes by, the predictions tend to be more reasonable and consistent with the news content.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding India pressuring Apple and other smartphone makers to open up their app stores presents a mixed bag. On one hand, it suggests potential regulatory challenges and reduced control over the App Store ecosystem, which could negatively impact revenue from app store fees. This aligns with some previous predictions indicating a higher probability of a price fall due to similar regulatory concerns or increased competition.  However, the lack of detail in the headline makes it difficult to gauge the severity of the potential impact.  Apple's size, financial strength, and past ability to navigate regulatory hurdles suggest a resilience that could mitigate the negative impact. The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting market reaction based on limited information. Considering the potential negative impact alongside Apple's overall market position and ability to adapt, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a minor price fall, but the overall impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Mark Zuckerberg's critique of Apple's lack of innovation but suggests that this may not significantly impact investors. This implies that while Apple's innovation might be questioned, its financial performance and investor confidence remain strong. Given Apple's established market position, consistent revenue streams, and investor focus on long-term stability rather than short-term innovation metrics, the stock price is less likely to react negatively to such critiques. However, the mention of innovation concerns could introduce mild uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, which show a mix of opinions but lean slightly towards a neutral to positive outlook, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's investor letter, which mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of its holdings. The letter expresses concern about the overall market valuation and notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article highlights Apple's recent stock performance, including a -13.59% one-month return and a 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks. The firm's conviction in AI stocks over Apple suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook. Considering these points, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than it falling, but not drastically so, as Apple has a significant market capitalization and strong long-term performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's presidency. As a result, the stock price of Apple (AAPL) may rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure and fines. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases in the US, which could still pose a risk to the company. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which showed a range of opinions but mostly leaned towards a slight positive or neutral outlook for Apple's stock price, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung tapping Google and Qualcomm for the development of the Galaxy S25, positioning it directly against Apple's iPhone 17 Air. Increased competition can often lead to heightened market concerns regarding Apple's future market share and profitability in the smartphone segment. While the article acknowledges advancements in Apple's own AI features with the iPhone 17 Air, it emphasizes Samsung's aggressive strategy to leverage AI and other technologies to rival Apple. Given historical trends of investor reactions to increased competitive pressure, particularly in the tech sector, the announcement could instill a degree of caution among investors, potentially leading to a modest decrease in stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
