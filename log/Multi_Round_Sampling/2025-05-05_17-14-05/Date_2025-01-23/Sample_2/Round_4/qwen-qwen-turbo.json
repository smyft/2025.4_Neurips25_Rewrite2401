(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app distribution. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance of stability or slight growth following this news, rather than a significant decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the smartphone market with Samsung leveraging Google's AI and Qualcomm's chips. This is a negative factor for Apple as it suggests a more capable competitor. However, the article also mentions Apple's own advancements with the iPhone 17 Air and its AI features. Also, the article mentions the Samsung S25 will be available in the first half of 2025 and that the iPhone 17 Air will be slimmer. These considerations suggest the article doesn't necessarily portray a clear downside for Apple. Given Samsung maintaining prices and attempting advanced AI features, it should be a very slight negative. This could lead to some concern in investors but should be viewed as expected competition rather than a signal of future losses.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI, contrasting it with Apple's facing headwinds in China and regulatory pressures.  Nvidia's higher gross profit margin and significant revenue growth further strengthen its position. While Apple maintains strong sales and margins, the article suggests Nvidia's outlook is stronger, potentially leading to a shift in market capitalization. However, the article also acknowledges that Nvidia's growth might slow compared to the exceptional performance of 2024. Therefore, while Nvidia's potential to surpass Apple is significant and affects investor sentiment positively,  it's unlikely to trigger an immediate, drastic fall in Apple's stock price. The probability of a stock price rise for Apple is lower than usual due to the direct comparison, but a significant fall seems improbable given Apple's established market position and brand strength.  The probabilities are weighted more towards the implications of the comparative analysis in the news and less on immediate market reaction to the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is among Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks, which could positively influence investor sentiment given Loeb's reputation and track record. The article emphasizes Apple's strong financial health, including $27 billion in operating cash flow and $29 billion returned to shareholders, as well as its long-term strategic initiatives in education and sustainability. These factors are likely to be viewed favorably by the market. However, the article also notes that AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb\u2019s top picks, suggesting that other stocks may offer higher returns. Overall, the positive aspects of the news outweigh the neutral/negative ones, leading to a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This neutral outlook implies that there are no major surprises or significant deviations from expectations. Typically, such news would be viewed as neither strongly positive nor negative, potentially leading to a stable or slightly positive stock price movement due to the absence of negative surprises. However, the actual impact can depend on various factors including market sentiment and comparisons to previous guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple Inc. and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, given the size and resilience of these companies, the impact might be limited. The probability of the stock price rising seems lower due to the potential negative implications of the probe, while the probability of the stock price falling appears higher due to regulatory risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights potential negative regulatory pressures on tech giants including Apple due to ongoing antitrust issues with the EU. President Trump's comments suggest support for these companies against EU regulations, which could potentially lead to a more favorable regulatory environment in the future. However, the immediate impacts from recent fines and continuing legal battles could have a negative effect on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple through the introduction of third-party games highlights the ongoing challenges Apple faces in its app store ecosystem. While this competition may raise concerns about future revenue impacts due to the dominance of Apple's app store fees, the news also reflects continued federal support for Apple amidst ongoing disputes. Historically, Apple's strong market position and ability to pivot in response to market changes suggest that the negative impact of this news may be limited. Therefore, I predict a moderate chance of price stability with a slight inclination towards a rise, as Apple's established brand and ecosystem continue to draw investor confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple using Google AI and Qualcomm tech in their new Galaxy S25. This increased competition in the high-end smartphone market presents a potential threat to Apple's market share and profit margins. However, Apple is also innovating with the iPhone 17 Air. The previous rounds show mixed sentiment. Some rounds highlight increased competition, leading to price falls. Others, highlight positive financial aspects, leading to price rises. This suggests the market's sensitivity to competitive pressures more than anything. Given the specific context of Samsung directly rivaling Apple with new tech, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher. Considering all previous predictions and the latest information, a drop is slightly more likely given the heightened competition directly challenging Apple's iPhone.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a comparative analysis between Apple and Nvidia, highlighting Nvidia's stronger growth prospects driven by the AI boom.  Nvidia's superior gross margins and revenue growth are compelling arguments for its potential to surpass Apple in market capitalization. Apple, on the other hand, faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US. Although Apple maintains strong sales and margins, the article suggests a less robust outlook compared to Nvidia. While a significant drop in Apple's stock price is unlikely given its established position, the direct comparison with Nvidia's high-growth trajectory paints a less optimistic picture for Apple in the short to medium term. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty. However, the prevailing sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of Nvidia outperforming Apple, indirectly suggesting a potential for Apple's stock price to slightly underperform or stagnate compared to expectations. Considering these factors and the comparative analysis presented, I've assigned a higher probability to a price fall, but it remains moderate, reflecting the strong established position of Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks, which is a positive signal given Loeb's reputation and successful track record. The article emphasizes Apple's strong financial health, including $27 billion in operating cash flow and $29 billion returned to shareholders, along with strategic initiatives in education and sustainability. These factors are likely to bolster investor confidence. However, the article also notes that AAPL ranks 12th on Loeb\u2019s list, suggesting other stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the positive aspects of the news outweigh the neutral/negative ones, leading to a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple and Alphabet's Google facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems introduces regulatory uncertainty, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering the previous predictions and the trend of others' beliefs, there's a mix of views on how this news might affect Apple's stock price. Some models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the potential negative implications of the probe, while others consider the impact might be limited due to the size and resilience of these companies. Given the regulatory risks and the potential for increased costs or changes in business practices, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower. However, Apple's strong financial health, brand strength, and the fact that regulatory probes are not uncommon for large tech companies, suggest that a drastic fall is also unlikely. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than that of falling, reflecting the cautious stance due to regulatory uncertainty but also considering Apple's robust market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights increased regulatory scrutiny and antitrust issues faced by Apple due to actions from the EU. President Trump's criticism of these regulations adds a political dimension, though it is unclear how it will translate into concrete regulatory changes. There are recent examples of substantial fines imposed on Apple by the EU, which negatively affect its financials and could dampen investor sentiment. Although Trump supports American companies against EU regulation, it is uncertain how much impact this support will have in the short term. Given the recent trends and the mixed signals provided by different models in previous rounds, the current news could moderately increase the probability of a stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is intensifying its competition with Apple by introducing third-party games into its mobile marketplace, which could heighten concerns regarding Apple's market share and revenue streams. However, the federal court has previously ruled largely in favor of Apple, and the company retains a strong market position with its robust ecosystem. Despite some threats from competition and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, the strong brand reputation and financial health of Apple may mitigate significant price drops. Therefore, while the negative aspects of heightened competition are acknowledged, the established market position and potential for resilience in Apple's business model suggest a moderate chance of rising stock prices over falling ones.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete directly with Apple in the high-end smartphone market by leveraging Google's AI and Qualcomm's technology. This signifies increased competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and profit margins. While Apple is also innovating with the iPhone 17 Air, the immediate threat posed by Samsung\u2019s new flagship device suggests a likely negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price. Previous rounds show a mix of reactions, with some focusing on Apple's financial strength and others emphasizing competitive pressures. The market seems sensitive to potential challenges to Apple's dominance. Given that Samsung is directly targeting Apple's market share with advanced features, a higher probability of a stock price fall is warranted. Considering the trends of previous predictions, the competitive landscape, and Apple's established position, I lean towards a slightly negative impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article compares Apple's and Nvidia's potential for future growth, suggesting Nvidia's stronger outlook due to the booming AI market.  Nvidia's higher profit margins and revenue growth are highlighted, contrasting with Apple's challenges in China and regulatory pressures. While Apple maintains significant market share and profitability, the article implies a less optimistic growth trajectory compared to Nvidia.  The previous predictions show varied opinions, some leaning towards Apple rising due to positive financial indicators or billionaire endorsements, and others predicting a fall due to rising competition and regulatory risks.  Considering the comparative analysis within the article, which focuses on Nvidia's superior growth potential and Apple's headwinds, I've weighted the probabilities more towards a potential fall. However, Apple's substantial market dominance and brand recognition suggest a sharp decline is unlikely.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall change is likely to be moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks, which is a positive signal given Loeb's reputation and successful track record.

Although Trump supports American companies against EU regulation, it is uncertain how much impact this support will have in the short term. Given the recent trends and the mixed signals provided by different models in previous rounds, the current news could moderately increase the probability of a stock price decline.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games ramping up its competition with Apple highlights an intensifying battle over app store fees and the introduction of third-party games, raising concerns about Apple's market share and revenue. While this competition is significant, previous federal court rulings have mostly favored Apple, and the company maintains a strong ecosystem that provides some resistance to potential negative impacts. Additionally, Apple's financial health and brand strength, combined with historical resilience, suggest that while there may be pressure on the stock price, a drastic fall is unlikely. Based on the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current context, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, reflecting investor confidence in Apple's long-term viability despite existing competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's attempt to compete with Apple by leveraging Google's AI and Qualcomm's tech in their upcoming Galaxy S25. This poses a competitive threat that could negatively impact Apple's market share and potential profit margins. While Apple is also innovating, the direct challenge from Samsung is significant. Previous rounds show that competitive pressure leads to a slight downward pressure on the stock price, with most indicating a higher chance of stock price falling. Considering all previous predictions and the weight of this new information specifically challenging Apple, I believe a price fall is more likely and it is trending to be even more likely in the previous rounds. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the potential for Nvidia to surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company.  While this is primarily a comparison of two companies and doesn't directly address Apple's intrinsic value, it highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price.  Nvidia's strong growth in the AI sector, contrasted with Apple's facing headwinds in China and regulatory pressures, presents a negative narrative for Apple's short-term prospects.  Nvidia's higher profit margins and revenue growth further support this narrative.  However, Apple maintains a strong brand, significant market share, and substantial profitability.  The analysis of previous predictions reveals a consistent uncertainty regarding Apple\u2019s stock price movement, with probabilities often leaning slightly toward a fall due to competition and regulatory risks but rarely exceeding a 0.6 probability of a fall.  The current news reinforces these concerns.  While a dramatic drop is unlikely given Apple's established position, the comparison with Nvidia's rapid growth suggests a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation than a significant rise in the short-term.  I'm weighing the negative aspects of the comparison more heavily than the positive aspects of Apple's inherent strengths because the news directly focuses on a competitive threat and weaker growth outlook compared to a competitor.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc.
