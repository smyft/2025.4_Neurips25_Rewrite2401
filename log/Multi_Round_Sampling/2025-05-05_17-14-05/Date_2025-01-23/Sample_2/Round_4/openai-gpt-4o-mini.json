(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app distribution. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance of stability or slight growth following this news, rather than a significant decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the smartphone market with Samsung leveraging Google's AI and Qualcomm's chips. This is a negative factor for Apple as it suggests a more capable competitor. However, the article also mentions Apple's own advancements with the iPhone 17 Air and its AI features. Also, the article mentions the Samsung S25 will be available in the first half of 2025 and that the iPhone 17 Air will be slimmer. These considerations suggest the article doesn't necessarily portray a clear downside for Apple. Given Samsung maintaining prices and attempting advanced AI features, it should be a very slight negative. This could lead to some concern in investors but should be viewed as expected competition rather than a signal of future losses.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI, contrasting it with Apple's facing headwinds in China and regulatory pressures.  Nvidia's higher gross profit margin and significant revenue growth further strengthen its position. While Apple maintains strong sales and margins, the article suggests Nvidia's outlook is stronger, potentially leading to a shift in market capitalization. However, the article also acknowledges that Nvidia's growth might slow compared to the exceptional performance of 2024. Therefore, while Nvidia's potential to surpass Apple is significant and affects investor sentiment positively,  it's unlikely to trigger an immediate, drastic fall in Apple's stock price. The probability of a stock price rise for Apple is lower than usual due to the direct comparison, but a significant fall seems improbable given Apple's established market position and brand strength.  The probabilities are weighted more towards the implications of the comparative analysis in the news and less on immediate market reaction to the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is among Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks, which could positively influence investor sentiment given Loeb's reputation and track record. The article emphasizes Apple's strong financial health, including $27 billion in operating cash flow and $29 billion returned to shareholders, as well as its long-term strategic initiatives in education and sustainability. These factors are likely to be viewed favorably by the market. However, the article also notes that AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb\u2019s top picks, suggesting that other stocks may offer higher returns. Overall, the positive aspects of the news outweigh the neutral/negative ones, leading to a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This neutral outlook implies that there are no major surprises or significant deviations from expectations. Typically, such news would be viewed as neither strongly positive nor negative, potentially leading to a stable or slightly positive stock price movement due to the absence of negative surprises. However, the actual impact can depend on various factors including market sentiment and comparisons to previous guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple Inc. and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, given the size and resilience of these companies, the impact might be limited. The probability of the stock price rising seems lower due to the potential negative implications of the probe, while the probability of the stock price falling appears higher due to regulatory risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights potential negative regulatory pressures on tech giants including Apple due to ongoing antitrust issues with the EU. President Trump's comments suggest support for these companies against EU regulations, which could potentially lead to a more favorable regulatory environment in the future. However, the immediate impacts from recent fines and continuing legal battles could have a negative effect on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple through the introduction of third-party games highlights the ongoing challenges Apple faces in its app store ecosystem. While this competition may raise concerns about future revenue impacts due to the dominance of Apple's app store fees, the news also reflects continued federal support for Apple amidst ongoing disputes. Historically, Apple's strong market position and ability to pivot in response to market changes suggest that the negative impact of this news may be limited. Therefore, I predict a moderate chance of price stability with a slight inclination towards a rise, as Apple's established brand and ecosystem continue to draw investor confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple using Google AI and Qualcomm tech in their new Galaxy S25. This increased competition in the high-end smartphone market presents a potential threat to Apple's market share and profit margins. However, Apple is also innovating with the iPhone 17 Air. The previous rounds show mixed sentiment. Some rounds highlight increased competition, leading to price falls. Others, highlight positive financial aspects, leading to price rises. This suggests the market's sensitivity to competitive pressures more than anything. Given the specific context of Samsung directly rivaling Apple with new tech, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher. Considering all previous predictions and the latest information, a drop is slightly more likely given the heightened competition directly challenging Apple's iPhone.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a comparative analysis between Apple and Nvidia, highlighting Nvidia's stronger growth prospects driven by the AI boom.  Nvidia's superior gross margins and revenue growth are compelling arguments for its potential to surpass Apple in market capitalization. Apple, on the other hand, faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US. Although Apple maintains strong sales and margins, the article suggests a less robust outlook compared to Nvidia. While a significant drop in Apple's stock price is unlikely given its established position, the direct comparison with Nvidia's high-growth trajectory paints a less optimistic picture for Apple in the short to medium term. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty. However, the prevailing sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of Nvidia outperforming Apple, indirectly suggesting a potential for Apple's stock price to slightly underperform or stagnate compared to expectations. Considering these factors and the comparative analysis presented, I've assigned a higher probability to a price fall, but it remains moderate, reflecting the strong established position of Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks, which is a positive signal given Loeb's reputation and successful track record. The article emphasizes Apple's strong financial health, including $27 billion in operating cash flow and $29 billion returned to shareholders, along with strategic initiatives in education and sustainability. These factors are likely to bolster investor confidence. However, the article also notes that AAPL ranks 12th on Loeb\u2019s list, suggesting other stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the positive aspects of the news outweigh the neutral/negative ones, leading to a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple and Alphabet's Google facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems introduces regulatory uncertainty, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering the previous predictions and the trend of others' beliefs, there's a mix of views on how this news might affect Apple's stock price. Some models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the potential negative implications of the probe, while others consider the impact might be limited due to the size and resilience of these companies. Given the regulatory risks and the potential for increased costs or changes in business practices, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower. However, Apple's strong financial health, brand strength, and the fact that regulatory probes are not uncommon for large tech companies, suggest that a drastic fall is also unlikely. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than that of falling, reflecting the cautious stance due to regulatory uncertainty but also considering Apple's robust market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights increased regulatory scrutiny and antitrust issues faced by Apple due to actions from the EU. President Trump's criticism of these regulations adds a political dimension, though it is unclear how it will translate into concrete regulatory changes. There are recent examples of substantial fines imposed on Apple by the EU, which negatively affect its financials and could dampen investor sentiment. Although Trump supports American companies against EU regulation, it is uncertain how much impact this support will have in the short term. Given the recent trends and the mixed signals provided by different models in previous rounds, the current news could moderately increase the probability of a stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is intensifying its competition with Apple by introducing third-party games into its mobile marketplace, which could heighten concerns regarding Apple's market share and revenue streams. However, the federal court has previously ruled largely in favor of Apple, and the company retains a strong market position with its robust ecosystem. Despite some threats from competition and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, the strong brand reputation and financial health of Apple may mitigate significant price drops. Therefore, while the negative aspects of heightened competition are acknowledged, the established market position and potential for resilience in Apple's business model suggest a moderate chance of rising stock prices over falling ones.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete directly with Apple in the high-end smartphone market by leveraging Google's AI and Qualcomm's technology. This signifies increased competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and profit margins. While Apple is also innovating with the iPhone 17 Air, the immediate threat posed by Samsung\u2019s new flagship device suggests a likely negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price. Previous rounds show a mix of reactions, with some focusing on Apple's financial strength and others emphasizing competitive pressures. The market seems sensitive to potential challenges to Apple's dominance. Given that Samsung is directly targeting Apple's market share with advanced features, a higher probability of a stock price fall is warranted. Considering the trends of previous predictions, the competitive landscape, and Apple's established position, I lean towards a slightly negative impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article compares Apple's and Nvidia's potential for future growth, suggesting Nvidia's stronger outlook due to the booming AI market.  Nvidia's higher profit margins and revenue growth are highlighted, contrasting with Apple's challenges in China and regulatory pressures. While Apple maintains significant market share and profitability, the article implies a less optimistic growth trajectory compared to Nvidia.  The previous predictions show varied opinions, some leaning towards Apple rising due to positive financial indicators or billionaire endorsements, and others predicting a fall due to rising competition and regulatory risks.  Considering the comparative analysis within the article, which focuses on Nvidia's superior growth potential and Apple's headwinds, I've weighted the probabilities more towards a potential fall. However, Apple's substantial market dominance and brand recognition suggest a sharp decline is unlikely.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall change is likely to be moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks, which is a positive signal given Loeb's reputation and successful track record.

Although Trump supports American companies against EU regulation, it is uncertain how much impact this support will have in the short term. Given the recent trends and the mixed signals provided by different models in previous rounds, the current news could moderately increase the probability of a stock price decline.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games ramping up its competition with Apple highlights an intensifying battle over app store fees and the introduction of third-party games, raising concerns about Apple's market share and revenue. While this competition is significant, previous federal court rulings have mostly favored Apple, and the company maintains a strong ecosystem that provides some resistance to potential negative impacts. Additionally, Apple's financial health and brand strength, combined with historical resilience, suggest that while there may be pressure on the stock price, a drastic fall is unlikely. Based on the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current context, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, reflecting investor confidence in Apple's long-term viability despite existing competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's attempt to compete with Apple by leveraging Google's AI and Qualcomm's tech in their upcoming Galaxy S25. This poses a competitive threat that could negatively impact Apple's market share and potential profit margins. While Apple is also innovating, the direct challenge from Samsung is significant. Previous rounds show that competitive pressure leads to a slight downward pressure on the stock price, with most indicating a higher chance of stock price falling. Considering all previous predictions and the weight of this new information specifically challenging Apple, I believe a price fall is more likely and it is trending to be even more likely in the previous rounds. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the potential for Nvidia to surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company.  While this is primarily a comparison of two companies and doesn't directly address Apple's intrinsic value, it highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price.  Nvidia's strong growth in the AI sector, contrasted with Apple's facing headwinds in China and regulatory pressures, presents a negative narrative for Apple's short-term prospects.  Nvidia's higher profit margins and revenue growth further support this narrative.  However, Apple maintains a strong brand, significant market share, and substantial profitability.  The analysis of previous predictions reveals a consistent uncertainty regarding Apple\u2019s stock price movement, with probabilities often leaning slightly toward a fall due to competition and regulatory risks but rarely exceeding a 0.6 probability of a fall.  The current news reinforces these concerns.  While a dramatic drop is unlikely given Apple's established position, the comparison with Nvidia's rapid growth suggests a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation than a significant rise in the short-term.  I'm weighing the negative aspects of the comparison more heavily than the positive aspects of Apple's inherent strengths because the news directly focuses on a competitive threat and weaker growth outlook compared to a competitor.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is among Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks, which is a positive signal given Loeb's reputation and successful track record.

Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise due to positive financial indicators and others predicting a fall due to competitive or regulatory risks. Considering the overall sentiment and the specific positive aspects of this news, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than that of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley.
