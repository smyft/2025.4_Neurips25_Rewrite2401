This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app distribution. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance of stability or slight growth following this news, rather than a significant decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the smartphone market with Samsung leveraging Google's AI and Qualcomm's chips. This is a negative factor for Apple as it suggests a more capable competitor. However, the article also mentions Apple's own advancements with the iPhone 17 Air and its AI features. Also, the article mentions the Samsung S25 will be available in the first half of 2025 and that the iPhone 17 Air will be slimmer. These considerations suggest the article doesn't necessarily portray a clear downside for Apple. Given Samsung maintaining prices and attempting advanced AI features, it should be a very slight negative. This could lead to some concern in investors but should be viewed as expected competition rather than a signal of future losses.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI, contrasting it with Apple's facing headwinds in China and regulatory pressures.  Nvidia's higher gross profit margin and significant revenue growth further strengthen its position. While Apple maintains strong sales and margins, the article suggests Nvidia's outlook is stronger, potentially leading to a shift in market capitalization. However, the article also acknowledges that Nvidia's growth might slow compared to the exceptional performance of 2024. Therefore, while Nvidia's potential to surpass Apple is significant and affects investor sentiment positively,  it's unlikely to trigger an immediate, drastic fall in Apple's stock price. The probability of a stock price rise for Apple is lower than usual due to the direct comparison, but a significant fall seems improbable given Apple's established market position and brand strength.  The probabilities are weighted more towards the implications of the comparative analysis in the news and less on immediate market reaction to the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is among Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks, which could positively influence investor sentiment given Loeb's reputation and track record. The article emphasizes Apple's strong financial health, including $27 billion in operating cash flow and $29 billion returned to shareholders, as well as its long-term strategic initiatives in education and sustainability. These factors are likely to be viewed favorably by the market. However, the article also notes that AAPL ranks 12th on the list of Loeb\u2019s top picks, suggesting that other stocks may offer higher returns. Overall, the positive aspects of the news outweigh the neutral/negative ones, leading to a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This neutral outlook implies that there are no major surprises or significant deviations from expectations. Typically, such news would be viewed as neither strongly positive nor negative, potentially leading to a stable or slightly positive stock price movement due to the absence of negative surprises. However, the actual impact can depend on various factors including market sentiment and comparisons to previous guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple Inc. and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, given the size and resilience of these companies, the impact might be limited. The probability of the stock price rising seems lower due to the potential negative implications of the probe, while the probability of the stock price falling appears higher due to regulatory risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights potential negative regulatory pressures on tech giants including Apple due to ongoing antitrust issues with the EU. President Trump's comments suggest support for these companies against EU regulations, which could potentially lead to a more favorable regulatory environment in the future. However, the immediate impacts from recent fines and continuing legal battles could have a negative effect on investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
