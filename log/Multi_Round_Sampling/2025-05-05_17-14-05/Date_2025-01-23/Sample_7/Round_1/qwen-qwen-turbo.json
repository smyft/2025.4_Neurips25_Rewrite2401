(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Oracle Takes Run at Cloud\u2019s Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app developers. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance of stability or slight growth following this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio and that Buffett's team has invested in Apple for its AI capabilities. While Berkshire Hathaway recently reduced its stake in Apple, the news emphasizes that Apple remains its largest holding with 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The fact that Buffett's investment decisions are widely respected suggests that Apple's stock might be viewed positively by other investors due to this validation. It's likely to create positive investor sentiment. The news emphasizes that Apple's AI strategy has been implemented with the integration of AI features such as writing enhancement tools, priority notifications, and Siri's makeover and the integration with ChatGPT.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system.  Without access to the full article, it's impossible to gauge the severity of the potential consequences.  However, regulatory investigations often lead to uncertainty in the market. While a significant fine or mandated changes could negatively impact Apple's stock price, the probe's impact may be minimal if the investigation finds no wrongdoing or results in minor changes.  Given the lack of detail, it's reasonable to assume a relatively neutral market reaction, leaning slightly towards a negative impact due to the inherent uncertainty and potential negative publicity associated with regulatory scrutiny.  The probability of a stock price rise is thus assigned a lower value compared to the probability of a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace. This could potentially divert revenue away from Apple's App Store, which is a significant source of income for Apple. However, the impact might be limited as Apple still has a strong ecosystem and user base. The market might react negatively to the potential loss of control and revenue, but the overall effect is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, the impact of such probes can be uncertain and may not necessarily lead to a significant drop in stock price. Given the uncertainty and the fact that both companies have faced regulatory challenges before, the probability of a significant stock price move in either direction is difficult to predict with high confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
