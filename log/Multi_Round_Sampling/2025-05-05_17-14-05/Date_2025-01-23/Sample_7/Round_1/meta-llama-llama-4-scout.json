(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple faces a 'fork in the road year,' analysts say\nNews Content: Photo: Cheng Xin (Getty Images)\n\nAs Apple (AAPL) stock takes a tumble to kick off 2025, analysts at Wedbush don\u2019t see cause for concern.\n\n\u201cWe believe the panic and bear frenzy around Apple is way overdone\u201d heading into next week\u2019s December earnings report, analysts led by Dan Ives said in a research note Wednesday.\n\nSo far this year, shares of the Cupertino, California-based company are down more than 8% as expectations around sales for the 2025 fiscal year fall short. Last week, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance.\n\nShares of Apple were up 0.25% Wednesday morning, after closing at $223.83 Tuesday.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies also said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March.\n\nThis slide in stock price caused chipmaker Nvidia to overtake Apple as the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.\n\nBut analysts at Wedbush said that overall unit declines in China are \u201cmanageable,\u201d and that investors will get a better understanding of Apple\u2019s China turnaround once it announces its regional AI partner, which will likely be Baidu (BIDU). Tencent (TCEHY) and ByteDance are also in the running, Ives said.\n\nAs a result, the securities firm maintained its \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and $325 price target\n\n\u201cWith Apple Intelligence being rolled out in a phased strategy the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle is the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world\u2019s population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nAlthough Jefferies and others have raised concerns about Apple\u2019s AI strategy, which came late in the game compared with competitors and is being rolled out in phases through the tech giant\u2019s latest models, Ives believes 2025 will be a \u201cfork in the road year\u201d for Apple.\n\n\u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither will Apple\u2019s AI strategy,\u201d Ives said. \u201cbut the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.\u201d\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app developers. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance of stability or slight growth following this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio and that Buffett's team has invested in Apple for its AI capabilities. While Berkshire Hathaway recently reduced its stake in Apple, the news emphasizes that Apple remains its largest holding with 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The fact that Buffett's investment decisions are widely respected suggests that Apple's stock might be viewed positively by other investors due to this validation. It's likely to create positive investor sentiment. The news emphasizes that Apple's AI strategy has been implemented with the integration of AI features such as writing enhancement tools, priority notifications, and Siri's makeover and the integration with ChatGPT.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system.  Without access to the full article, it's impossible to gauge the severity of the potential consequences.  However, regulatory investigations often lead to uncertainty in the market. While a significant fine or mandated changes could negatively impact Apple's stock price, the probe's impact may be minimal if the investigation finds no wrongdoing or results in minor changes.  Given the lack of detail, it's reasonable to assume a relatively neutral market reaction, leaning slightly towards a negative impact due to the inherent uncertainty and potential negative publicity associated with regulatory scrutiny.  The probability of a stock price rise is thus assigned a lower value compared to the probability of a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace. This could potentially divert revenue away from Apple's App Store, which is a significant source of income for Apple. However, the impact might be limited as Apple still has a strong ecosystem and user base. The market might react negatively to the potential loss of control and revenue, but the overall effect is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, the impact of such probes can be uncertain and may not necessarily lead to a significant drop in stock price. Given the uncertainty and the fact that both companies have faced regulatory challenges before, the probability of a significant stock price move in either direction is difficult to predict with high confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
