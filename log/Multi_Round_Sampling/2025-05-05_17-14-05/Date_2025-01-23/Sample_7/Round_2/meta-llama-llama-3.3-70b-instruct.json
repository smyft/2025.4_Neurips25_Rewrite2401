(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\nNews Content: (Updates with Apple's response in the sixth paragraph.)

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app developers. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance of stability or slight growth following this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio and that Buffett's team has invested in Apple for its AI capabilities. While Berkshire Hathaway recently reduced its stake in Apple, the news emphasizes that Apple remains its largest holding with 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The fact that Buffett's investment decisions are widely respected suggests that Apple's stock might be viewed positively by other investors due to this validation. It's likely to create positive investor sentiment. The news emphasizes that Apple's AI strategy has been implemented with the integration of AI features such as writing enhancement tools, priority notifications, and Siri's makeover and the integration with ChatGPT.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system.  Without access to the full article, it's impossible to gauge the severity of the potential consequences.  However, regulatory investigations often lead to uncertainty in the market. While a significant fine or mandated changes could negatively impact Apple's stock price, the probe's impact may be minimal if the investigation finds no wrongdoing or results in minor changes.  Given the lack of detail, it's reasonable to assume a relatively neutral market reaction, leaning slightly towards a negative impact due to the inherent uncertainty and potential negative publicity associated with regulatory scrutiny.  The probability of a stock price rise is thus assigned a lower value compared to the probability of a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace. This could potentially divert revenue away from Apple's App Store, which is a significant source of income for Apple. However, the impact might be limited as Apple still has a strong ecosystem and user base. The market might react negatively to the potential loss of control and revenue, but the overall effect is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, the impact of such probes can be uncertain and may not necessarily lead to a significant drop in stock price. Given the uncertainty and the fact that both companies have faced regulatory challenges before, the probability of a significant stock price move in either direction is difficult to predict with high confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing challenge to Apple\u2019s App Store dominance by introducing third-party games, which could potentially shift revenue away from Apple\u2019s ecosystem. However, given that previous court rulings have favored Apple and the company maintains a strong position in mobile markets with a loyal customer base, the overall market impact may be more limited than initially perceived. The high-value branding and robust ecosystem of Apple could mitigate adverse effects from the competitive pressure and regulatory scrutiny mentioned in the news. Therefore, while there is some potential for negative stock movement, the chances of a rise remain significant due to Apple's established market strength and resilience in face of competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's continued confidence in Apple as his largest holding, even after trimming the position. The article emphasizes Apple's proactive approach and investment in AI across its products, including new AI features in Apple Intelligence and Siri's integration with ChatGPT. Considering Buffett's reputation as a value investor and Apple's strong presence in the AI space, this news is likely to be viewed positively by investors, boosting investor confidence., I will consider others' prediction to balance my decision. Despite recent trimming of posititon in AAPL, it remains No.1 of BRK portfolio. Many models predict that the stock price will rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystem and operating system introduces uncertainty.  While the full details are unavailable, regulatory investigations often cause market volatility.  However, Apple's size and established position suggest the impact might be limited unless the investigation reveals significant wrongdoing.  Considering previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion.  Some models emphasize Apple's strong position and positive investor sentiment (Buffett's investment), while others highlight the risks associated with regulatory uncertainty.  The lack of detail in the headline makes a precise prediction difficult.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and potential for negative press associated with the probe, but acknowledging the strong underlying fundamentals of Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace, which could potentially impact Apple's App Store revenue. However, Apple's strong ecosystem and user base may mitigate some of this impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong position and potential AI developments, while others indicate a higher probability of a fall due to regulatory scrutiny and competition. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the previous predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to Apple's robust ecosystem and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current challenges and opportunities, highlighting a 'fork in the road year' for the company. Analysts at Wedbush believe that the panic around Apple's stock is overdone and maintain an 'Outperform' rating with a $325 price target. They emphasize that Apple's AI strategy, including the rollout of Apple Intelligence, will drive growth in the coming years. However, concerns about iPhone sales and hardware upgrades have been raised by other analysts. Given these mixed perspectives, the stock price movement is uncertain but slightly more inclined towards a positive outlook due to the AI strategy and growth potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, considering the previous predictions and the fact that Apple has a strong ecosystem and user base, the impact might be limited. The probabilities of stock price movement are estimated based on the analysis of the news and the trend of others' beliefs, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or slightly negative reaction due to the uncertainty and potential negative publicity associated with regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Since the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc., it may not have a significant direct influence on AAPL's stock price. However, given the broader context of market dynamics and investor sentiments, there's a moderate likelihood of a positive outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
