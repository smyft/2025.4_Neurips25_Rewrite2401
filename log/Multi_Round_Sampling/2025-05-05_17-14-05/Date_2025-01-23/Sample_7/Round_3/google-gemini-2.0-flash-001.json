(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app developers. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance of stability or slight growth following this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio and that Buffett's team has invested in Apple for its AI capabilities. While Berkshire Hathaway recently reduced its stake in Apple, the news emphasizes that Apple remains its largest holding with 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The fact that Buffett's investment decisions are widely respected suggests that Apple's stock might be viewed positively by other investors due to this validation. It's likely to create positive investor sentiment. The news emphasizes that Apple's AI strategy has been implemented with the integration of AI features such as writing enhancement tools, priority notifications, and Siri's makeover and the integration with ChatGPT.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system.  Without access to the full article, it's impossible to gauge the severity of the potential consequences.  However, regulatory investigations often lead to uncertainty in the market. While a significant fine or mandated changes could negatively impact Apple's stock price, the probe's impact may be minimal if the investigation finds no wrongdoing or results in minor changes.  Given the lack of detail, it's reasonable to assume a relatively neutral market reaction, leaning slightly towards a negative impact due to the inherent uncertainty and potential negative publicity associated with regulatory scrutiny.  The probability of a stock price rise is thus assigned a lower value compared to the probability of a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace. This could potentially divert revenue away from Apple's App Store, which is a significant source of income for Apple. However, the impact might be limited as Apple still has a strong ecosystem and user base. The market might react negatively to the potential loss of control and revenue, but the overall effect is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, the impact of such probes can be uncertain and may not necessarily lead to a significant drop in stock price. Given the uncertainty and the fact that both companies have faced regulatory challenges before, the probability of a significant stock price move in either direction is difficult to predict with high confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing challenge to Apple\u2019s App Store dominance by introducing third-party games, which could potentially shift revenue away from Apple\u2019s ecosystem. However, given that previous court rulings have favored Apple and the company maintains a strong position in mobile markets with a loyal customer base, the overall market impact may be more limited than initially perceived. The high-value branding and robust ecosystem of Apple could mitigate adverse effects from the competitive pressure and regulatory scrutiny mentioned in the news. Therefore, while there is some potential for negative stock movement, the chances of a rise remain significant due to Apple's established market strength and resilience in face of competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's continued confidence in Apple as his largest holding, even after trimming the position. The article emphasizes Apple's proactive approach and investment in AI across its products, including new AI features in Apple Intelligence and Siri's integration with ChatGPT. Considering Buffett's reputation as a value investor and Apple's strong presence in the AI space, this news is likely to be viewed positively by investors, boosting investor confidence., I will consider others' prediction to balance my decision. Despite recent trimming of posititon in AAPL, it remains No.1 of BRK portfolio. Many models predict that the stock price will rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystem and operating system introduces uncertainty.  While the full details are unavailable, regulatory investigations often cause market volatility.  However, Apple's size and established position suggest the impact might be limited unless the investigation reveals significant wrongdoing.  Considering previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion.  Some models emphasize Apple's strong position and positive investor sentiment (Buffett's investment), while others highlight the risks associated with regulatory uncertainty.  The lack of detail in the headline makes a precise prediction difficult.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and potential for negative press associated with the probe, but acknowledging the strong underlying fundamentals of Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace, which could potentially impact Apple's App Store revenue. However, Apple's strong ecosystem and user base may mitigate some of this impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong position and potential AI developments, while others indicate a higher probability of a fall due to regulatory scrutiny and competition. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the previous predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to Apple's robust ecosystem and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current challenges and opportunities, highlighting a 'fork in the road year' for the company. Analysts at Wedbush believe that the panic around Apple's stock is overdone and maintain an 'Outperform' rating with a $325 price target. They emphasize that Apple's AI strategy, including the rollout of Apple Intelligence, will drive growth in the coming years. However, concerns about iPhone sales and hardware upgrades have been raised by other analysts. Given these mixed perspectives, the stock price movement is uncertain but slightly more inclined towards a positive outlook due to the AI strategy and growth potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, considering the previous predictions and the fact that Apple has a strong ecosystem and user base, the impact might be limited. The probabilities of stock price movement are estimated based on the analysis of the news and the trend of others' beliefs, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or slightly negative reaction due to the uncertainty and potential negative publicity associated with regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Since the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc., it may not have a significant direct influence on AAPL's stock price. However, given the broader context of market dynamics and investor sentiments, there's a moderate likelihood of a positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is intensifying competition with Apple by introducing third-party games, which could threaten Apple's App Store revenue. However, previous court rulings have mostly favored Apple, and the company retains a strong ecosystem with a loyal customer base. Additionally, investor sentiment appears optimistic due to Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple, highlighting confidence in the company's long-term prospects. While regulatory scrutiny and competition create some risk, the overall fundamentals and market position of Apple suggest a greater probability of stock price stability or slight growth rather than decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple as an AI play, despite a slight reduction in his holdings. This is generally positive, as Buffett's investments often signal strong underlying value. The article emphasizes Apple's advancements in AI, integration of AI features (Apple Intelligence and Siri with ChatGPT), and its massive user base (2.2 billion devices), suggesting significant potential for AI distribution and growth. The previous round's predictions show a positive sentiment, with most models predicting a rise. Taking all of this into consideration, the likelihood of a stock price increase is elevated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about the UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystem is a negative factor, introducing uncertainty and potential for negative publicity.  However, the lack of detail in the available headline and the premium nature of the full article prevent a precise assessment of the severity.  The previous predictions are mixed.  Some models highlight Apple's strong position, AI investments (and Buffett's continued holding, albeit reduced), arguing for a higher probability of a price rise. Others emphasize the regulatory uncertainty and potential negative impacts, predicting a higher likelihood of a price fall.  Considering the overall situation, the weight of evidence suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the inherent uncertainty of regulatory probes.  However, Apple's resilience and market dominance means the fall is likely to be moderate.  The consistent predictions of a rise in the models considering external factors (like Buffett's investment and Apple's AI efforts) are important to consider and help mitigate the negative effect of the investigation news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' challenge to Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace, which could potentially impact Apple's revenue from the App Store. However, Apple's strong ecosystem and loyal customer base may mitigate some of this impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong market position and AI developments, while others indicate a higher probability of a fall due to competition and regulatory scrutiny.

Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, considering the previous predictions and the fact that Apple has a strong ecosystem and user base, the impact might be limited. Many models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising, citing Apple's strong position, positive investor sentiment, and potential AI developments. Given the mixed nature of the news and the trend of others' beliefs, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Oracle's efforts in the cloud and AI sector rather than directly mentioning Apple. However, given the broader context and the mixed reactions expressed in previous predictions, the impact on Apple's stock must account for various factors including market sentiment, competitive pressures, and the robustness of Apple's ecosystem. There is some speculation that Oracle's moves might indirectly affect investor perception of the technology sector as a whole. Previous predictions for Apple have oscillated widely, reflecting different views on regulatory challenges, AI developments, and competitive threats.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
