(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app developers. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance of stability or slight growth following this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio and that Buffett's team has invested in Apple for its AI capabilities. While Berkshire Hathaway recently reduced its stake in Apple, the news emphasizes that Apple remains its largest holding with 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The fact that Buffett's investment decisions are widely respected suggests that Apple's stock might be viewed positively by other investors due to this validation. It's likely to create positive investor sentiment. The news emphasizes that Apple's AI strategy has been implemented with the integration of AI features such as writing enhancement tools, priority notifications, and Siri's makeover and the integration with ChatGPT.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system.  Without access to the full article, it's impossible to gauge the severity of the potential consequences.  However, regulatory investigations often lead to uncertainty in the market. While a significant fine or mandated changes could negatively impact Apple's stock price, the probe's impact may be minimal if the investigation finds no wrongdoing or results in minor changes.  Given the lack of detail, it's reasonable to assume a relatively neutral market reaction, leaning slightly towards a negative impact due to the inherent uncertainty and potential negative publicity associated with regulatory scrutiny.  The probability of a stock price rise is thus assigned a lower value compared to the probability of a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace. This could potentially divert revenue away from Apple's App Store, which is a significant source of income for Apple. However, the impact might be limited as Apple still has a strong ecosystem and user base. The market might react negatively to the potential loss of control and revenue, but the overall effect is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, the impact of such probes can be uncertain and may not necessarily lead to a significant drop in stock price. Given the uncertainty and the fact that both companies have faced regulatory challenges before, the probability of a significant stock price move in either direction is difficult to predict with high confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing challenge to Apple\u2019s App Store dominance by introducing third-party games, which could potentially shift revenue away from Apple\u2019s ecosystem. However, given that previous court rulings have favored Apple and the company maintains a strong position in mobile markets with a loyal customer base, the overall market impact may be more limited than initially perceived. The high-value branding and robust ecosystem of Apple could mitigate adverse effects from the competitive pressure and regulatory scrutiny mentioned in the news. Therefore, while there is some potential for negative stock movement, the chances of a rise remain significant due to Apple's established market strength and resilience in face of competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's continued confidence in Apple as his largest holding, even after trimming the position. The article emphasizes Apple's proactive approach and investment in AI across its products, including new AI features in Apple Intelligence and Siri's integration with ChatGPT. Considering Buffett's reputation as a value investor and Apple's strong presence in the AI space, this news is likely to be viewed positively by investors, boosting investor confidence., I will consider others' prediction to balance my decision. Despite recent trimming of posititon in AAPL, it remains No.1 of BRK portfolio. Many models predict that the stock price will rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystem and operating system introduces uncertainty.  While the full details are unavailable, regulatory investigations often cause market volatility.  However, Apple's size and established position suggest the impact might be limited unless the investigation reveals significant wrongdoing.  Considering previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion.  Some models emphasize Apple's strong position and positive investor sentiment (Buffett's investment), while others highlight the risks associated with regulatory uncertainty.  The lack of detail in the headline makes a precise prediction difficult.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and potential for negative press associated with the probe, but acknowledging the strong underlying fundamentals of Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace, which could potentially impact Apple's App Store revenue. However, Apple's strong ecosystem and user base may mitigate some of this impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong position and potential AI developments, while others indicate a higher probability of a fall due to regulatory scrutiny and competition. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the previous predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to Apple's robust ecosystem and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current challenges and opportunities, highlighting a 'fork in the road year' for the company. Analysts at Wedbush believe that the panic around Apple's stock is overdone and maintain an 'Outperform' rating with a $325 price target. They emphasize that Apple's AI strategy, including the rollout of Apple Intelligence, will drive growth in the coming years. However, concerns about iPhone sales and hardware upgrades have been raised by other analysts. Given these mixed perspectives, the stock price movement is uncertain but slightly more inclined towards a positive outlook due to the AI strategy and growth potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, considering the previous predictions and the fact that Apple has a strong ecosystem and user base, the impact might be limited. The probabilities of stock price movement are estimated based on the analysis of the news and the trend of others' beliefs, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or slightly negative reaction due to the uncertainty and potential negative publicity associated with regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Since the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc., it may not have a significant direct influence on AAPL's stock price. However, given the broader context of market dynamics and investor sentiments, there's a moderate likelihood of a positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is intensifying competition with Apple by introducing third-party games, which could threaten Apple's App Store revenue. However, previous court rulings have mostly favored Apple, and the company retains a strong ecosystem with a loyal customer base. Additionally, investor sentiment appears optimistic due to Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple, highlighting confidence in the company's long-term prospects. While regulatory scrutiny and competition create some risk, the overall fundamentals and market position of Apple suggest a greater probability of stock price stability or slight growth rather than decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple as an AI play, despite a slight reduction in his holdings. This is generally positive, as Buffett's investments often signal strong underlying value. The article emphasizes Apple's advancements in AI, integration of AI features (Apple Intelligence and Siri with ChatGPT), and its massive user base (2.2 billion devices), suggesting significant potential for AI distribution and growth. The previous round's predictions show a positive sentiment, with most models predicting a rise. Taking all of this into consideration, the likelihood of a stock price increase is elevated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about the UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystem is a negative factor, introducing uncertainty and potential for negative publicity.  However, the lack of detail in the available headline and the premium nature of the full article prevent a precise assessment of the severity.  The previous predictions are mixed.  Some models highlight Apple's strong position, AI investments (and Buffett's continued holding, albeit reduced), arguing for a higher probability of a price rise. Others emphasize the regulatory uncertainty and potential negative impacts, predicting a higher likelihood of a price fall.  Considering the overall situation, the weight of evidence suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the inherent uncertainty of regulatory probes.  However, Apple's resilience and market dominance means the fall is likely to be moderate.  The consistent predictions of a rise in the models considering external factors (like Buffett's investment and Apple's AI efforts) are important to consider and help mitigate the negative effect of the investigation news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' challenge to Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace, which could potentially impact Apple's revenue from the App Store. However, Apple's strong ecosystem and loyal customer base may mitigate some of this impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong market position and AI developments, while others indicate a higher probability of a fall due to competition and regulatory scrutiny. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the previous predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to Apple's robust ecosystem and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, considering the previous predictions and the fact that Apple has a strong ecosystem and user base, the impact might be limited. Many models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising, citing Apple's strong position, positive investor sentiment, and potential AI developments. Given the mixed nature of the news and the trend of others' beliefs, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Oracle's efforts in the cloud and AI sector rather than directly mentioning Apple. However, given the broader context and the mixed reactions expressed in previous predictions, the impact on Apple's stock must account for various factors including market sentiment, competitive pressures, and the robustness of Apple's ecosystem. There is some speculation that Oracle's moves might indirectly affect investor perception of the technology sector as a whole. Previous predictions for Apple have oscillated widely, reflecting different views on regulatory challenges, AI developments, and competitive threats.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
