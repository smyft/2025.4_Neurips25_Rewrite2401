(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors\nNews Content: Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025.

The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI advancements in its products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both Buffett's investment decisions and Apple's technological innovations may lead to an increase in stock price. However, since there was a recent reduction in Berkshire's position in Apple, there may be some caution among investors, tempering the overall enthusiasm. Thus, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. While the government's request to host and potentially pre-install the GOV.in app suite might seem beneficial in terms of market access in India, Apple's reluctance suggests concerns about data privacy, security, and brand integrity, which are central to its business model, potentially impacting customer trust and ultimately affecting long-term revenues globally. The fact that the government might resort to legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance creates uncertainty and potential regulatory risk. Also the prior example of Russia does not indicate apples preference on the matter. Therefore, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling because the news creates uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Trump's statement expressing support for American tech companies against EU antitrust actions could be interpreted positively by investors.  This is because it suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressure on Apple and reduced risk of future large fines. However, the news is not a guarantee of reduced regulatory scrutiny. The article highlights that the US government is also actively pursuing anti-trust investigations into Big Tech.  Therefore, while Trump's statement may provide a short-term boost, the overall impact is uncertain.  The probability of a price increase is higher than a price decrease due to the potential for lowered regulatory risk, but the ongoing US investigations limit the potential upside.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his portfolio's focus on AI-driven companies. Apple's strong position in AI, with its Apple Intelligence software and integration of AI features across its devices, is seen as a positive indicator for future growth. Despite Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, the company remains its largest holding, suggesting continued confidence. The overall positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strategic advancements in this area are likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake could introduce some uncertainty, though the impact is likely minimal given Apple's strong fundamentals and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Mark Zuckerberg may be right about Apple's lack of innovation, but the article argues that this shouldn't matter to investors. The neutral to positive tone of the article implies that despite the potential criticism of Apple's innovation, the company's stock might not be significantly affected negatively. Given that the article does not present overwhelmingly negative information about Apple's prospects, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price has a higher chance of remaining stable or rising rather than falling. However, the mention of a lack of innovation could still concern some investors, preventing a strong positive reaction. Therefore, a cautious estimate would be a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising or staying stable than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings season, with a focus on Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. The article highlights the potential impact of President Trump's policies on the tech industry, including tariffs, export controls, and antitrust regulations. The article also mentions the importance of AI revenue and spending, as well as the fate of the CHIPS Act. Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and their potential impact on the tech industry, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the article also mentions that Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with President Trump, which could potentially mitigate the negative effects of Trump's policies on the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook on the stock, implying that buying the stock during the bull market could potentially lead to significant gains. Since the content of the news isn't fully provided, we base the analysis on the headline which has a bullish tone. However, without specific details on the market conditions, potential impacts on the company's financials, or industry context, it is challenging to make a precise probability estimation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple, particularly in the context of its advancements in AI technology, which may bolster investor confidence. Despite previous reductions in Berkshire's stake, Apple remains a significant holding and is involved in innovations that can enhance its business model. The overall positive sentiment surrounding AI applications in Apple's products, coupled with Buffett's support, suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price increasing. However, caution persists due to reduced stake and ongoing market volatility. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. India's request for Apple to host and possibly pre-install the GOV.in app suite raises significant concerns regarding data privacy, security, and brand integrity, central to Apple's business model. Apple's reported reluctance to cooperate, combined with the government's threat of legal actions or policy directives, creates uncertainty and potential regulatory risks. Similar reluctance to comply exhibited by Google amplifies the situation's complexity. India is a critical market, the impact on Apple's business operations could be detrimental but given the case in Russia in 2021, it is also possible for apple to give consumers the option to install the applications. Considering the existing predictions, I believe the negative impact of this news outweighs the potential for positive outcomes. Therefore, I am giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. However, I don't think it will significantly affect the stock, therefore I am only leaning slightly towards the price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's criticism of EU antitrust actions against US tech companies, specifically mentioning Apple's significant fine. While Trump's statement might offer short-term relief by suggesting a potential reduction in future regulatory pressure under a hypothetical second term, this is highly uncertain and depends heavily on a Trump victory and his actual policy implementation, which is far from guaranteed.  The ongoing US antitrust investigations against Apple are a significant countervailing force.  The previous predictions show a range of views, with several models leaning slightly towards a rise, but no strong consensus.  Considering the uncertainty surrounding Trump's influence and the continuing US investigations, a neutral position is most reasonable.  The large fines levied already *have* impacted Apple's bottom line, something the market will already have priced in. Therefore, the probability of a price increase isn't significantly higher than the probability of a decrease, and any market reaction is likely to be relatively muted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, accounting for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's investments, despite recent reductions. Apple's strategic focus on AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence and integration of AI features across its devices, is portrayed positively. The article underscores Apple's potential to become a major AI distributor given its vast user base. While Berkshire's partial divestment introduces some caution, the overall sentiment is bullish due to Apple's strong fundamentals and AI advancements. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, but the majority lean towards a positive outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

The article highlights the potential impact of President Trump's policies on the tech industry, including tariffs, export controls, and antitrust regulations.
