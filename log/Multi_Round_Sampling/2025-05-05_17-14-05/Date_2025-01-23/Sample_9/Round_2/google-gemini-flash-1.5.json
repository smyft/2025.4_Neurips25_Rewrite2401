(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI advancements in its products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both Buffett's investment decisions and Apple's technological innovations may lead to an increase in stock price. However, since there was a recent reduction in Berkshire's position in Apple, there may be some caution among investors, tempering the overall enthusiasm. Thus, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. While the government's request to host and potentially pre-install the GOV.in app suite might seem beneficial in terms of market access in India, Apple's reluctance suggests concerns about data privacy, security, and brand integrity, which are central to its business model, potentially impacting customer trust and ultimately affecting long-term revenues globally. The fact that the government might resort to legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance creates uncertainty and potential regulatory risk. Also the prior example of Russia does not indicate apples preference on the matter. Therefore, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling because the news creates uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Trump's statement expressing support for American tech companies against EU antitrust actions could be interpreted positively by investors.  This is because it suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressure on Apple and reduced risk of future large fines. However, the news is not a guarantee of reduced regulatory scrutiny. The article highlights that the US government is also actively pursuing anti-trust investigations into Big Tech.  Therefore, while Trump's statement may provide a short-term boost, the overall impact is uncertain.  The probability of a price increase is higher than a price decrease due to the potential for lowered regulatory risk, but the ongoing US investigations limit the potential upside.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his portfolio's focus on AI-driven companies. Apple's strong position in AI, with its Apple Intelligence software and integration of AI features across its devices, is seen as a positive indicator for future growth. Despite Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, the company remains its largest holding, suggesting continued confidence. The overall positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strategic advancements in this area are likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake could introduce some uncertainty, though the impact is likely minimal given Apple's strong fundamentals and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Mark Zuckerberg may be right about Apple's lack of innovation, but the article argues that this shouldn't matter to investors. The neutral to positive tone of the article implies that despite the potential criticism of Apple's innovation, the company's stock might not be significantly affected negatively. Given that the article does not present overwhelmingly negative information about Apple's prospects, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price has a higher chance of remaining stable or rising rather than falling. However, the mention of a lack of innovation could still concern some investors, preventing a strong positive reaction. Therefore, a cautious estimate would be a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising or staying stable than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings season, with a focus on Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. The article highlights the potential impact of President Trump's policies on the tech industry, including tariffs, export controls, and antitrust regulations. The article also mentions the importance of AI revenue and spending, as well as the fate of the CHIPS Act. Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and their potential impact on the tech industry, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the article also mentions that Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with President Trump, which could potentially mitigate the negative effects of Trump's policies on the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook on the stock, implying that buying the stock during the bull market could potentially lead to significant gains. Since the content of the news isn't fully provided, we base the analysis on the headline which has a bullish tone. However, without specific details on the market conditions, potential impacts on the company's financials, or industry context, it is challenging to make a precise probability estimation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple, particularly in the context of its advancements in AI technology, which may bolster investor confidence. Despite previous reductions in Berkshire's stake, Apple remains a significant holding and is involved in innovations that can enhance its business model. The overall positive sentiment surrounding AI applications in Apple's products, coupled with Buffett's support, suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price increasing. However, caution persists due to reduced stake and ongoing market volatility. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. India's request for Apple to host and possibly pre-install the GOV.in app suite raises significant concerns regarding data privacy, security, and brand integrity, central to Apple's business model. Apple's reported reluctance to cooperate, combined with the government's threat of legal actions or policy directives, creates uncertainty and potential regulatory risks. Similar reluctance to comply exhibited by Google amplifies the situation's complexity. India is a critical market, the impact on Apple's business operations could be detrimental but given the case in Russia in 2021, it is also possible for apple to give consumers the option to install the applications. Considering the existing predictions, I believe the negative impact of this news outweighs the potential for positive outcomes. Therefore, I am giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. However, I don't think it will significantly affect the stock, therefore I am only leaning slightly towards the price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's criticism of EU antitrust actions against US tech companies, specifically mentioning Apple's significant fine. While Trump's statement might offer short-term relief by suggesting a potential reduction in future regulatory pressure under a hypothetical second term, this is highly uncertain and depends heavily on a Trump victory and his actual policy implementation, which is far from guaranteed.  The ongoing US antitrust investigations against Apple are a significant countervailing force.  The previous predictions show a range of views, with several models leaning slightly towards a rise, but no strong consensus.  Considering the uncertainty surrounding Trump's influence and the continuing US investigations, a neutral position is most reasonable.  The large fines levied already *have* impacted Apple's bottom line, something the market will already have priced in. Therefore, the probability of a price increase isn't significantly higher than the probability of a decrease, and any market reaction is likely to be relatively muted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, accounting for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's investments, despite recent reductions. Apple's strategic focus on AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence and integration of AI features across its devices, is portrayed positively. The article underscores Apple's potential to become a major AI distributor given its vast user base. While Berkshire's partial divestment introduces some caution, the overall sentiment is bullish due to Apple's strong fundamentals and AI advancements. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, but the majority lean towards a positive outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

The article highlights the potential impact of President Trump's policies on the tech industry, including tariffs, export controls, and antitrust regulations.
