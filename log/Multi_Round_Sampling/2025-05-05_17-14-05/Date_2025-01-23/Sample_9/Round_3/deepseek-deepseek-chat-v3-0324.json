(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI advancements in its products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both Buffett's investment decisions and Apple's technological innovations may lead to an increase in stock price. However, since there was a recent reduction in Berkshire's position in Apple, there may be some caution among investors, tempering the overall enthusiasm. Thus, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. While the government's request to host and potentially pre-install the GOV.in app suite might seem beneficial in terms of market access in India, Apple's reluctance suggests concerns about data privacy, security, and brand integrity, which are central to its business model, potentially impacting customer trust and ultimately affecting long-term revenues globally. The fact that the government might resort to legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance creates uncertainty and potential regulatory risk. Also the prior example of Russia does not indicate apples preference on the matter. Therefore, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling because the news creates uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Trump's statement expressing support for American tech companies against EU antitrust actions could be interpreted positively by investors.  This is because it suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressure on Apple and reduced risk of future large fines. However, the news is not a guarantee of reduced regulatory scrutiny. The article highlights that the US government is also actively pursuing anti-trust investigations into Big Tech.  Therefore, while Trump's statement may provide a short-term boost, the overall impact is uncertain.  The probability of a price increase is higher than a price decrease due to the potential for lowered regulatory risk, but the ongoing US investigations limit the potential upside.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his portfolio's focus on AI-driven companies. Apple's strong position in AI, with its Apple Intelligence software and integration of AI features across its devices, is seen as a positive indicator for future growth. Despite Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, the company remains its largest holding, suggesting continued confidence. The overall positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strategic advancements in this area are likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake could introduce some uncertainty, though the impact is likely minimal given Apple's strong fundamentals and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Mark Zuckerberg may be right about Apple's lack of innovation, but the article argues that this shouldn't matter to investors. The neutral to positive tone of the article implies that despite the potential criticism of Apple's innovation, the company's stock might not be significantly affected negatively. Given that the article does not present overwhelmingly negative information about Apple's prospects, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price has a higher chance of remaining stable or rising rather than falling. However, the mention of a lack of innovation could still concern some investors, preventing a strong positive reaction. Therefore, a cautious estimate would be a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising or staying stable than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings season, with a focus on Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. The article highlights the potential impact of President Trump's policies on the tech industry, including tariffs, export controls, and antitrust regulations. The article also mentions the importance of AI revenue and spending, as well as the fate of the CHIPS Act. Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and their potential impact on the tech industry, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the article also mentions that Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with President Trump, which could potentially mitigate the negative effects of Trump's policies on the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook on the stock, implying that buying the stock during the bull market could potentially lead to significant gains. Since the content of the news isn't fully provided, we base the analysis on the headline which has a bullish tone. However, without specific details on the market conditions, potential impacts on the company's financials, or industry context, it is challenging to make a precise probability estimation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple, particularly in the context of its advancements in AI technology, which may bolster investor confidence. Despite previous reductions in Berkshire's stake, Apple remains a significant holding and is involved in innovations that can enhance its business model. The overall positive sentiment surrounding AI applications in Apple's products, coupled with Buffett's support, suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price increasing. However, caution persists due to reduced stake and ongoing market volatility. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential conflict between the Indian government and Apple. India's request for Apple to host and possibly pre-install the GOV.in app suite raises significant concerns regarding data privacy, security, and brand integrity, central to Apple's business model. Apple's reported reluctance to cooperate, combined with the government's threat of legal actions or policy directives, creates uncertainty and potential regulatory risks. Similar reluctance to comply exhibited by Google amplifies the situation's complexity. India is a critical market, the impact on Apple's business operations could be detrimental but given the case in Russia in 2021, it is also possible for apple to give consumers the option to install the applications. Considering the existing predictions, I believe the negative impact of this news outweighs the potential for positive outcomes. Therefore, I am giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. However, I don't think it will significantly affect the stock, therefore I am only leaning slightly towards the price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's criticism of EU antitrust actions against US tech companies, specifically mentioning Apple's significant fine. While Trump's statement might offer short-term relief by suggesting a potential reduction in future regulatory pressure under a hypothetical second term, this is highly uncertain and depends heavily on a Trump victory and his actual policy implementation, which is far from guaranteed.  The ongoing US antitrust investigations against Apple are a significant countervailing force.  The previous predictions show a range of views, with several models leaning slightly towards a rise, but no strong consensus.  Considering the uncertainty surrounding Trump's influence and the continuing US investigations, a neutral position is most reasonable.  The large fines levied already *have* impacted Apple's bottom line, something the market will already have priced in. Therefore, the probability of a price increase isn't significantly higher than the probability of a decrease, and any market reaction is likely to be relatively muted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, accounting for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's investments, despite recent reductions. Apple's strategic focus on AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence and integration of AI features across its devices, is portrayed positively. The article underscores Apple's potential to become a major AI distributor given its vast user base. While Berkshire's partial divestment introduces some caution, the overall sentiment is bullish due to Apple's strong fundamentals and AI advancements. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, but the majority lean towards a positive outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings season, with a focus on Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. The article highlights the potential impact of President Trump's policies on the tech industry, including tariffs, export controls, and antitrust regulations. While there is uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies, Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with President Trump, which could potentially mitigate the negative effects of Trump's policies on the company. Additionally, the article mentions the importance of AI revenue and spending, which could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the mixed information, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, particularly focusing on its AI advancements. Buffett's continued faith in Apple, exemplified by its substantial share in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, generally boosts investor confidence. Despite recent reductions in Berkshire's position, which could induce some caution among investors, the overall sentiment regarding Apple's potential in AI and its ongoing technological innovations is positive. Previous models show a general trend of optimism about Apple's stock price, with a majority leaning towards a rise. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, reflecting confidence in both Buffett's investment choices and Apple's strategic direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, the Indian government's request, and potential compulsion, to host the GOV.in app suite could lead to greater market penetration and access to a large user base in India. However, Apple's reluctance, likely driven by concerns about data privacy, security, and control over its App Store ecosystem, poses a risk. Legal action or policy directives from the Indian government introduce regulatory uncertainty. The comparison to Apple's actions in Russia suggests a possible resolution where consumers are given a choice to install the apps, minimizing the negative impact. Considering Google's similar reluctance, this seems to be an industry-wide issue, possibly lessening the direct impact on Apple alone. Looking at previous predictions, there seems to be a slight trend towards increased pessimism. Therefore, I will slightly favor a decrease in probability of stock price rising and increase probability of stock price falling. However, considering the India market is not a critical one for Apple I don't think this news will impact Apple a lot. Therefore, I only made a minor change.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's criticism of EU antitrust actions against US tech companies, specifically highlighting Apple's large fine.  While Trump's support might seem positive, suggesting a potential easing of future regulatory pressure under a hypothetical second term, this is highly uncertain.  His statement depends entirely on a Trump victory and his actual policy execution.  The ongoing US antitrust investigations against Apple are a significant counterbalancing factor. The prior fines *have* already impacted Apple's bottom line, which the market has likely already absorbed. Previous predictions show no strong consensus, with probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 for a price rise. Considering the uncertainties surrounding Trump's potential influence and the persistent US investigations, and the already priced-in effects of the EU fines, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted. A neutral stance is most reasonable. The news itself provides minimal new information significantly impacting Apple's valuation. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is only slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the market's likely limited reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, accounting for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's investments, despite recent reductions.

The mixture of opinions from different models suggests a diverse set of factors influencing the stock price movement. Models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 lean towards a positive outlook driven by ongoing innovations and strategic positions, whereas models like google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 highlight potential uncertainties and risks such as regulatory issues. The overall consensus from previous models shows a slight bias towards the stock price rising, influenced by investor confidence, technological leadership, and strategic positions within AI. Despite varied factors and uncertainties, the general sentiment appears marginally positive.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
