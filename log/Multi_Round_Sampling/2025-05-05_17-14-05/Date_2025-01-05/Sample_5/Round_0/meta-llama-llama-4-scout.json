The article seems to be prompting an evaluation of Apple's stock for potential buyers rather than announcing a specific event or financial result. Therefore, it's unlikely to cause a drastic change in stock price immediately. Given the neutral nature of the headline, I estimate a slight bias towards a positive outlook due to the curiosity and potential interest it might generate among investors.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Should You Buy Apple Stock Right Now in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
