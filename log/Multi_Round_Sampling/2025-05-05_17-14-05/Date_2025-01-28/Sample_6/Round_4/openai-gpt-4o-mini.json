(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant concern over the impact of a low-cost AI model introduced by DeepSeek on major tech companies like Apple. Although the Nasdaq futures are pointing higher, which suggests some recovery after a sell-off, the fundamental fear surrounding AI spending and valuation could weigh on Apple as it reports earnings soon. The emerging competition from DeepSeek raises doubts about the sustainability of spending on AI among leading firms, including Apple. The probabilities reflect the uncertainty surrounding market reactions to the news and upcoming earnings.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Initially, the DeepSeek AI model sparked concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, potentially negatively impacting companies like Apple who are actively investing in AI. However, the analysis from T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that the DeepSeek innovation could actually *increase* compute intensity (GPU usage) in the medium term, which could *benefit* companies developing and deploying AI. The article also points out that the future of AI spending depends on the specific business models of each company. Given that Apple is a major player in AI and has significant resources, it's likely they will adapt and continue investing in AI. The \"easing\" of the tech selloff is also a positive signal. Furthermore, while the news mentions Nvidia benefiting from increasing compute needs, it is less direct and might not affect Apple's stock price as much as the immediate concerns regarding Apple's AI spending. Overall, the mixed signals create uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to the tech selloff easing, potential medium term benefits from DeepSeek, and Apple's diverse business model.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires using Hargreaves Lansdown's platform.  While Apple (AAPL) isn't directly mentioned in the top holdings of these millionaires' stock portfolios, a significant detail is that the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, one of their most popular funds, holds a substantial amount of AAPL stock.  This fund's strong performance (nearly 38% over the past year) and its inclusion in the portfolios of high-net-worth individuals indirectly suggests positive sentiment towards technology stocks, including AAPL. However, the news is about UK investor behavior and doesn't directly address factors that might specifically drive Apple's stock price. Therefore, the impact of this news on AAPL's price is likely to be minimal.  The probabilities are weighted more towards a neutral outcome, reflecting the indirect and tangential relationship between the news and AAPL's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment preferences of UK's ISA millionaires, highlighting a preference for blue-chip companies and diversified funds, including those with exposure to global technology firms like Apple (AAPL). The Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which includes AAPL as a top holding, has seen significant growth (up 38% over the past year). This indicates sustained investor confidence in technology stocks, including Apple. However, the news does not directly mention any Apple-specific developments, so the impact is indirect. Given the positive performance of the fund and the general trend of ISA millionaires favoring reliable, long-term investments, it is reasonable to infer a neutral to slightly positive sentiment for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans, causing a sell-off in technology stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Nasdaq futures have inched up on Tuesday, indicating a potential recovery. The emergence of DeepSeek's AI model has raised concerns about the AI spending outlook for US tech companies, but some analysts consider the sell-off an over-reaction. Apple's stock price may face short-term volatility due to these concerns, but the company's strong position in the tech industry and its upcoming earnings report could influence its stock price positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, a tailored version of ChatGPT for US government agencies, and its potential impact on the tech industry. The article also mentions the recent success of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its potential to disrupt the AI arms race. However, some analysts believe that heightened competition will lead to increased industry spending and innovation, which could benefit companies like Apple. The article specifically mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off, suggesting that the company's platform may benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a complex environment for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model raises concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, leading to a temporary sell-off, the recovery in Nasdaq futures hints at a potential market rebound. Furthermore, positive comments from OpenAI's CEO about DeepSeek's capabilities suggest that competition may drive innovation rather than hinder spending. Analysts vary in their views, but the consensus leans towards a mixed outlook for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rising compared to falling, as the immediate negative impacts may lessen, especially with upcoming earnings reports likely influencing investor sentiment positively.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The initial DeepSeek AI news triggered a tech sell-off, suggesting potential concerns about AI spending efficiency and overconcentration, which initially hurt the stock. However, the subsequent analysis from T. Rowe Price points to a possible increase in compute intensity and GPU utilization in the medium term, potentially benefiting, or at least not hurting, AI-focused companies like Apple. The 'easing' of the sell-off further indicates a possible recovery. The article also highlights the business model impacting decisions of larger companies like apple. Overall, the initial worries seem to be counterbalanced by the potential positive medium-term effects and market recovery. Considering the previous round prediction, which has the prediction of stock price rising on the high end, the current round maintains the same sentiment with slight adjustment downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment strategies of UK ISA millionaires, revealing a preference for established, dividend-paying companies and diversified global funds.  While Apple (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned as a top holding, the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, a popular fund among these millionaires, holds AAPL and has performed exceptionally well (+38% year-over-year). This indirectly suggests positive sentiment towards technology stocks like AAPL. However, the news is primarily about UK investment trends and doesn't offer direct insight into factors that would specifically impact Apple's stock price.  The indirect nature of the news and its limited relevance to Apple's immediate prospects suggest a muted effect on AAPL's price.  Therefore, the probabilities are tilted slightly toward a neutral to slightly positive outlook, reflecting the indirect positive sentiment but acknowledging the lack of direct impact from the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios and blue-chip companies, including those in the technology sector. Apple (AAPL) is indirectly mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has seen strong performance (up 38% over the past year). This suggests sustained investor confidence in technology stocks, including Apple. However, the news does not provide any direct Apple-specific developments, so the impact is indirect and likely minimal. Given the positive performance of the fund and the general trend of ISA millionaires favoring reliable, long-term investments, the sentiment for AAPL is neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed but slightly optimistic outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans, causing a sell-off in technology stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Nasdaq futures have inched up on Tuesday, indicating a potential recovery. The emergence of DeepSeek's AI model has raised concerns about the AI spending outlook for US tech companies, but some analysts consider the sell-off an over-reaction. Apple's stock price may face short-term volatility due to these concerns, but the company's strong position in the tech industry and its upcoming earnings report could influence its stock price positively. Given the mixed signals and uncertainty surrounding market reactions to the news and upcoming earnings, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be 0.52 and falling to be 0.48.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov and its potential impact on the tech industry, as well as the recent success of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup.

While there is no specific news affecting Apple Inc., it is noted that the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which includes Apple as a significant holding, has experienced notable gains. This suggests that there is sustained investor confidence in technology stocks, including Apple. However, since the core information does not directly relate to specific developments within Apple, the impact on Apple\u2019s stock price remains indirect.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a complex environment for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Although the emergence of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model has raised concerns about potential reductions in AI spending from major tech companies, which initially contributed to a sell-off in the tech sector, there are signs of recovery with Nasdaq futures pointing higher. Analysts suggest that the competition from DeepSeek could lead to increased innovation and efficiency in the sector, potentially benefiting companies like Apple. The mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report also contribute to uncertainty, but overall, the trends indicate a slightly more favorable outlook for AAPL's stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on Big Tech's AI spending. Initially, this caused a tech sell-off, raising concerns about overspending on AI. However, T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that DeepSeek's innovation could increase compute intensity and GPU utilization in the medium term which would be benifical for AAPL. The easing of the tech sell-off further points to potential recovery. Previous predictions also suggest a slightly positive to neutral outlook. Taking all of this in account, I believe the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment habits of wealthy UK investors, revealing a preference for established, dividend-paying companies and diversified global funds.  While Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned, the strong performance of the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (holding AAPL) indirectly suggests continued confidence in tech stocks. However, the link is weak; the news doesn't offer direct insights into Apple-specific factors.  Previous model predictions show a wide range, from a strong belief in a price rise to near neutrality. Considering the indirect and tangential nature of the news affecting AAPL, I lean toward a neutral probability, slightly favoring a price rise due to the positive performance of the tech fund indirectly linked to AAPL. The overall market sentiment and Apple's upcoming earnings will be much more impactful than this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios and blue-chip companies, including those in the technology sector.

Although there has been a sell-off in tech stocks, the Nasdaq futures indicate a potential recovery. Analysts suggest that the reaction to the DeepSeek model may have been an overreaction, and its introduction could stimulate greater innovation and efficiency, ultimately benefiting established firms like Apple. Upcoming earnings reports could also bolster investor sentiment. Therefore, while concerns around reduced AI spending linger, the overall trend points toward a slightly better outlook for Apple's stock, leading to a higher probability of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI on Big Tech.
