(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant concern over the impact of a low-cost AI model introduced by DeepSeek on major tech companies like Apple. Although the Nasdaq futures are pointing higher, which suggests some recovery after a sell-off, the fundamental fear surrounding AI spending and valuation could weigh on Apple as it reports earnings soon. The emerging competition from DeepSeek raises doubts about the sustainability of spending on AI among leading firms, including Apple. The probabilities reflect the uncertainty surrounding market reactions to the news and upcoming earnings.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Initially, the DeepSeek AI model sparked concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, potentially negatively impacting companies like Apple who are actively investing in AI. However, the analysis from T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that the DeepSeek innovation could actually *increase* compute intensity (GPU usage) in the medium term, which could *benefit* companies developing and deploying AI. The article also points out that the future of AI spending depends on the specific business models of each company. Given that Apple is a major player in AI and has significant resources, it's likely they will adapt and continue investing in AI. The \"easing\" of the tech selloff is also a positive signal. Furthermore, while the news mentions Nvidia benefiting from increasing compute needs, it is less direct and might not affect Apple's stock price as much as the immediate concerns regarding Apple's AI spending. Overall, the mixed signals create uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to the tech selloff easing, potential medium term benefits from DeepSeek, and Apple's diverse business model.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires using Hargreaves Lansdown's platform.  While Apple (AAPL) isn't directly mentioned in the top holdings of these millionaires' stock portfolios, a significant detail is that the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, one of their most popular funds, holds a substantial amount of AAPL stock.  This fund's strong performance (nearly 38% over the past year) and its inclusion in the portfolios of high-net-worth individuals indirectly suggests positive sentiment towards technology stocks, including AAPL. However, the news is about UK investor behavior and doesn't directly address factors that might specifically drive Apple's stock price. Therefore, the impact of this news on AAPL's price is likely to be minimal.  The probabilities are weighted more towards a neutral outcome, reflecting the indirect and tangential relationship between the news and AAPL's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment preferences of UK's ISA millionaires, highlighting a preference for blue-chip companies and diversified funds, including those with exposure to global technology firms like Apple (AAPL). The Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which includes AAPL as a top holding, has seen significant growth (up 38% over the past year). This indicates sustained investor confidence in technology stocks, including Apple. However, the news does not directly mention any Apple-specific developments, so the impact is indirect. Given the positive performance of the fund and the general trend of ISA millionaires favoring reliable, long-term investments, it is reasonable to infer a neutral to slightly positive sentiment for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans, causing a sell-off in technology stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Nasdaq futures have inched up on Tuesday, indicating a potential recovery. The emergence of DeepSeek's AI model has raised concerns about the AI spending outlook for US tech companies, but some analysts consider the sell-off an over-reaction. Apple's stock price may face short-term volatility due to these concerns, but the company's strong position in the tech industry and its upcoming earnings report could influence its stock price positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, a tailored version of ChatGPT for US government agencies, and its potential impact on the tech industry. The article also mentions the recent success of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its potential to disrupt the AI arms race. However, some analysts believe that heightened competition will lead to increased industry spending and innovation, which could benefit companies like Apple. The article specifically mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off, suggesting that the company's platform may benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a complex environment for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model raises concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, leading to a temporary sell-off, the recovery in Nasdaq futures hints at a potential market rebound. Furthermore, positive comments from OpenAI's CEO about DeepSeek's capabilities suggest that competition may drive innovation rather than hinder spending. Analysts vary in their views, but the consensus leans towards a mixed outlook for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rising compared to falling, as the immediate negative impacts may lessen, especially with upcoming earnings reports likely influencing investor sentiment positively.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The initial DeepSeek AI news triggered a tech sell-off, suggesting potential concerns about AI spending efficiency and overconcentration, which initially hurt the stock. However, the subsequent analysis from T. Rowe Price points to a possible increase in compute intensity and GPU utilization in the medium term, potentially benefiting, or at least not hurting, AI-focused companies like Apple. The 'easing' of the sell-off further indicates a possible recovery. The article also highlights the business model impacting decisions of larger companies like apple. Overall, the initial worries seem to be counterbalanced by the potential positive medium-term effects and market recovery. Considering the previous round prediction, which has the prediction of stock price rising on the high end, the current round maintains the same sentiment with slight adjustment downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment strategies of UK ISA millionaires, revealing a preference for established, dividend-paying companies and diversified global funds.  While Apple (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned as a top holding, the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, a popular fund among these millionaires, holds AAPL and has performed exceptionally well (+38% year-over-year). This indirectly suggests positive sentiment towards technology stocks like AAPL. However, the news is primarily about UK investment trends and doesn't offer direct insight into factors that would specifically impact Apple's stock price.  The indirect nature of the news and its limited relevance to Apple's immediate prospects suggest a muted effect on AAPL's price.  Therefore, the probabilities are tilted slightly toward a neutral to slightly positive outlook, reflecting the indirect positive sentiment but acknowledging the lack of direct impact from the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios and blue-chip companies, including those in the technology sector. Apple (AAPL) is indirectly mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has seen strong performance (up 38% over the past year). This suggests sustained investor confidence in technology stocks, including Apple. However, the news does not provide any direct Apple-specific developments, so the impact is indirect and likely minimal. Given the positive performance of the fund and the general trend of ISA millionaires favoring reliable, long-term investments, the sentiment for AAPL is neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed but slightly optimistic outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans, causing a sell-off in technology stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Nasdaq futures have inched up on Tuesday, indicating a potential recovery. The emergence of DeepSeek's AI model has raised concerns about the AI spending outlook for US tech companies, but some analysts consider the sell-off an over-reaction. Apple's stock price may face short-term volatility due to these concerns, but the company's strong position in the tech industry and its upcoming earnings report could influence its stock price positively. Given the mixed signals and uncertainty surrounding market reactions to the news and upcoming earnings, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be 0.52 and falling to be 0.48.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov and its potential impact on the tech industry, as well as the recent success of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. Some analysts believe that heightened competition will lead to increased industry spending and innovation, which could benefit companies like Apple. The article specifically mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off, suggesting that the company's platform may benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. Considering the mixed signals in the news and the varying predictions from other models, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential benefits from increased competition and innovation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses investment patterns and portfolios of UK-based ISA millionaires, highlighting that they prefer blue-chip companies and diversified funds. While there is no specific news affecting Apple Inc., it is noted that the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which includes Apple as a significant holding, has experienced notable gains. This suggests that there is sustained investor confidence in technology stocks, including Apple. However, since the core information does not directly relate to specific developments within Apple, the impact on Apple\u2019s stock price remains indirect.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
