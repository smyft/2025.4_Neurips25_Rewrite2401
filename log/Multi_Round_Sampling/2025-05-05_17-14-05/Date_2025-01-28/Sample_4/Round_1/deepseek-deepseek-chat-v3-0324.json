(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\nNews Content: This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) : Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive sentiment regarding Apple Inc. due to an analyst's buy rating and raised price target, alongside expectations of revenue growth in Q4 and the implications of AI innovation. The reported increase in share price of 4% reflects optimism in the market. The potential for revenue growth in the Services segment and a robust outlook for new AI models further supports a bullish perspective. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the immediate positive impact of the analyst's report and potential growth outweighs these concerns. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Positively, Nasdaq futures are up slightly, indicating a potential rebound after the tech sell-off. However, the core driver of the sell-off is the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model that is directly impacting Apple as its app surpassed ChatGPT in downloads. The success of DeepSeek raises concerns about the potential for reduced spending on AI within the tech industry and places pressure on companies like Apple to demonstrate the value of their AI investments, specifically mentioned within the article related to earnings outlook. The article states this has been considered by U.S. President Donald Trump as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for American companies, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledging the impressiveness of the DeepSeek Model. Furthermore, Apple is reporting earnings this week, intensifying focus on its AI strategy. Though not explicitly stated, the success of the Chinese app may also reduce projected app download revenue, and also poses the prospect that Apple's products may fall behind more cheaply produced and equally capable AI software. Given the potential negative impact of DeepSeek's model alongside earnings coming this week, the probability of a price decrease or static movement is more elevated than a price rise. As such, a price decrease seems to be more likely in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) claims Apple held the top spot with a 17.4% market share in Q4, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and significant year-over-year decline in shipments.  This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a general decline in Apple's market share in China compared to the previous year.  The 4% price increase mentioned in the headline likely predates the publication of the full article, and may be attributed to other market factors unrelated to the reported data. The author also expresses skepticism regarding Apple's future performance compared to AI stocks, adding to a bearish sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the author's bearish viewpoint, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, though the conflicting data makes a definitive prediction challenging. The 4% price jump is likely a short-term blip and not solely reflective of the conflicting Chinese market data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth, with a 14% year-over-year increase, and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the stock is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. The overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling, and the iPhone's performance, a major revenue contributor, is under scrutiny due to skepticism around Apple Intelligence. Given these factors, the stock's movement post-earnings is likely to be influenced by the actual results and guidance, particularly regarding China sales and Services growth. The unchanged EPS estimates and stagnant top-line growth add to the uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Wall Street analysts believe Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is Warren Buffett's largest holding, is poised to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025. This optimistic outlook could drive the stock price up as it indicates strong confidence in the company's future performance, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the news also mentions a note of skepticism ('Here's Why I'm Not So Sure'), which might temper overly enthusiastic expectations. Overall, the positive sentiment from influential investors like Warren Buffett and supportive analyst forecasts could lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is one of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks that have shown solid gains in 2024. This suggests a positive trend for the company, which could lead to an increase in its stock price. The fact that these stocks have a disproportionate influence on the market-cap weighted Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes further supports the idea that Apple's stock price may rise due to this news. However, it's also possible that the stock price may not rise or may even fall due to various market and economic factors not mentioned in the news. Given the positive tone of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) might experience varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the probability leans slightly towards a positive stock movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
