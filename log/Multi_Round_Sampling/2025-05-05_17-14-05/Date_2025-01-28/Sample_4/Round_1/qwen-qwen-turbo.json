(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive sentiment regarding Apple Inc. due to an analyst's buy rating and raised price target, alongside expectations of revenue growth in Q4 and the implications of AI innovation. The reported increase in share price of 4% reflects optimism in the market. The potential for revenue growth in the Services segment and a robust outlook for new AI models further supports a bullish perspective. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the immediate positive impact of the analyst's report and potential growth outweighs these concerns. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Positively, Nasdaq futures are up slightly, indicating a potential rebound after the tech sell-off. However, the core driver of the sell-off is the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model that is directly impacting Apple as its app surpassed ChatGPT in downloads. The success of DeepSeek raises concerns about the potential for reduced spending on AI within the tech industry and places pressure on companies like Apple to demonstrate the value of their AI investments, specifically mentioned within the article related to earnings outlook. The article states this has been considered by U.S. President Donald Trump as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for American companies, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledging the impressiveness of the DeepSeek Model. Furthermore, Apple is reporting earnings this week, intensifying focus on its AI strategy. Though not explicitly stated, the success of the Chinese app may also reduce projected app download revenue, and also poses the prospect that Apple's products may fall behind more cheaply produced and equally capable AI software. Given the potential negative impact of DeepSeek's model alongside earnings coming this week, the probability of a price decrease or static movement is more elevated than a price rise. As such, a price decrease seems to be more likely in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) claims Apple held the top spot with a 17.4% market share in Q4, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and significant year-over-year decline in shipments.  This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a general decline in Apple's market share in China compared to the previous year.  The 4% price increase mentioned in the headline likely predates the publication of the full article, and may be attributed to other market factors unrelated to the reported data. The author also expresses skepticism regarding Apple's future performance compared to AI stocks, adding to a bearish sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the author's bearish viewpoint, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, though the conflicting data makes a definitive prediction challenging. The 4% price jump is likely a short-term blip and not solely reflective of the conflicting Chinese market data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth, with a 14% year-over-year increase, and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the stock is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. The overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling, and the iPhone's performance, a major revenue contributor, is under scrutiny due to skepticism around Apple Intelligence. Given these factors, the stock's movement post-earnings is likely to be influenced by the actual results and guidance, particularly regarding China sales and Services growth. The unchanged EPS estimates and stagnant top-line growth add to the uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Wall Street analysts believe Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is Warren Buffett's largest holding, is poised to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025. This optimistic outlook could drive the stock price up as it indicates strong confidence in the company's future performance, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the news also mentions a note of skepticism ('Here's Why I'm Not So Sure'), which might temper overly enthusiastic expectations. Overall, the positive sentiment from influential investors like Warren Buffett and supportive analyst forecasts could lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is one of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks that have shown solid gains in 2024. This suggests a positive trend for the company, which could lead to an increase in its stock price. The fact that these stocks have a disproportionate influence on the market-cap weighted Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes further supports the idea that Apple's stock price may rise due to this news. However, it's also possible that the stock price may not rise or may even fall due to various market and economic factors not mentioned in the news. Given the positive tone of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) might experience varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the probability leans slightly towards a positive stock movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
