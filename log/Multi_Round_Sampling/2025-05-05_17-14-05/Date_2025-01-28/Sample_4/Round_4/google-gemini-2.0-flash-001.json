(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive sentiment regarding Apple Inc. due to an analyst's buy rating and raised price target, alongside expectations of revenue growth in Q4 and the implications of AI innovation. The reported increase in share price of 4% reflects optimism in the market. The potential for revenue growth in the Services segment and a robust outlook for new AI models further supports a bullish perspective. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the immediate positive impact of the analyst's report and potential growth outweighs these concerns. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Positively, Nasdaq futures are up slightly, indicating a potential rebound after the tech sell-off. However, the core driver of the sell-off is the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model that is directly impacting Apple as its app surpassed ChatGPT in downloads. The success of DeepSeek raises concerns about the potential for reduced spending on AI within the tech industry and places pressure on companies like Apple to demonstrate the value of their AI investments, specifically mentioned within the article related to earnings outlook. The article states this has been considered by U.S. President Donald Trump as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for American companies, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledging the impressiveness of the DeepSeek Model. Furthermore, Apple is reporting earnings this week, intensifying focus on its AI strategy. Though not explicitly stated, the success of the Chinese app may also reduce projected app download revenue, and also poses the prospect that Apple's products may fall behind more cheaply produced and equally capable AI software. Given the potential negative impact of DeepSeek's model alongside earnings coming this week, the probability of a price decrease or static movement is more elevated than a price rise. As such, a price decrease seems to be more likely in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) claims Apple held the top spot with a 17.4% market share in Q4, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and significant year-over-year decline in shipments.  This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a general decline in Apple's market share in China compared to the previous year.  The 4% price increase mentioned in the headline likely predates the publication of the full article, and may be attributed to other market factors unrelated to the reported data. The author also expresses skepticism regarding Apple's future performance compared to AI stocks, adding to a bearish sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the author's bearish viewpoint, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, though the conflicting data makes a definitive prediction challenging. The 4% price jump is likely a short-term blip and not solely reflective of the conflicting Chinese market data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth, with a 14% year-over-year increase, and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the stock is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. The overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling, and the iPhone's performance, a major revenue contributor, is under scrutiny due to skepticism around Apple Intelligence. Given these factors, the stock's movement post-earnings is likely to be influenced by the actual results and guidance, particularly regarding China sales and Services growth. The unchanged EPS estimates and stagnant top-line growth add to the uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Wall Street analysts believe Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is Warren Buffett's largest holding, is poised to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025. This optimistic outlook could drive the stock price up as it indicates strong confidence in the company's future performance, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the news also mentions a note of skepticism ('Here's Why I'm Not So Sure'), which might temper overly enthusiastic expectations. Overall, the positive sentiment from influential investors like Warren Buffett and supportive analyst forecasts could lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is one of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks that have shown solid gains in 2024. This suggests a positive trend for the company, which could lead to an increase in its stock price. The fact that these stocks have a disproportionate influence on the market-cap weighted Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes further supports the idea that Apple's stock price may rise due to this news. However, it's also possible that the stock price may not rise or may even fall due to various market and economic factors not mentioned in the news. Given the positive tone of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) might experience varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the probability leans slightly towards a positive stock movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting an analyst's 'Buy' rating and an increased price target, along with promising revenue growth indicators in both the upcoming earnings report and the company's Services segment. While there are concerns about regulatory risks and competitive threats posed by new AI models like DeepSeek, the immediate market reaction showed a significant 4% rise in share prices, indicating strong investor confidence. Given the context of AI innovation driving future demand and the analyst's optimism, the probabilities skew towards a stock price rise despite some bearish sentiment noted in previous predictions. Thus, I estimate a high probability of a price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Nasdaq futures are up slightly, suggesting a possible recovery, the core issue remains the emergence of DeepSeek. DeepSeek's model challenges the necessity of massive AI spending by US tech giants, including Apple. The fact that DeepSeek's app briefly surpassed ChatGPT in downloads on Apple's App Store raises direct concerns about Apple's competitive position and potential revenue reduction from its app store, as well as an overall negative impact on the adoption of Apple Intelligence. OpenAI's Sam Altman acknowledging DeepSeek's impressiveness lends validity to the threat it poses to the current AI landscape. Apple's upcoming earnings report further intensifies scrutiny. Given these factors, while some models in the previous round were more optimistic (0.6, 0.7 probability of price increases), there remains considerable uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in China.  While IDC reports Apple as the top smartphone vendor, Counterpoint places it third, highlighting a significant year-over-year decline in shipments. This discrepancy makes it difficult to assess the impact on Apple's stock price solely based on this news.  The 4% price increase mentioned in the headline likely reflects factors beyond the reported market share data. The additional commentary questioning Apple's valuation relative to AI stocks introduces further bearish sentiment.  Considering the mixed signals, the previous predictions showing a range of probabilities (from 0.3 to 0.75 for a price rise), and the inherent volatility of the market, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  A slight lean towards a price fall is justified given the negative year-over-year shipment data from Counterpoint and the general skepticism expressed in the article.  However, the inherent uncertainty prevents a strong prediction in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth (14% year-over-year), and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the stock is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. The overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling, and the iPhone's performance, a major revenue contributor, is under scrutiny due to skepticism around Apple Intelligence. The unchanged EPS estimates and stagnant top-line growth add to the uncertainty. Given these factors, the stock's movement post-earnings is likely to be influenced by the actual results and guidance, particularly regarding China sales and Services growth. The previous predictions also show a divided sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, reflecting the mixed nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is one of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks that have shown solid gains in 2024, indicating a positive trend for the company. This, combined with the fact that these stocks have a disproportionate influence on the market-cap weighted Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes, supports the idea that Apple's stock price may rise due to this news. Considering the predictions from other models, which show a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments, I've taken a balanced approach. Models like meta-llama/llama-4-scout and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct predict a higher probability of the stock price rising, while models like google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 and deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 predict a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the overall positive tone of the news and the influence of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks on the market indexes lead me to estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to an initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) might experience varied impacts. The mixed signals from different analysts and the recovering market sentiment suggest a balanced view, but leaning slightly positive.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stemming from an analyst's reiterated 'Buy' rating and raised price target. The expectations for revenue growth in the upcoming earnings report, alongside strong performance forecasts for the Services segment, contribute to a bullish sentiment. However, mixed signals regarding competition from lower-cost AI models like DeepSeek and concerns regarding market share in China introduce some bearish pressures. Considering the positive catalyst of the analyst's report and revenue growth prospects, the probabilities lean towards a stock price rise despite the caution surrounding competition and regulatory risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The slight rise in Nasdaq futures suggests a potential recovery from the tech sell-off, but the emergence of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model poses a significant challenge. DeepSeek's app surpassing ChatGPT in downloads on Apple's App Store raises concerns about Apple's competitive position. Sam Altman's acknowledgement of DeepSeek's model adds validity to the threat. Additionally, Apple's upcoming earnings report intensifies scrutiny. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, we observe a trend towards more cautious optimism compared to the first model. The emergence of the DeepSeek product is a distinct threat to the pricing structure and the overall success of Apple products. Based on this, I predict a nearly equal chance of the stock rising or falling, leaning slightly towards falling because of the DeepSeek news overshadowing minor positive elements. Sam Altman's statements also are not a net positive, they are simply acknowledging the threat. Earnings being released so close to this news will lead to selling and price depression.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance. While IDC reports Apple as the top smartphone vendor in China, Counterpoint places it third with a significant year-over-year decline in shipments. This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  The initial 4% price increase likely reflects factors beyond just the Chinese market share data.  The article expresses skepticism regarding Apple's future performance compared to AI stocks, adding to a bearish sentiment.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of probabilities for a price rise (0.35 to 0.75) and fall (0.25 to 0.65), reflecting the mixed signals. Considering the conflicting data and the overall bearish lean in the article's commentary, combined with some models predicting a higher chance of a price fall, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise.  However, the uncertainty remains significant, preventing a strong prediction in either direction. The 4% jump is likely a short-term effect and not entirely reflective of the fundamental changes in Apple's market position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include the expectation of robust growth in the Services segment (14% year-over-year) and the first positive year-over-year change in China sales in several quarters. However, the stock is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. The overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling, and the iPhone's performance, a major revenue contributor, is under scrutiny due to skepticism around Apple Intelligence. The unchanged EPS estimates and stagnant top-line growth add to the uncertainty. Previous predictions also show a divided sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given these factors, the stock's movement post-earnings is likely to be influenced by the actual results and guidance, particularly regarding China sales and Services growth. Thus, a balanced probability is estimated with a slight edge towards a fall due to the bearish sentiment and cooling growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, Apple is expected to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025 according to Wall Street analysts, and the company's Services segment is forecasted to show robust growth. Additionally, China sales are expected to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, there are concerns about competitive threats from new AI models like DeepSeek, regulatory risks, and mixed signals regarding Apple's market share in China. Considering the divided sentiment from previous predictions, which range from 0.35 to 0.75 for a price rise, and the inherent uncertainty in the market, a balanced approach seems appropriate. However, the overall positive tone of the news and the influence of bullish sentiments from analysts and investors like Warren Buffett suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is one of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks that have shown solid gains in 2024, indicating a positive trend for the company. This, combined with the fact that these stocks have a disproportionate influence on the market-cap weighted Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes, supports the idea that Apple's stock price may rise due to this news. Considering the predictions from other models, which show a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments, I've taken a balanced approach. However, the overall positive tone of the news and the influence of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks on the market indexes lead me to estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to an initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments.

While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) might experience varied impacts. Previous predictions show a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments, with probabilities ranging widely. Considering the recovering market sentiment and the long-term strength in AI investments, the probability leans slightly towards a positive stock movement.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a significant analyst 'Buy' rating and increased price target, alongside expectations for revenue growth in both the upcoming earnings report and the Services segment. However, it also highlights concerns due to competition from low-cost AI models like DeepSeek and mixed signals regarding Apple's market share in China. While the day-of-news stock price increase of 4% reflects optimism, the existence of regulatory risks and competition introduce caution. Given the tilt towards positive sentiment from key analysts and positive financial expectations, I estimate a moderate probability for the stock price to rise, while acknowledging the bearish pressures which leads to a relatively lower estimate for a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The key negative factor is the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model, which has already impacted the market and Apple's app store rankings. Sam Altman's acknowledgement of DeepSeek's capabilities lends further credibility to the threat. While Nasdaq futures show a slight rebound, the DeepSeek situation casts a shadow, raising concerns about AI spending and Apple's competitive positioning. Furthermore, the impending earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty. The trend in previous rounds indicates a move towards caution. Given the potential negative impact of DeepSeek, combined with the upcoming earnings report, the probability of a price decrease is slightly elevated. The previous rounds' models show a general mixed feeling about the stock price. Given that AI industry and Apple's related product may face great challenges, I would be more pessimistic compared to others.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the initial 4% price increase suggests positive market sentiment (possibly driven by factors beyond the reported news), conflicting reports on Apple's Chinese market share create uncertainty.  IDC reports Apple as the top vendor, while Counterpoint places it third, with significant year-over-year declines.  This discrepancy makes it difficult to assess the news's direct impact.  Furthermore, concerns about the rise of cheaper AI alternatives like DeepSeek introduce a significant bearish factor, raising questions about Apple's future competitiveness and potential revenue pressures.  The overall tone of the article and the comments from analysts lean towards skepticism. While the 'Magnificent Seven' status provides some support, the conflicting information and the general bearish outlook outweigh this positive factor. Considering the previous predictions, which show a convergence toward a roughly even chance of rise or fall, I arrive at a probability that skews slightly towards a price fall, reflecting the prevailing uncertainties and competitive concerns. The upcoming earnings report adds further uncertainty as it could trigger either positive or negative responses depending on the actual results.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
