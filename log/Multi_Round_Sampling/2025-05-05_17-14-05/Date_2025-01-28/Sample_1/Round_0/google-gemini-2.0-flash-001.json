(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

However, this is based on the opinion of one portfolio manager and comes with caveats. The article mentions prior expectations of deceleration in growth, uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact, and concerns about valuation erosion. While historically new product demand has created benefits, the article focuses on big tech companies broadly, making the singular impact on Apple Inc. more uncertain. The mention of PE erosion and capex issues could raise investor concern, slightly diminishing the probable effect of the positive projection mentioned in the headline. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term projection offset by near-term uncertainty and pre-existing concerns\u2014I'll assign a slightly more positive than neutral probability to a stock price increase but not overwhelmingly so.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
