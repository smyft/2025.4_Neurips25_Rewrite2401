(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a stabilization in tech stocks after a prior sell-off, suggesting that investor sentiment may be improving. While there are concerns about AI spending and potential overconcentration in the sector, the medium-term outlook remains optimistic, particularly for companies involved in AI infrastructure. Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector but not directly referenced in the context of AI spending as much as Nvidia, its stock movement may be influenced by the overall recovery sentiment in tech rather than direct impact from AI trends. The mixed signals regarding AI spending may keep investors cautious, leading to a slight tilt toward a price decline, but the positive shift in tech sentiment supports a rise as well. Hence, probabilities reflect a balanced yet cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, suggesting a potential 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025. However, this is based on the opinion of one portfolio manager and comes with caveats. The article mentions prior expectations of deceleration in growth, uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact, and concerns about valuation erosion. While historically new product demand has created benefits, the article focuses on big tech companies broadly, making the singular impact on Apple Inc. more uncertain. The mention of PE erosion and capex issues could raise investor concern, slightly diminishing the probable effect of the positive projection mentioned in the headline. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term projection offset by near-term uncertainty and pre-existing concerns\u2014I'll assign a slightly more positive than neutral probability to a stock price increase but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) claims Apple held the top spot with a 17.4% market share in Q4, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and significant year-over-year decline in shipments.  This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a year-on-year decline in market share, and Dan Niles' comment that the stock is 'pretty expensive' adds to the bearish sentiment. While the initial 4% rise mentioned is likely due to the IDC report, the conflicting data and negative long-term trend suggest a higher probability of a price correction or stagnation rather than continued substantial growth. The overall picture is mixed, with short-term positive sentiment potentially being overshadowed by longer-term concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator for the stock. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an 'above-average valuation,' which could imply that the stock is overpriced relative to its peers or historical averages. This mixed signal makes the short-term price movement uncertain. The positive aspect of strong revenue generation may attract investors, but the high valuation could deter some, leading to a balanced probability of price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and its partnership with the US government, as well as the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the AI industry, has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the increased focus on AI and its applications could potentially benefit Apple, given its significant investments in AI research and development. On the other hand, the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business or announce any specific developments that would directly impact the company's financials or product lineup. However, considering that Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) gained ground during the sell-off caused by DeepSeek's breakout, it suggests that investors might view Apple as a company that could benefit from the heightened competition and innovation in the AI space, potentially leading to increased spending and advancements in AI technologies that Apple could leverage.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model. The analysts at Baird argue that Apple's exposure to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model is limited, and the company can benefit from generative AI without spending heavily on large language models or infrastructure. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's competitive impact from DeepSeek is limited, and the company's iPhone business could see a better cycle of product upgrades due to expanding generative AI capabilities. Overall, the news suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its AI initiatives. Additionally, Apple's performance in key markets like China is being questioned, which adds further uncertainty.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a stabilization in tech stocks following a significant sell-off, which is a positive sign for investor sentiment. Despite some concerns regarding AI spending and the broader implications of DeepSeek's success, the medium-term outlook remains positive according to some analysts. The potential for increased compute needs tied to AI advancements may position Apple favorably in the long run. However, mixed signals about AI spending and potential overconcentration in the tech sector suggest that while there is a cautious optimism, immediate concerns remain. Therefore, a slightly positive probability of an increase in stock price is suggested amidst the uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on a portfolio manager's optimistic outlook for the tech sector in 2025, projecting a 20% earnings growth. This positive forecast could drive investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple. However, the article also acknowledges concerns about slowing growth, negative capex impacts, and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's impact, suggesting some potential headwinds. Taking into account the previous predictions which varied widely and displayed some volatility associated with different predictions, it is more reasonable to suggest a balanced impact of either upward or downward trend. Given the balanced view, with previous predictions already factoring the positive news, I would put a small negative bias in the prediction. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting signals regarding Apple's performance.  While the initial 4% jump is attributed to a report showing Apple as the top smartphone seller in China in Q4, this is countered by another report placing Apple in third place with declining shipments.  The discrepancy in these reports introduces significant uncertainty. Furthermore, the year-over-year decline in market share and Dan Niles' comment about the stock being 'pretty expensive' contribute to bearish sentiment.  The short-term positive reaction might be fleeting, given the longer-term concerns about market share erosion.  Previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting this uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for a short-term positive reaction to be followed by a correction, I assign a higher probability to a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging the possibility of continued short-term gains based on the initial positive market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive signal for investors. However, it also notes that the stock trades at an 'above-average valuation,' which could deter some investors due to perceived overvaluation. The previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models leaning slightly bullish (0.55-0.7 probability of rise) and others more bearish (0.3-0.6 probability of fall). The consensus seems to be a balanced view with a slight tilt towards a rise, considering Apple's strong revenue generation and market position, but tempered by valuation concerns. Given the mixed signals and the overall sentiment from previous predictions, I assign a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, acknowledging the potential for short-term volatility due to valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, with limited exposure to the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model. Analysts at Baird argue that Apple can benefit from generative AI without heavy spending on large language models or infrastructure, and the company's iPhone business could see a better cycle of product upgrades due to expanding generative AI capabilities. Considering the positive outlook from Baird and the limited competitive impact from DeepSeek, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the emergence of new AI technologies and the potential for increased competition in the tech sector introduce some uncertainty, preventing a very high probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs.

This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its AI initiatives. Additionally, Apple's performance in key markets like China is being questioned, which adds further uncertainty. The overall message suggests a cautious outlook, with negative sentiments about consumer AI trends potentially outweighing positive signals in the enterprise segment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
