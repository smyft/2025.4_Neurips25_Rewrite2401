      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: OpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov as industry reels from DeepSeek's breakout\nNews Content: OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe move further cements OpenAI's partnership with the US government, positioning its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership.\n\nLast week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office. Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a stabilization in tech stocks after a prior sell-off, suggesting that investor sentiment may be improving. While there are concerns about AI spending and potential overconcentration in the sector, the medium-term outlook remains optimistic, particularly for companies involved in AI infrastructure. Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector but not directly referenced in the context of AI spending as much as Nvidia, its stock movement may be influenced by the overall recovery sentiment in tech rather than direct impact from AI trends. The mixed signals regarding AI spending may keep investors cautious, leading to a slight tilt toward a price decline, but the positive shift in tech sentiment supports a rise as well. Hence, probabilities reflect a balanced yet cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, suggesting a potential 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025. However, this is based on the opinion of one portfolio manager and comes with caveats. The article mentions prior expectations of deceleration in growth, uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact, and concerns about valuation erosion. While historically new product demand has created benefits, the article focuses on big tech companies broadly, making the singular impact on Apple Inc. more uncertain. The mention of PE erosion and capex issues could raise investor concern, slightly diminishing the probable effect of the positive projection mentioned in the headline. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term projection offset by near-term uncertainty and pre-existing concerns\u2014I'll assign a slightly more positive than neutral probability to a stock price increase but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) claims Apple held the top spot with a 17.4% market share in Q4, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and significant year-over-year decline in shipments.  This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a year-on-year decline in market share, and Dan Niles' comment that the stock is 'pretty expensive' adds to the bearish sentiment. While the initial 4% rise mentioned is likely due to the IDC report, the conflicting data and negative long-term trend suggest a higher probability of a price correction or stagnation rather than continued substantial growth. The overall picture is mixed, with short-term positive sentiment potentially being overshadowed by longer-term concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator for the stock. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an 'above-average valuation,' which could imply that the stock is overpriced relative to its peers or historical averages. This mixed signal makes the short-term price movement uncertain. The positive aspect of strong revenue generation may attract investors, but the high valuation could deter some, leading to a balanced probability of price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and its partnership with the US government, as well as the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the AI industry, has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the increased focus on AI and its applications could potentially benefit Apple, given its significant investments in AI research and development. On the other hand, the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business or announce any specific developments that would directly impact the company's financials or product lineup. However, considering that Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) gained ground during the sell-off caused by DeepSeek's breakout, it suggests that investors might view Apple as a company that could benefit from the heightened competition and innovation in the AI space, potentially leading to increased spending and advancements in AI technologies that Apple could leverage.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model. The analysts at Baird argue that Apple's exposure to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model is limited, and the company can benefit from generative AI without spending heavily on large language models or infrastructure. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's competitive impact from DeepSeek is limited, and the company's iPhone business could see a better cycle of product upgrades due to expanding generative AI capabilities. Overall, the news suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its AI initiatives. Additionally, Apple's performance in key markets like China is being questioned, which adds further uncertainty.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a stabilization in tech stocks following a significant sell-off, which is a positive sign for investor sentiment. Despite some concerns regarding AI spending and the broader implications of DeepSeek's success, the medium-term outlook remains positive according to some analysts. The potential for increased compute needs tied to AI advancements may position Apple favorably in the long run. However, mixed signals about AI spending and potential overconcentration in the tech sector suggest that while there is a cautious optimism, immediate concerns remain. Therefore, a slightly positive probability of an increase in stock price is suggested amidst the uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on a portfolio manager's optimistic outlook for the tech sector in 2025, projecting a 20% earnings growth. This positive forecast could drive investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple. However, the article also acknowledges concerns about slowing growth, negative capex impacts, and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's impact, suggesting some potential headwinds. Taking into account the previous predictions which varied widely and displayed some volatility associated with different predictions, it is more reasonable to suggest a balanced impact of either upward or downward trend. Given the balanced view, with previous predictions already factoring the positive news, I would put a small negative bias in the prediction. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting signals regarding Apple's performance.  While the initial 4% jump is attributed to a report showing Apple as the top smartphone seller in China in Q4, this is countered by another report placing Apple in third place with declining shipments.  The discrepancy in these reports introduces significant uncertainty. Furthermore, the year-over-year decline in market share and Dan Niles' comment about the stock being 'pretty expensive' contribute to bearish sentiment.  The short-term positive reaction might be fleeting, given the longer-term concerns about market share erosion.  Previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting this uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for a short-term positive reaction to be followed by a correction, I assign a higher probability to a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging the possibility of continued short-term gains based on the initial positive market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive signal for investors. However, it also notes that the stock trades at an 'above-average valuation,' which could deter some investors due to perceived overvaluation. The previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models leaning slightly bullish (0.55-0.7 probability of rise) and others more bearish (0.3-0.6 probability of fall). The consensus seems to be a balanced view with a slight tilt towards a rise, considering Apple's strong revenue generation and market position, but tempered by valuation concerns. Given the mixed signals and the overall sentiment from previous predictions, I assign a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, acknowledging the potential for short-term volatility due to valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, with limited exposure to the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model. Analysts at Baird argue that Apple can benefit from generative AI without heavy spending on large language models or infrastructure, and the company's iPhone business could see a better cycle of product upgrades due to expanding generative AI capabilities. Considering the positive outlook from Baird and the limited competitive impact from DeepSeek, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the emergence of new AI technologies and the potential for increased competition in the tech sector introduce some uncertainty, preventing a very high probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its AI initiatives. Additionally, Apple's performance in key markets like China is being questioned, which adds further uncertainty. The overall message suggests a cautious outlook, with negative sentiments about consumer AI trends potentially outweighing positive signals in the enterprise segment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a stabilization in tech stocks post-sell-off, and indications of potential growth in AI-related capabilities, there are also concerns surrounding AI spending and competitive pressures from emerging technologies like DeepSeek. Analysts show varied opinions, with some projecting positive medium-term insights for the tech sector but also raising caution about valuation and market share discrepancies. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a slightly positive probability of the stock price rising, leaning towards 0.55 since investor sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic but tempered by ongoing uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a positive outlook for the tech sector in 2025, with projected earnings growth of 20%. This optimism could boost investor confidence in Apple. However, the news also acknowledges uncertainties like the impact of DeepSeek, prior expectations of decelerated growth, and potential erosion in PE ratios due to concerns about slowing expansion and capital expenditure impacts. Considering these mixed signals and the previous round of predictions being relatively evenly distributed between positive and negative movement, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising. The positive outlook for the tech sector's earnings growth is the primary driver for this, but the associated risks cannot be neglected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in China. While one report shows Apple as the top smartphone seller, another indicates a decline in market share and shipments. This discrepancy introduces significant uncertainty.  Dan Niles' comment about the stock being 'expensive' adds to the bearish sentiment.  The initial 4% rise is likely a short-term reaction to the positive report, but the longer-term concerns suggest a potential correction or stagnation.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering the conflicting data, negative long-term trends, and the possibility of a short-term positive reaction being followed by a correction, I assign a slightly higher probability to a fall, acknowledging the possibility of continued short-term gains based on the initial market reaction. The overall sentiment from previous rounds leans slightly towards a rise.  However, given the conflicting information and the analyst's negative assessment of valuation, my prediction reflects a more cautious approach than a purely bullish view. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company is described as 'still printing money,' indicating strong revenue generation, which could attract investors. However, the mention of an 'above-average valuation' suggests potential overvaluation, which might deter some investors. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning slightly bullish (0.55-0.7 probability of rise) and others more bearish (0.3-0.6 probability of fall). The consensus appears to be a balanced view with a slight tilt towards a rise, considering Apple's strong market position and revenue, but tempered by valuation concerns.

On the other hand, the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business or announce any specific developments that would directly impact the company's financials or product lineup. However, considering that Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) gained ground during the sell-off caused by DeepSeek's breakout, it suggests that investors might view Apple as a company that could benefit from the heightened competition and innovation in the AI space, potentially leading to increased spending and advancements in AI technologies that Apple could leverage. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning slightly bullish and others more bearish. Given the mixed signals and the overall sentiment from previous predictions, I assign a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, acknowledging the potential for short-term volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, with limited exposure to the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model. Analysts at Baird argue that Apple can benefit from generative AI without heavy spending on large language models or infrastructure, and the company's iPhone business could see a better cycle of product upgrades due to expanding generative AI capabilities. Considering the positive outlook from Baird and the limited competitive impact from DeepSeek, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the emergence of new AI technologies and the potential for increased competition in the tech sector introduce some uncertainty, preventing a very high probability of a stock price rise. The previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models leaning slightly bullish and others more bearish.

The overall message suggests a cautious outlook, with negative sentiments about consumer AI trends potentially outweighing positive signals in the enterprise segment. The previous predictions also show a range of sentiments, from bearish to somewhat bullish.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news reflects a mixed sentiment for Apple Inc. regarding its stock price movement. While there are indications of recovery in tech stocks following a sell-off and positive medium-term projections for AI capabilities, there are also concerns about competitive pressures, particularly related to the new DeepSeek AI model. Various analysts and models have presented differing probabilities, suggesting a cautious yet optimistic outlook. Overall, Apple's strong revenue generation is a positive factor, but the 'above-average valuation' raises concerns. This duality led me to assign a slight edge towards the stock price rising, though with a significant probability assigned to falling as well due to the uncertainties expressed in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news focuses on a portfolio manager's optimistic outlook for the tech sector in 2025, with a projected 20% earnings growth potentially benefiting Apple. However, this is countered by uncertainties regarding DeepSeek's impact, previous expectations of decelerating growth, and valuation erosion concerns. The previous rounds of predictions show mixed sentiments, with a slight tendency towards a rise, but with significant variability indicating high uncertainty. Given this and the conflicting information, I am assigning a near-equal probability of rise and fall, with a very slight preference for a rise due to the positive earnings projection, though tempered by associated risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's market share in China. While one report shows Apple as the top smartphone seller, another shows a decline in market share and shipments, creating considerable uncertainty.  This discrepancy, coupled with Dan Niles' negative comment about Apple's valuation, introduces a significant bearish element.  The initial 4% price increase is likely a short-term reaction to the positive report, but the longer-term negative trends and valuation concerns suggest a higher probability of a correction or stagnation.  Analysis of previous predictions reveals a range of opinions, with no clear consensus.  However, the weight of evidence, including the conflicting reports, the negative analyst comment, and the year-over-year decline in market share, points towards a higher chance of a price fall in the medium-term.  The short-term effects of the positive report may still be in play, leading to some probability of a price rise, but this is likely temporary.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
