(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\nNews Content: Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model than its other Big Tech rivals who have invested heavily in building out their AI capabilities, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts argued that the iPhone maker, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on [large language models] or infrastructure\".\n\nAlthough the company is continuing to roll out its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service in its latest iPhone offerings, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is \"limited\", the analysts said. Indeed, longer term, expanding generative AI capabilities could catalyze a \"better cycle\" of product upgrades, they noted.\n\nDeepSeek, a small Chinese start-up, roiled global stock markets on Monday after it introduced a free chatbot it says can compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant, which is run on the model, became the top-rated app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said the company represented a \"wake-up call\" for America's tech giants.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\nApple is due to report its December quarter results after the closing bell on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\n\nNextEra Energy's XPLR Infrastructure shares tank on dividend suspension\n\nS&P, Nasdaq eye higher open as AI stocks recover, earnings roll in\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a stabilization in tech stocks after a prior sell-off, suggesting that investor sentiment may be improving. While there are concerns about AI spending and potential overconcentration in the sector, the medium-term outlook remains optimistic, particularly for companies involved in AI infrastructure. Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector but not directly referenced in the context of AI spending as much as Nvidia, its stock movement may be influenced by the overall recovery sentiment in tech rather than direct impact from AI trends. The mixed signals regarding AI spending may keep investors cautious, leading to a slight tilt toward a price decline, but the positive shift in tech sentiment supports a rise as well. Hence, probabilities reflect a balanced yet cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, suggesting a potential 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025. However, this is based on the opinion of one portfolio manager and comes with caveats. The article mentions prior expectations of deceleration in growth, uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact, and concerns about valuation erosion. While historically new product demand has created benefits, the article focuses on big tech companies broadly, making the singular impact on Apple Inc. more uncertain. The mention of PE erosion and capex issues could raise investor concern, slightly diminishing the probable effect of the positive projection mentioned in the headline. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term projection offset by near-term uncertainty and pre-existing concerns\u2014I'll assign a slightly more positive than neutral probability to a stock price increase but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) claims Apple held the top spot with a 17.4% market share in Q4, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and significant year-over-year decline in shipments.  This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a year-on-year decline in market share, and Dan Niles' comment that the stock is 'pretty expensive' adds to the bearish sentiment. While the initial 4% rise mentioned is likely due to the IDC report, the conflicting data and negative long-term trend suggest a higher probability of a price correction or stagnation rather than continued substantial growth. The overall picture is mixed, with short-term positive sentiment potentially being overshadowed by longer-term concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator for the stock. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an 'above-average valuation,' which could imply that the stock is overpriced relative to its peers or historical averages. This mixed signal makes the short-term price movement uncertain. The positive aspect of strong revenue generation may attract investors, but the high valuation could deter some, leading to a balanced probability of price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and its partnership with the US government, as well as the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the AI industry, has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the increased focus on AI and its applications could potentially benefit Apple, given its significant investments in AI research and development. On the other hand, the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business or announce any specific developments that would directly impact the company's financials or product lineup. However, considering that Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) gained ground during the sell-off caused by DeepSeek's breakout, it suggests that investors might view Apple as a company that could benefit from the heightened competition and innovation in the AI space, potentially leading to increased spending and advancements in AI technologies that Apple could leverage.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model. The analysts at Baird argue that Apple's exposure to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model is limited, and the company can benefit from generative AI without spending heavily on large language models or infrastructure. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's competitive impact from DeepSeek is limited, and the company's iPhone business could see a better cycle of product upgrades due to expanding generative AI capabilities. Overall, the news suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its AI initiatives. Additionally, Apple's performance in key markets like China is being questioned, which adds further uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
