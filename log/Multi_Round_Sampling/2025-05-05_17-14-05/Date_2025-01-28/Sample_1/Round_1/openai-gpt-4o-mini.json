(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a stabilization in tech stocks after a prior sell-off, suggesting that investor sentiment may be improving. While there are concerns about AI spending and potential overconcentration in the sector, the medium-term outlook remains optimistic, particularly for companies involved in AI infrastructure. Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector but not directly referenced in the context of AI spending as much as Nvidia, its stock movement may be influenced by the overall recovery sentiment in tech rather than direct impact from AI trends. The mixed signals regarding AI spending may keep investors cautious, leading to a slight tilt toward a price decline, but the positive shift in tech sentiment supports a rise as well. Hence, probabilities reflect a balanced yet cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, suggesting a potential 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025. However, this is based on the opinion of one portfolio manager and comes with caveats. The article mentions prior expectations of deceleration in growth, uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact, and concerns about valuation erosion. While historically new product demand has created benefits, the article focuses on big tech companies broadly, making the singular impact on Apple Inc. more uncertain. The mention of PE erosion and capex issues could raise investor concern, slightly diminishing the probable effect of the positive projection mentioned in the headline. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term projection offset by near-term uncertainty and pre-existing concerns\u2014I'll assign a slightly more positive than neutral probability to a stock price increase but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) claims Apple held the top spot with a 17.4% market share in Q4, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and significant year-over-year decline in shipments.  This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a year-on-year decline in market share, and Dan Niles' comment that the stock is 'pretty expensive' adds to the bearish sentiment. While the initial 4% rise mentioned is likely due to the IDC report, the conflicting data and negative long-term trend suggest a higher probability of a price correction or stagnation rather than continued substantial growth. The overall picture is mixed, with short-term positive sentiment potentially being overshadowed by longer-term concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator for the stock. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an 'above-average valuation,' which could imply that the stock is overpriced relative to its peers or historical averages. This mixed signal makes the short-term price movement uncertain. The positive aspect of strong revenue generation may attract investors, but the high valuation could deter some, leading to a balanced probability of price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and its partnership with the US government, as well as the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the AI industry, has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the increased focus on AI and its applications could potentially benefit Apple, given its significant investments in AI research and development. On the other hand, the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business or announce any specific developments that would directly impact the company's financials or product lineup. However, considering that Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) gained ground during the sell-off caused by DeepSeek's breakout, it suggests that investors might view Apple as a company that could benefit from the heightened competition and innovation in the AI space, potentially leading to increased spending and advancements in AI technologies that Apple could leverage.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model. The analysts at Baird argue that Apple's exposure to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model is limited, and the company can benefit from generative AI without spending heavily on large language models or infrastructure. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's competitive impact from DeepSeek is limited, and the company's iPhone business could see a better cycle of product upgrades due to expanding generative AI capabilities. Overall, the news suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its AI initiatives. Additionally, Apple's performance in key markets like China is being questioned, which adds further uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
