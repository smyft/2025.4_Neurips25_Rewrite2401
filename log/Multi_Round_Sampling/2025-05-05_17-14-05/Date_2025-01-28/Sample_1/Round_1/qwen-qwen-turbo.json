(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a stabilization in tech stocks after a prior sell-off, suggesting that investor sentiment may be improving. While there are concerns about AI spending and potential overconcentration in the sector, the medium-term outlook remains optimistic, particularly for companies involved in AI infrastructure. Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector but not directly referenced in the context of AI spending as much as Nvidia, its stock movement may be influenced by the overall recovery sentiment in tech rather than direct impact from AI trends. The mixed signals regarding AI spending may keep investors cautious, leading to a slight tilt toward a price decline, but the positive shift in tech sentiment supports a rise as well. Hence, probabilities reflect a balanced yet cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, suggesting a potential 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025. However, this is based on the opinion of one portfolio manager and comes with caveats. The article mentions prior expectations of deceleration in growth, uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact, and concerns about valuation erosion. While historically new product demand has created benefits, the article focuses on big tech companies broadly, making the singular impact on Apple Inc. more uncertain. The mention of PE erosion and capex issues could raise investor concern, slightly diminishing the probable effect of the positive projection mentioned in the headline. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term projection offset by near-term uncertainty and pre-existing concerns\u2014I'll assign a slightly more positive than neutral probability to a stock price increase but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) claims Apple held the top spot with a 17.4% market share in Q4, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and significant year-over-year decline in shipments.  This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a year-on-year decline in market share, and Dan Niles' comment that the stock is 'pretty expensive' adds to the bearish sentiment. While the initial 4% rise mentioned is likely due to the IDC report, the conflicting data and negative long-term trend suggest a higher probability of a price correction or stagnation rather than continued substantial growth. The overall picture is mixed, with short-term positive sentiment potentially being overshadowed by longer-term concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator for the stock. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an 'above-average valuation,' which could imply that the stock is overpriced relative to its peers or historical averages. This mixed signal makes the short-term price movement uncertain. The positive aspect of strong revenue generation may attract investors, but the high valuation could deter some, leading to a balanced probability of price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and its partnership with the US government, as well as the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the AI industry, has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the increased focus on AI and its applications could potentially benefit Apple, given its significant investments in AI research and development. On the other hand, the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business or announce any specific developments that would directly impact the company's financials or product lineup. However, considering that Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) gained ground during the sell-off caused by DeepSeek's breakout, it suggests that investors might view Apple as a company that could benefit from the heightened competition and innovation in the AI space, potentially leading to increased spending and advancements in AI technologies that Apple could leverage.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model. The analysts at Baird argue that Apple's exposure to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model is limited, and the company can benefit from generative AI without spending heavily on large language models or infrastructure. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's competitive impact from DeepSeek is limited, and the company's iPhone business could see a better cycle of product upgrades due to expanding generative AI capabilities. Overall, the news suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its AI initiatives. Additionally, Apple's performance in key markets like China is being questioned, which adds further uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
