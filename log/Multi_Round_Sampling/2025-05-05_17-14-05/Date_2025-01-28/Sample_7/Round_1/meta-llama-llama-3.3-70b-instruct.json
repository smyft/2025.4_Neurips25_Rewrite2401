      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news does not directly comment on Apple Inc. but focuses on ISA millionaires investing in various stocks and funds. The prominence of technology stocks, including Apple, in the investment strategies of these wealthier investors suggests potential continued interest and capital inflow towards technology, which could support Apple's stock price. However, general market fluctuations and sector weaknesses may still pose risks. Given the context, there's a moderate probability of a price rise due to sustained investment interest among affluent investors, coupled with a lower probability of a significant decline due to external pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) from Bank of America. Despite a broader market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's AI breakthrough, Apple's stock *rose* 3%, suggesting investor confidence in its resilience and potential in edge AI. BofA analysts cite several upcoming catalysts for Apple, including the potential launch of iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, WWDC with focus on AI applications and even the future iPhone 17 release. The defensive nature of the stock and investors moving toward stocks with resilient earning makes BofA think a buying opportunity has presented itself for Apple. Moreover, the belief that Apple could benefit from the Deepseek AI advancement, especially the implication that AI inferencing cost could drop and new development will be accelerated, is another factor that might further boost Apple's stock prices as an LLM device leader. The news is very bullish for AAPL given the specific rationale and potential catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a prediction of Apple reaching a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, a significant increase from its current market cap.  However, this is presented as an opinion piece, with the author expressing skepticism.  The article doesn't provide concrete new information about Apple's fundamentals or performance that would definitively drive the stock price up or down. The mention of Warren Buffett's holdings is relevant but not directly indicative of future price movements; his continued investment reflects long-term confidence but doesn't predict short-term volatility. Therefore, the news itself has limited impact on predicting immediate stock price movement. The probability of a price increase or decrease is mostly driven by existing market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the provided news.  I'm assuming a neutral baseline probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc., including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase, expected revenue growth, and advancements in AI technology that could drive future demand. The Services segment's robust growth also indicates revenue diversification. While there are mentions of regulatory risks, the overall sentiment is positive, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports mixed signals about Apple's (AAPL) performance in China. On one hand, a research firm, IDC, reported that iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter with a 17.4% market share, slightly above Huawei's 17.2%. This information could potentially boost investor confidence and contribute to a rise in stock price. On the other hand, another research firm, Counterpoint, stated that iPhone's market share was 17.1% in China, placing it in third place, and noted an 18.2% decline in devices handed over by Apple in China compared to the same period a year earlier. Additionally, analyst Dan Niles described the data as 'somewhat disappointing' and characterized the stock as 'pretty expensive'. Given these mixed signals, the stock is currently up 4%, indicating a positive short-term reaction to the IDC report. However, considering the overall performance and analyst comments, there is a cautious outlook which might limit further gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article mentions that the technology sector, including Big Tech companies like Apple, is expected to experience 20% earnings growth in 2025 according to a portfolio manager. This projection is despite initial concerns about the impact of new AI models on the sector. Historically, new product entries have created increased demand, benefiting the entire tech market. Additionally, the portfolio manager notes that the current valuations can be justified with the projected earnings growth. However, there are also mentions of uncertainties and erosion of price-earnings ratios due to slowing growth concerns. Considering these points, the overall sentiment seems positive, indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
