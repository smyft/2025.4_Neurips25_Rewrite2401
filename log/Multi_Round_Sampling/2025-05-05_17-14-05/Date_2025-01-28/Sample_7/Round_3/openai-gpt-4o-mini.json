      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Where the UK\u2019s ISA millionaires are investing\nNews Content: The number of investors with \u00a31 million or more in their stocks and shares individual savings account (ISA) is on the rise, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's (HL.L) platform data, which revealed where they are putting their money.\n\nThe UK's biggest investment platform said there were 1,322 \"ISA millionaires\" on its platform as of the end of December.\n\nThe figure was up 14% over the previous six months alone and was much higher when compared to the 168 ISA millionaires on the platform seven years ago, with just three recorded in 2012.\n\nHL found that the average age of an ISA millionaire on its platform was now 72 years old, down from 74 six months ago. However, the gender split of ISA millionaires had not changed from two years ago, with just over two-thirds found to be men.\n\n\"Some people get into investment in the hope of getting rich quick, but the vast majority of ISA millionaires have built a fortune through the far more reliable approach of getting rich slow,\" said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at HL.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\n\"They don\u2019t necessarily take enormous risks: many consistently invest as much as possible of their annual allowance, in a diverse and balanced portfolio, every year, for decades.\"\n\nMarshall pointed out that the top 10 stocks bought by this group were dominated by UK-listed blue-chip companies, including those that have traditionally paid strong dividends.\n\n\"It means most of them aren\u2019t speculating,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not in a hurry to trade them regularly either as, while most ISA millionaires traded in 2024, this has tended to be infrequent.\"\n\nAs for the most bought funds, Marshall said ISA millionaires were investing in a broad international mix of popular funds. Half of these funds were focused on a diversified mix of global companies, though there were also a couple of UK funds on the list, including an income fund.\n\n\"This reflects that as investors get older, some of the portfolio may have been reconfigured for income,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a larger portfolio, you have more scope to add specialist funds into the mix, which is why we see a technology and India fund in the list of popular investments. Investors with a larger portfolio may be willing to take more risks, partly as they may have more scope for loss, or have sufficient stores of value elsewhere, such as cash ISAs, savings accounts, or annuities.\"\n\nHere's more detail on which were the most popular stocks and funds with HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLegal & General Group (LGEN.L)\n\nFinancial services company Legal & General Group was one name on the list, despite its shares trading nearly 8% in the red on a one-year basis.\n\nIn December, the firm said it was planning to return capital to investors and was on track to meet financial targets. L&G said it was on track to deliver mid-single digital growth in operating profit for the 2024 fiscal year, in line with guidance\n\nOperating profit in its half-year results came in at \u00a3920m ($1.14bn), slightly below the \u00a3924m it delivered in the first half of 2023. Profit after tax attributable to shareholders was down 41% to \u00a3223m.\n\nHowever, L&G raised its half-year dividend by 5% to 6p per share. The company's full-year results are due out on 12 March.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(LGEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nAnother big name on the list was BP, though shares in the oil major are down nearly 10% on a one-year basis.\n\nIn October, BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The oil major reported a nearly 30% slump in underlying replacement cost profit to $2.3bn (\u00a31.85bn) in the third quarter. Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric BP uses as its version of net income.\n\nBP attributed the fall in net income in the third quarter to factors such as weaker realised refining margins and a poor oil trading result.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite worse quarterly results, BP announced a share buyback of $1.75bn as part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that is still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\n\nOil prices have been under pressure over concerns about weaker demand and geopolitical tensions, which has pushed brent crude (BZ=F) back below $78 per barrel.\n\nBP's fourth quarter results and its latest dividend announcement are due out on 11 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(BP.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMiner Rio Tinto also made HL's list of the most-bought stocks by ISA millionaires. While the stock is down nearly 12% over the past year, it recently ticked up slightly on reports that it had been in talks with Glencore (GLEN.L) about a potential merger, though discussions were said to no longer be active.\n\nIn its recently released fourth quarter production results, Rio Tinto said its mined copper production was up 13% in 2024 on the previous year.\n\nCEO Jakob Stausholm said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that US president Donald Trump will give the green light to the company's copper mine in Arizona.\n\n\"I do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he said. It comes after a long battle over permits for the mine.\n\nThe Resolution mine would be the biggest copper mine in North America once completed, capable of producing as much as 25% of US copper demand each year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(RIO.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nISA millionaire top funds\n\nFive Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) index funds were among those most bought by HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nThis included the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P000023MW.L), which tracks the performance of the FTSE World \u2013 Technology index.\n\nThe \u00a33.8bn fund is up nearly 38% over the past year, with its top holdings including iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAnother popular fund with ISA millionaires was Jupiter India (0P0000U20R.L), which has delivered a return of 24% over one year. This return was ahead of its target benchmark of the 13% return from the MSCI India index with net dividends re-invested.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nThe biggest sectors the fund is allocated to are financials and healthcare. Its biggest holdings include tobacco manufacturer Godfrey Phillips India (GODFRYPHLP.NS) and private hospital network Fortis Healthcare (FORTIS.NS).\n\nArtemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L), which invests in UK companies, was also named on HL's list. The fund has produced a return of 15% over one year, beating the FTSE All-Share's (0P00000CNT.L) 9.5%.\n\nFinancials also make up the biggest share of sector exposure in this fund, followed by consumer discretionary and staples firms.\n\nTop holdings include Pearson (PSON.L), which provides educational materials and technology, along with private equity investment trust 3i Group (III.L).\n\nRead more:\n\n6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency Five ways to save on the cost of having children\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news does not directly comment on Apple Inc. but focuses on ISA millionaires investing in various stocks and funds. The prominence of technology stocks, including Apple, in the investment strategies of these wealthier investors suggests potential continued interest and capital inflow towards technology, which could support Apple's stock price. However, general market fluctuations and sector weaknesses may still pose risks. Given the context, there's a moderate probability of a price rise due to sustained investment interest among affluent investors, coupled with a lower probability of a significant decline due to external pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) from Bank of America. Despite a broader market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's AI breakthrough, Apple's stock *rose* 3%, suggesting investor confidence in its resilience and potential in edge AI. BofA analysts cite several upcoming catalysts for Apple, including the potential launch of iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, WWDC with focus on AI applications and even the future iPhone 17 release. The defensive nature of the stock and investors moving toward stocks with resilient earning makes BofA think a buying opportunity has presented itself for Apple. Moreover, the belief that Apple could benefit from the Deepseek AI advancement, especially the implication that AI inferencing cost could drop and new development will be accelerated, is another factor that might further boost Apple's stock prices as an LLM device leader. The news is very bullish for AAPL given the specific rationale and potential catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a prediction of Apple reaching a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, a significant increase from its current market cap.  However, this is presented as an opinion piece, with the author expressing skepticism.  The article doesn't provide concrete new information about Apple's fundamentals or performance that would definitively drive the stock price up or down. The mention of Warren Buffett's holdings is relevant but not directly indicative of future price movements; his continued investment reflects long-term confidence but doesn't predict short-term volatility. Therefore, the news itself has limited impact on predicting immediate stock price movement. The probability of a price increase or decrease is mostly driven by existing market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the provided news.  I'm assuming a neutral baseline probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc., including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase, expected revenue growth, and advancements in AI technology that could drive future demand. The Services segment's robust growth also indicates revenue diversification. While there are mentions of regulatory risks, the overall sentiment is positive, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports mixed signals about Apple's (AAPL) performance in China. On one hand, a research firm, IDC, reported that iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter with a 17.4% market share, slightly above Huawei's 17.2%. This information could potentially boost investor confidence and contribute to a rise in stock price. On the other hand, another research firm, Counterpoint, stated that iPhone's market share was 17.1% in China, placing it in third place, and noted an 18.2% decline in devices handed over by Apple in China compared to the same period a year earlier. Additionally, analyst Dan Niles described the data as 'somewhat disappointing' and characterized the stock as 'pretty expensive'. Given these mixed signals, the stock is currently up 4%, indicating a positive short-term reaction to the IDC report. However, considering the overall performance and analyst comments, there is a cautious outlook which might limit further gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article mentions that the technology sector, including Big Tech companies like Apple, is expected to experience 20% earnings growth in 2025 according to a portfolio manager. This projection is despite initial concerns about the impact of new AI models on the sector. Historically, new product entries have created increased demand, benefiting the entire tech market. Additionally, the portfolio manager notes that the current valuations can be justified with the projected earnings growth. However, there are also mentions of uncertainties and erosion of price-earnings ratios due to slowing growth concerns. Considering these points, the overall sentiment seems positive, indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on the rising trend of ISA millionaires and their investment patterns, particularly in blue-chip companies and diversified funds, which suggests a sustained interest in established stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Although the article does not mention Apple specifically, the overall positive sentiment among wealthy investors tends to favor large technology companies that have shown resilience. Previous predictions indicated a bullish outlook due to strong catalysts such as the AI advancements and product launches anticipated by Apple, combined with steady growth in their services segment. This aligns with the favorable trends highlighted in the ISA millionaire investments. Given the weight of recent positive sentiment and investment activity, I predict a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising, while acknowledging potential market fluctuations that may lead to a smaller chance of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news highlights BofA's positive outlook on Apple (AAPL) as a buying opportunity following a market sell-off driven by AI concerns. Apple's stock *rose* 3% during the sell-off, signifying investor confidence in its resilience and potential in 'edge AI.' BofA analysts cite several catalysts for potential upside, including upcoming iPhone releases, internal modem production, and AI integration possibilities highlighted at WWDC, and the fact that Apple is considered a 'flight to safety' during market volatility further bolsters the bullish outlook. Considering the positive BofA analysis, Apple outperforming the market during the sell-off, and upcoming catalysts, the probability of a price increase is higher than a decrease. Past predictions had varying ranges, some conservative, some bullish, with an upward tendancy.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a $4 trillion valuation prediction for Apple by 2025, but the article expresses skepticism.  This provides little direct impact on short-term price movements. While Warren Buffett's large holding suggests long-term confidence, it doesn't predict near-term volatility. Previous predictions show a range, with several models leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise, citing factors like analyst bullishness (BofA), strong sales in China (though with conflicting reports), and the potential of Apple to benefit from AI advancements. However, models also highlight concerns like market volatility, slowing growth, and the potential for disappointment from future product releases. Considering the lack of concrete news directly impacting Apple's fundamentals and the mixed signals reflected in the previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise reflecting the generally positive sentiment surrounding Apple, particularly its potential within the AI sector. However, the uncertainty inherent in market predictions, especially given the long-term nature of the $4 trillion projection, justifies a non-negligible probability for a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc., including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase to $250, expected revenue growth in the December quarter, and mid-single-digit percentage growth guidance for the March 2025 quarter. The development of advanced AI models, including Apple's AFM LLM, is seen as a catalyst for driving mobile device upgrades and consumer demand. Additionally, the Services segment is expected to see a 12% year-over-year revenue increase, indicating strong revenue diversification. While there are mentions of regulatory risks in 2025, the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a probability of 0.65 or higher for a price rise. Given the combination of bullish analyst sentiment, strong growth prospects, and AI innovation, the probability of the stock price rising is assessed to be high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports mixed signals about Apple's (AAPL) performance in China. IDC reported that iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter with a 17.4% market share, slightly above Huawei's 17.2%.

Analyst Dan Niles described the data as 'somewhat disappointing' and characterized the stock as 'pretty expensive'. Despite the mixed signals, the stock is up 4% today, indicating a positive short-term reaction to the IDC report. Considering these factors, there is a cautious outlook which might limit further gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for the technology sector, including Apple Inc., with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025. The portfolio manager's comments on the historical benefits of new product entries and the justification of current valuations with projected earnings growth contribute to a positive sentiment. However, the mentions of uncertainties and erosion of price-earnings ratios due to slowing growth concerns introduce some caution. Considering the overall positive tone and the trend of others' predictions, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising, I estimate a probability of stock price rise slightly above 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses investment patterns and portfolios of ISA millionaires in the UK, emphasizing a preference for traditional blue-chip stocks and diversified international investments. Although it provides insight into broad investment trends favoring stable, well-performing assets, it doesn't directly discuss Apple Inc.'s performance or prospects. The previous round's predictions suggest a mix of positive and neutral-to-negative signals regarding Apple's outlook. Considering the broad and indirect nature of the news and the diverse market sentiments, it's prudent to assign probabilities based on a neutral baseline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news discusses investment trends among ISA millionaires in the UK, highlighting a steady increase in investment in blue-chip companies and diversified funds. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned, the overall positive sentiment towards established, resilient stocks in diverse portfolios suggests potential capital inflow into tech stocks like Apple. Previous predictions indicated a general bullish outlook for Apple, driven by upcoming product launches and strong analyst sentiments. The overall context points towards a higher probability of a price increase, although some external pressures may still exist, maintaining a probability for a decrease. Therefore, based on these factors, I estimate an increased probability of stock price rise given the current positive investment climate among affluent investors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news is largely positive for Apple (AAPL). BofA sees a buying opportunity after a market dip, highlighting Apple's resilience and potential in 'edge AI'. Apple even increased by 3% while other AI stocks went down. Key catalysts for upside include upcoming iPhone releases, in-house modem production, and AI integration at the WWDC. BofA's bullish view provides a solid base along with multiple predictions of varying degrees, most on the high end of the range. Given this mix of both strong company specific bullish sentiment, news catalysts, and positive analysts coverage, I'm assigning a higher probability of a rise. The general bullish sentiment in previous predictions further increases this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price movement.  It focuses on a $4 trillion valuation prediction for Apple by 2025, presented with skepticism by the author.  This long-term prediction offers little insight into short-term price fluctuations. While Warren Buffett's significant Apple holdings suggest long-term confidence, it's not a predictor of immediate price changes.  The analysis of previous predictions shows a range of opinions, with a slight bias toward a price rise.  Several models point to positive factors such as analyst bullishness, promising sales figures (despite conflicting data from different sources), and Apple's potential in the AI sector.  However, counterpoints include market volatility, slowing growth concerns, and the possibility of disappointment from future product launches.  The lack of concrete news directly affecting Apple's fundamentals necessitates a relatively neutral prediction, slightly leaning toward a rise to reflect the overall, albeit somewhat mixed, positive sentiment surrounding Apple and its place within the AI space. The probability reflects both the positive indicators and the inherent uncertainties involved in market predictions, especially in light of the long-term nature of the $4 trillion valuation prospect.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase to $250, expected revenue growth in the December quarter, and mid-single-digit percentage growth guidance for the March 2025 quarter. The development of advanced AI models, including Apple's AFM LLM, is seen as a catalyst for driving mobile device upgrades and consumer demand. Additionally, the Services segment is expected to see a 12% year-over-year revenue increase, indicating strong revenue diversification. While there are mentions of regulatory risks in 2025, the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a probability of 0.65 or higher for a price rise. Given the combination of bullish analyst sentiment, strong growth prospects, and AI innovation, the probability of the stock price rising is assessed to be high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

This growth, combined with historical trends of new product entries benefiting the entire tech market, contributes to a positive sentiment. Although there are uncertainties and concerns about slowing growth, the overall tone is optimistic. Previous predictions from other models generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with probabilities often above 0.6. Given the positive outlook and the trend in others' predictions, I estimate a probability of stock price rise slightly above 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses investment patterns and portfolios of ISA millionaires in the UK, emphasizing a preference for traditional blue-chip stocks and diversified international investments.
