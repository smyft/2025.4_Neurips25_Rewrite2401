      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news does not directly comment on Apple Inc. but focuses on ISA millionaires investing in various stocks and funds. The prominence of technology stocks, including Apple, in the investment strategies of these wealthier investors suggests potential continued interest and capital inflow towards technology, which could support Apple's stock price. However, general market fluctuations and sector weaknesses may still pose risks. Given the context, there's a moderate probability of a price rise due to sustained investment interest among affluent investors, coupled with a lower probability of a significant decline due to external pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) from Bank of America. Despite a broader market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's AI breakthrough, Apple's stock *rose* 3%, suggesting investor confidence in its resilience and potential in edge AI. BofA analysts cite several upcoming catalysts for Apple, including the potential launch of iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, WWDC with focus on AI applications and even the future iPhone 17 release. The defensive nature of the stock and investors moving toward stocks with resilient earning makes BofA think a buying opportunity has presented itself for Apple. Moreover, the belief that Apple could benefit from the Deepseek AI advancement, especially the implication that AI inferencing cost could drop and new development will be accelerated, is another factor that might further boost Apple's stock prices as an LLM device leader. The news is very bullish for AAPL given the specific rationale and potential catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a prediction of Apple reaching a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, a significant increase from its current market cap.  However, this is presented as an opinion piece, with the author expressing skepticism.  The article doesn't provide concrete new information about Apple's fundamentals or performance that would definitively drive the stock price up or down. The mention of Warren Buffett's holdings is relevant but not directly indicative of future price movements; his continued investment reflects long-term confidence but doesn't predict short-term volatility. Therefore, the news itself has limited impact on predicting immediate stock price movement. The probability of a price increase or decrease is mostly driven by existing market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the provided news.  I'm assuming a neutral baseline probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc., including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase, expected revenue growth, and advancements in AI technology that could drive future demand. The Services segment's robust growth also indicates revenue diversification. While there are mentions of regulatory risks, the overall sentiment is positive, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports mixed signals about Apple's (AAPL) performance in China. On one hand, a research firm, IDC, reported that iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter with a 17.4% market share, slightly above Huawei's 17.2%. This information could potentially boost investor confidence and contribute to a rise in stock price. On the other hand, another research firm, Counterpoint, stated that iPhone's market share was 17.1% in China, placing it in third place, and noted an 18.2% decline in devices handed over by Apple in China compared to the same period a year earlier. Additionally, analyst Dan Niles described the data as 'somewhat disappointing' and characterized the stock as 'pretty expensive'. Given these mixed signals, the stock is currently up 4%, indicating a positive short-term reaction to the IDC report. However, considering the overall performance and analyst comments, there is a cautious outlook which might limit further gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article mentions that the technology sector, including Big Tech companies like Apple, is expected to experience 20% earnings growth in 2025 according to a portfolio manager. This projection is despite initial concerns about the impact of new AI models on the sector. Historically, new product entries have created increased demand, benefiting the entire tech market. Additionally, the portfolio manager notes that the current valuations can be justified with the projected earnings growth. However, there are also mentions of uncertainties and erosion of price-earnings ratios due to slowing growth concerns. Considering these points, the overall sentiment seems positive, indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on the rising trend of ISA millionaires and their investment patterns, particularly in blue-chip companies and diversified funds, which suggests a sustained interest in established stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Although the article does not mention Apple specifically, the overall positive sentiment among wealthy investors tends to favor large technology companies that have shown resilience. Previous predictions indicated a bullish outlook due to strong catalysts such as the AI advancements and product launches anticipated by Apple, combined with steady growth in their services segment. This aligns with the favorable trends highlighted in the ISA millionaire investments. Given the weight of recent positive sentiment and investment activity, I predict a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising, while acknowledging potential market fluctuations that may lead to a smaller chance of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news highlights BofA's positive outlook on Apple (AAPL) as a buying opportunity following a market sell-off driven by AI concerns. Apple's stock *rose* 3% during the sell-off, signifying investor confidence in its resilience and potential in 'edge AI.' BofA analysts cite several catalysts for potential upside, including upcoming iPhone releases, internal modem production, and AI integration possibilities highlighted at WWDC, and the fact that Apple is considered a 'flight to safety' during market volatility further bolsters the bullish outlook. Considering the positive BofA analysis, Apple outperforming the market during the sell-off, and upcoming catalysts, the probability of a price increase is higher than a decrease. Past predictions had varying ranges, some conservative, some bullish, with an upward tendancy.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a $4 trillion valuation prediction for Apple by 2025, but the article expresses skepticism.  This provides little direct impact on short-term price movements. While Warren Buffett's large holding suggests long-term confidence, it doesn't predict near-term volatility. Previous predictions show a range, with several models leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise, citing factors like analyst bullishness (BofA), strong sales in China (though with conflicting reports), and the potential of Apple to benefit from AI advancements. However, models also highlight concerns like market volatility, slowing growth, and the potential for disappointment from future product releases. Considering the lack of concrete news directly impacting Apple's fundamentals and the mixed signals reflected in the previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise reflecting the generally positive sentiment surrounding Apple, particularly its potential within the AI sector. However, the uncertainty inherent in market predictions, especially given the long-term nature of the $4 trillion projection, justifies a non-negligible probability for a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc., including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase to $250, expected revenue growth in the December quarter, and mid-single-digit percentage growth guidance for the March 2025 quarter. The development of advanced AI models, including Apple's AFM LLM, is seen as a catalyst for driving mobile device upgrades and consumer demand. Additionally, the Services segment is expected to see a 12% year-over-year revenue increase, indicating strong revenue diversification. While there are mentions of regulatory risks in 2025, the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a probability of 0.65 or higher for a price rise. Given the combination of bullish analyst sentiment, strong growth prospects, and AI innovation, the probability of the stock price rising is assessed to be high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports mixed signals about Apple's (AAPL) performance in China. IDC reported that iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter with a 17.4% market share, slightly above Huawei's 17.2%. This could boost investor confidence and contribute to a rise in stock price. However, Counterpoint stated that iPhone's market share was 17.1% in China, placing it in third place, and noted an 18.2% decline in devices handed over by Apple in China compared to the same period a year earlier. Analyst Dan Niles described the data as 'somewhat disappointing' and characterized the stock as 'pretty expensive'. Despite the mixed signals, the stock is up 4% today, indicating a positive short-term reaction to the IDC report. Considering these factors, there is a cautious outlook which might limit further gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for the technology sector, including Apple Inc., with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025. The portfolio manager's comments on the historical benefits of new product entries and the justification of current valuations with projected earnings growth contribute to a positive sentiment. However, the mentions of uncertainties and erosion of price-earnings ratios due to slowing growth concerns introduce some caution. Considering the overall positive tone and the trend of others' predictions, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising, I estimate a probability of stock price rise slightly above 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses investment patterns and portfolios of ISA millionaires in the UK, emphasizing a preference for traditional blue-chip stocks and diversified international investments. Although it provides insight into broad investment trends favoring stable, well-performing assets, it doesn't directly discuss Apple Inc.'s performance or prospects. The previous round's predictions suggest a mix of positive and neutral-to-negative signals regarding Apple's outlook. Considering the broad and indirect nature of the news and the diverse market sentiments, it's prudent to assign probabilities based on a neutral baseline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
