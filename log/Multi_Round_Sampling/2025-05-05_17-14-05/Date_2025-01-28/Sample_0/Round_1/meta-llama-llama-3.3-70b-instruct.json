(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why AAPL Is Climbing Today\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) is advancing 4% today after a research firm reported that the company's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter. Earlier this month, another research firm stated that AAPL had dropped to third place in terms of smartphone market share in the Asian country.Dan Niles on Apple (AAPL): Data is \u2018Somewhat Disappointing\u2019 and Stock is \u2018Pretty Expensive\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nThe iPhone Was Reportedly the Q4 Market Share Leader in China\n\nThe device's market share in China came in at 17.4% last quarter, the International Data Corporation (IDC) reported. That was slightly above second-place Huawei's 17.2% share. However, the device's market share was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, when it controlled 20% of the market. Further, for all of 2024, its market share dropped to 15.6% from 17.4% in 2023.\n\nLast week, another research firm, Counterpoint, reported that the iPhone's market share had been 17.1% in China last quarter, leaving the device in third place in the huge market. Counterpoint added that the number of devices handed over by Apple in China had tumbled 18.2% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier. In Q4 of 2023, iPhone's market share was 20.2%.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of AAPL Stock\n\nIn the last month, the shares have fallen 4.5%, while they are up 2.5% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline and content suggest a positive sentiment towards Apple and its peers (Nvidia and AMD) by referring to them as 'millionaire-makers.' This implies strong past performance and potential future growth, likely leading investors to have a bullish outlook on AAPL. As such, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the EPS estimate suggests 8% year-over-year growth, top-line growth has been stagnant. Key metrics to watch include China sales (previously a weak point, now showing potential positive YoY change), Services revenue (historically robust but with a recent miss), and iPhone sales influenced by the adoption of Apple Intelligence. The article highlights analyst bearishness with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating. The outcome hinges on commentary, guidance, and Apple Intelligence adoption. A combination of factors, including slight positive projections offset by overall bearish sentiment leads to an expectation of marginally higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success raises concerns about the future of AI spending and could indirectly impact Apple through reduced demand for its hardware (especially considering its top spot on the App Store), several factors mitigate the negative impact.  Firstly, Apple's earnings announcement is imminent, and positive results could overshadow the DeepSeek news. Secondly, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments highlight that the demand for more powerful AI models remains strong, suggesting that the concerns might be overblown in the long run.  Finally, the immediate market reaction (Nasdaq futures inching up after a sell-off) suggests a degree of resilience and possibly a short-term overreaction to the DeepSeek news. The probabilities assigned reflect this balanced perspective; while there's a risk of a short-term dip, the overall outlook remains relatively neutral, leaning slightly towards a potential rise due to upcoming earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the easing of a tech sell-off, particularly in the context of AI investments by Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The initial sell-off was triggered by concerns over DeepSeek AI's innovations potentially reducing AI spending. However, Dom Rizzo from T. Rowe Price suggests that medium-term compute and GPU intensity could actually increase, which may benefit companies like Apple that are heavily invested in AI. While short-term volatility may persist, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. Given Apple's position in the tech sector and its focus on AI, the stock is likely to react positively to the easing sell-off and the potential for increased AI investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). They highlight Apple's defensive nature, its potential for growth amid market volatility, and specific factors such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Additionally, BofA analysts believe that if DeepSeek's AI breakthrough leads to lower AI-related spending, Apple could benefit from edge AI applications. Given these positive factors, it seems that the news is more likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive indicator for the company's stock price. However, the report also mentions that the device's market share in China was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, and that another research firm had reported a drop in market share. Additionally, an expert, Dan Niles, has stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall movement is expected to be moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
