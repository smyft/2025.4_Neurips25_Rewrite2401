(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline and content suggest a positive sentiment towards Apple and its peers (Nvidia and AMD) by referring to them as 'millionaire-makers.' This implies strong past performance and potential future growth, likely leading investors to have a bullish outlook on AAPL. As such, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the EPS estimate suggests 8% year-over-year growth, top-line growth has been stagnant. Key metrics to watch include China sales (previously a weak point, now showing potential positive YoY change), Services revenue (historically robust but with a recent miss), and iPhone sales influenced by the adoption of Apple Intelligence. The article highlights analyst bearishness with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating. The outcome hinges on commentary, guidance, and Apple Intelligence adoption. A combination of factors, including slight positive projections offset by overall bearish sentiment leads to an expectation of marginally higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success raises concerns about the future of AI spending and could indirectly impact Apple through reduced demand for its hardware (especially considering its top spot on the App Store), several factors mitigate the negative impact.  Firstly, Apple's earnings announcement is imminent, and positive results could overshadow the DeepSeek news. Secondly, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments highlight that the demand for more powerful AI models remains strong, suggesting that the concerns might be overblown in the long run.  Finally, the immediate market reaction (Nasdaq futures inching up after a sell-off) suggests a degree of resilience and possibly a short-term overreaction to the DeepSeek news. The probabilities assigned reflect this balanced perspective; while there's a risk of a short-term dip, the overall outlook remains relatively neutral, leaning slightly towards a potential rise due to upcoming earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the easing of a tech sell-off, particularly in the context of AI investments by Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The initial sell-off was triggered by concerns over DeepSeek AI's innovations potentially reducing AI spending. However, Dom Rizzo from T. Rowe Price suggests that medium-term compute and GPU intensity could actually increase, which may benefit companies like Apple that are heavily invested in AI. While short-term volatility may persist, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. Given Apple's position in the tech sector and its focus on AI, the stock is likely to react positively to the easing sell-off and the potential for increased AI investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). They highlight Apple's defensive nature, its potential for growth amid market volatility, and specific factors such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Additionally, BofA analysts believe that if DeepSeek's AI breakthrough leads to lower AI-related spending, Apple could benefit from edge AI applications. Given these positive factors, it seems that the news is more likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive indicator for the company's stock price. However, the report also mentions that the device's market share in China was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, and that another research firm had reported a drop in market share. Additionally, an expert, Dan Niles, has stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall movement is expected to be moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline positions Apple alongside Nvidia and AMD, referring to them as 'millionaire-makers,' which evokes a positive sentiment and suggests historical strong performance. This optimism may translate into a bullish outlook from investors. Although there are mixed signals from previous analyses, the general tone of the news favors potential growth rather than decline. Recent insights into Apple's defensive nature, its technological advancements, and anticipated product launches contribute further to a favorable outlook. Therefore, I assign a higher probability of the stock price rising, coupled with a lower probability for falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, shares are down 8% YTD, and analyst revisions are largely unchanged with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating bearishness. China results are a key concern due to past underperformance. On the other hand, China sales are forecasted to show the first positive YoY change in several periods. Services are regularly robust, and focus shifts to adoption of new iphone features. Considering the mixed signals and previous round predictions trending toward neutral/slightly negative, the probability of a fall is slightly higher given negative Zacks Rank and YTD performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a complex picture for Apple.  The DeepSeek AI model's success creates uncertainty about future AI spending, potentially impacting Apple's hardware sales and the overall tech sector.  However, several factors mitigate this negative impact.  The Nasdaq futures are up after a sell-off, suggesting a possible overreaction. Nvidia\u2019s after-hours recovery shows some resilience in the tech sector.  OpenAI's CEO acknowledging DeepSeek's achievement but emphasizing the continued importance of high-powered AI computes points toward ongoing demand for high-end technology, ultimately benefitting Apple. Apple's upcoming earnings report is a significant catalyst; positive results could overshadow the DeepSeek news and drive the stock price up.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation.  Considering the upcoming earnings report and the overall context, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher, although the situation remains uncertain and could easily swing either way.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off easing and its implications for Big Tech's AI spending, with a focus on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The initial sell-off was driven by concerns over DeepSeek AI's innovations potentially reducing AI spending, but Dom Rizzo from T. Rowe Price suggests medium-term compute and GPU intensity could increase, benefiting companies like Apple. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and its focus on AI, the easing sell-off and potential for increased AI investment are likely to have a positive impact. However, short-term volatility may persist. Considering the mixed but generally positive signals from the news and the previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). They highlight Apple's defensive nature, its potential for growth amid market volatility, and specific factors such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Additionally, BofA analysts believe that if DeepSeek's AI breakthrough leads to lower AI-related spending, Apple could benefit from edge AI applications. Given these positive factors, it seems that the news is more likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive indicator for the company's stock price. However, the report also mentions that the device's market share in China was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, and that another research firm had reported a drop in market share. Additionally, an expert, Dan Niles, has stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall movement is expected to be moderate. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most of them assign a higher probability to the stock price rising. Taking into account the positive news about iPhone sales in China and the mixed opinions from other models, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.58, and the estimated probability of the stock price falling is 0.42.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline emphasizes Apple alongside Nvidia and AMD as 'millionaire-makers,' which tends to create a positive sentiment around the stock. Previous analyses show a range of opinions, with several models projecting probabilities significantly favoring a rise in Apple's stock price. Factors reinforcing this outlook include anticipated product launches and Apple's defensive market positioning amid macroeconomic challenges. However, there are mixed signals regarding sales in China and overall market performance, which introduce some caution. Ultimately, the overarching message remains optimistic, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the EPS estimate suggests 8% year-over-year growth, revenue growth has been sluggish. China sales are a significant point to watch, as past performance has been weak, but the forecast indicates positive year-over-year change, a potential positive catalyst. Services continue to be strong, but iPhone sales and the adoption of 'Apple Intelligence' are critical drivers, carrying risk and opportunity. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflects bearish analyst sentiment. Considering conflicting data, positive forecasts for China sales and the importance of adoption rate of Apple Intelligence, I slightly lean towards a neutral to positive outlook. I am also taking into consideration of previous rounds of prediction which seems to be fluctuating between slightly positive and slightly negative. I am balancing these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model has created uncertainty regarding future AI spending, potentially impacting demand for Apple's high-end hardware.  However, several factors mitigate this negative impact.  The Nasdaq futures are up, suggesting the market may have overreacted to the initial DeepSeek news. Nvidia's after-hours recovery also shows resilience in the tech sector. OpenAI's CEO's comments highlight continued demand for powerful AI, which remains positive for Apple's long-term prospects.  Apple's upcoming earnings announcement is a key catalyst; strong results could easily overshadow the DeepSeek concerns. The prior predictions are quite varied, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation. Considering these factors and the upcoming earnings report, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise, though the uncertainty remains high.  The fact that DeepSeek's app topped the App Store charts suggests that it may be more a disruption to the software business model than necessarily an immediate threat to Apple's hardware sales. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic because of Apple's strong brand and upcoming earnings report, thus more likely to see positive movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the easing of a tech sell-off, particularly in the context of AI investments by Big Tech, including Apple Inc.

While short-term volatility may persist, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. Given Apple's position in the tech sector and its focus on AI, the stock is likely to react positively to the easing sell-off and the potential for increased AI investment. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most assign a higher probability to the stock price rising. Considering the positive medium-term outlook and Apple's strong position, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc.

(AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. There are positive signals such as the potential benefits from increased AI investment, improved services, and recent product launches. However, there are also bearish sentiments due to analyst downgrades, concerns over iPhone shipments, and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating.
