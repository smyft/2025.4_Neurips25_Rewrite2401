(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\nNews Content: This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) : Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline and content suggest a positive sentiment towards Apple and its peers (Nvidia and AMD) by referring to them as 'millionaire-makers.' This implies strong past performance and potential future growth, likely leading investors to have a bullish outlook on AAPL. As such, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the EPS estimate suggests 8% year-over-year growth, top-line growth has been stagnant. Key metrics to watch include China sales (previously a weak point, now showing potential positive YoY change), Services revenue (historically robust but with a recent miss), and iPhone sales influenced by the adoption of Apple Intelligence. The article highlights analyst bearishness with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating. The outcome hinges on commentary, guidance, and Apple Intelligence adoption. A combination of factors, including slight positive projections offset by overall bearish sentiment leads to an expectation of marginally higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success raises concerns about the future of AI spending and could indirectly impact Apple through reduced demand for its hardware (especially considering its top spot on the App Store), several factors mitigate the negative impact.  Firstly, Apple's earnings announcement is imminent, and positive results could overshadow the DeepSeek news. Secondly, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments highlight that the demand for more powerful AI models remains strong, suggesting that the concerns might be overblown in the long run.  Finally, the immediate market reaction (Nasdaq futures inching up after a sell-off) suggests a degree of resilience and possibly a short-term overreaction to the DeepSeek news. The probabilities assigned reflect this balanced perspective; while there's a risk of a short-term dip, the overall outlook remains relatively neutral, leaning slightly towards a potential rise due to upcoming earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the easing of a tech sell-off, particularly in the context of AI investments by Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The initial sell-off was triggered by concerns over DeepSeek AI's innovations potentially reducing AI spending. However, Dom Rizzo from T. Rowe Price suggests that medium-term compute and GPU intensity could actually increase, which may benefit companies like Apple that are heavily invested in AI. While short-term volatility may persist, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. Given Apple's position in the tech sector and its focus on AI, the stock is likely to react positively to the easing sell-off and the potential for increased AI investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). They highlight Apple's defensive nature, its potential for growth amid market volatility, and specific factors such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Additionally, BofA analysts believe that if DeepSeek's AI breakthrough leads to lower AI-related spending, Apple could benefit from edge AI applications. Given these positive factors, it seems that the news is more likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive indicator for the company's stock price. However, the report also mentions that the device's market share in China was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, and that another research firm had reported a drop in market share. Additionally, an expert, Dan Niles, has stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall movement is expected to be moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline positions Apple alongside Nvidia and AMD, referring to them as 'millionaire-makers,' which evokes a positive sentiment and suggests historical strong performance. This optimism may translate into a bullish outlook from investors. Although there are mixed signals from previous analyses, the general tone of the news favors potential growth rather than decline. Recent insights into Apple's defensive nature, its technological advancements, and anticipated product launches contribute further to a favorable outlook. Therefore, I assign a higher probability of the stock price rising, coupled with a lower probability for falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, shares are down 8% YTD, and analyst revisions are largely unchanged with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating bearishness. China results are a key concern due to past underperformance. On the other hand, China sales are forecasted to show the first positive YoY change in several periods. Services are regularly robust, and focus shifts to adoption of new iphone features. Considering the mixed signals and previous round predictions trending toward neutral/slightly negative, the probability of a fall is slightly higher given negative Zacks Rank and YTD performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a complex picture for Apple.  The DeepSeek AI model's success creates uncertainty about future AI spending, potentially impacting Apple's hardware sales and the overall tech sector.  However, several factors mitigate this negative impact.  The Nasdaq futures are up after a sell-off, suggesting a possible overreaction. Nvidia\u2019s after-hours recovery shows some resilience in the tech sector.  OpenAI's CEO acknowledging DeepSeek's achievement but emphasizing the continued importance of high-powered AI computes points toward ongoing demand for high-end technology, ultimately benefitting Apple. Apple's upcoming earnings report is a significant catalyst; positive results could overshadow the DeepSeek news and drive the stock price up.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation.  Considering the upcoming earnings report and the overall context, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher, although the situation remains uncertain and could easily swing either way.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off easing and its implications for Big Tech's AI spending, with a focus on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The initial sell-off was driven by concerns over DeepSeek AI's innovations potentially reducing AI spending, but Dom Rizzo from T. Rowe Price suggests medium-term compute and GPU intensity could increase, benefiting companies like Apple. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and its focus on AI, the easing sell-off and potential for increased AI investment are likely to have a positive impact. However, short-term volatility may persist. Considering the mixed but generally positive signals from the news and the previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). They highlight Apple's defensive nature, its potential for growth amid market volatility, and specific factors such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Additionally, BofA analysts believe that if DeepSeek's AI breakthrough leads to lower AI-related spending, Apple could benefit from edge AI applications. Given these positive factors, it seems that the news is more likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive indicator for the company's stock price. However, the report also mentions that the device's market share in China was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, and that another research firm had reported a drop in market share. Additionally, an expert, Dan Niles, has stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall movement is expected to be moderate. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most of them assign a higher probability to the stock price rising. Taking into account the positive news about iPhone sales in China and the mixed opinions from other models, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.58, and the estimated probability of the stock price falling is 0.42.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline emphasizes Apple alongside Nvidia and AMD as 'millionaire-makers,' which tends to create a positive sentiment around the stock. Previous analyses show a range of opinions, with several models projecting probabilities significantly favoring a rise in Apple's stock price. Factors reinforcing this outlook include anticipated product launches and Apple's defensive market positioning amid macroeconomic challenges. However, there are mixed signals regarding sales in China and overall market performance, which introduce some caution. Ultimately, the overarching message remains optimistic, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the EPS estimate suggests 8% year-over-year growth, revenue growth has been sluggish. China sales are a significant point to watch, as past performance has been weak, but the forecast indicates positive year-over-year change, a potential positive catalyst. Services continue to be strong, but iPhone sales and the adoption of 'Apple Intelligence' are critical drivers, carrying risk and opportunity. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflects bearish analyst sentiment. Considering conflicting data, positive forecasts for China sales and the importance of adoption rate of Apple Intelligence, I slightly lean towards a neutral to positive outlook. I am also taking into consideration of previous rounds of prediction which seems to be fluctuating between slightly positive and slightly negative. I am balancing these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model has created uncertainty regarding future AI spending, potentially impacting demand for Apple's high-end hardware.  However, several factors mitigate this negative impact.  The Nasdaq futures are up, suggesting the market may have overreacted to the initial DeepSeek news. Nvidia's after-hours recovery also shows resilience in the tech sector. OpenAI's CEO's comments highlight continued demand for powerful AI, which remains positive for Apple's long-term prospects.  Apple's upcoming earnings announcement is a key catalyst; strong results could easily overshadow the DeepSeek concerns. The prior predictions are quite varied, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation. Considering these factors and the upcoming earnings report, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise, though the uncertainty remains high.  The fact that DeepSeek's app topped the App Store charts suggests that it may be more a disruption to the software business model than necessarily an immediate threat to Apple's hardware sales. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic because of Apple's strong brand and upcoming earnings report, thus more likely to see positive movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the easing of a tech sell-off, particularly in the context of AI investments by Big Tech, including Apple Inc.

Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most assign a higher probability to the stock price rising. Considering the positive medium-term outlook and Apple's strong position, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc.

Taking into account the positive news about iPhone sales in China and the mixed opinions from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.6 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.4.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. There are positive signals such as the potential benefits from increased AI investment, improved services, and recent product launches. However, there are also bearish sentiments due to analyst downgrades, concerns over iPhone shipments, and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating. The overall sentiment leans positive with potential short-term volatility due to these mixed factors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
