(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline and content suggest a positive sentiment towards Apple and its peers (Nvidia and AMD) by referring to them as 'millionaire-makers.' This implies strong past performance and potential future growth, likely leading investors to have a bullish outlook on AAPL. As such, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the EPS estimate suggests 8% year-over-year growth, top-line growth has been stagnant. Key metrics to watch include China sales (previously a weak point, now showing potential positive YoY change), Services revenue (historically robust but with a recent miss), and iPhone sales influenced by the adoption of Apple Intelligence. The article highlights analyst bearishness with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating. The outcome hinges on commentary, guidance, and Apple Intelligence adoption. A combination of factors, including slight positive projections offset by overall bearish sentiment leads to an expectation of marginally higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success raises concerns about the future of AI spending and could indirectly impact Apple through reduced demand for its hardware (especially considering its top spot on the App Store), several factors mitigate the negative impact.  Firstly, Apple's earnings announcement is imminent, and positive results could overshadow the DeepSeek news. Secondly, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments highlight that the demand for more powerful AI models remains strong, suggesting that the concerns might be overblown in the long run.  Finally, the immediate market reaction (Nasdaq futures inching up after a sell-off) suggests a degree of resilience and possibly a short-term overreaction to the DeepSeek news. The probabilities assigned reflect this balanced perspective; while there's a risk of a short-term dip, the overall outlook remains relatively neutral, leaning slightly towards a potential rise due to upcoming earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the easing of a tech sell-off, particularly in the context of AI investments by Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The initial sell-off was triggered by concerns over DeepSeek AI's innovations potentially reducing AI spending. However, Dom Rizzo from T. Rowe Price suggests that medium-term compute and GPU intensity could actually increase, which may benefit companies like Apple that are heavily invested in AI. While short-term volatility may persist, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. Given Apple's position in the tech sector and its focus on AI, the stock is likely to react positively to the easing sell-off and the potential for increased AI investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). They highlight Apple's defensive nature, its potential for growth amid market volatility, and specific factors such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Additionally, BofA analysts believe that if DeepSeek's AI breakthrough leads to lower AI-related spending, Apple could benefit from edge AI applications. Given these positive factors, it seems that the news is more likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive indicator for the company's stock price. However, the report also mentions that the device's market share in China was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, and that another research firm had reported a drop in market share. Additionally, an expert, Dan Niles, has stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall movement is expected to be moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline positions Apple alongside Nvidia and AMD, referring to them as 'millionaire-makers,' which evokes a positive sentiment and suggests historical strong performance. This optimism may translate into a bullish outlook from investors. Although there are mixed signals from previous analyses, the general tone of the news favors potential growth rather than decline. Recent insights into Apple's defensive nature, its technological advancements, and anticipated product launches contribute further to a favorable outlook. Therefore, I assign a higher probability of the stock price rising, coupled with a lower probability for falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, shares are down 8% YTD, and analyst revisions are largely unchanged with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating bearishness. China results are a key concern due to past underperformance. On the other hand, China sales are forecasted to show the first positive YoY change in several periods. Services are regularly robust, and focus shifts to adoption of new iphone features. Considering the mixed signals and previous round predictions trending toward neutral/slightly negative, the probability of a fall is slightly higher given negative Zacks Rank and YTD performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a complex picture for Apple.  The DeepSeek AI model's success creates uncertainty about future AI spending, potentially impacting Apple's hardware sales and the overall tech sector.  However, several factors mitigate this negative impact.  The Nasdaq futures are up after a sell-off, suggesting a possible overreaction. Nvidia\u2019s after-hours recovery shows some resilience in the tech sector.  OpenAI's CEO acknowledging DeepSeek's achievement but emphasizing the continued importance of high-powered AI computes points toward ongoing demand for high-end technology, ultimately benefitting Apple. Apple's upcoming earnings report is a significant catalyst; positive results could overshadow the DeepSeek news and drive the stock price up.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation.  Considering the upcoming earnings report and the overall context, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher, although the situation remains uncertain and could easily swing either way.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off easing and its implications for Big Tech's AI spending, with a focus on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The initial sell-off was driven by concerns over DeepSeek AI's innovations potentially reducing AI spending, but Dom Rizzo from T. Rowe Price suggests medium-term compute and GPU intensity could increase, benefiting companies like Apple. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and its focus on AI, the easing sell-off and potential for increased AI investment are likely to have a positive impact. However, short-term volatility may persist. Considering the mixed but generally positive signals from the news and the previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Bank of America (BofA) analysts view the recent sell-off in the market as a buying opportunity for certain stocks, including Apple Inc.

Given these positive factors, it seems that the news is more likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive indicator for the company's stock price. However, the report also mentions that the device's market share in China was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, and that another research firm had reported a drop in market share. Additionally, an expert, Dan Niles, has stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall movement is expected to be moderate. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most of them assign a higher probability to the stock price rising. Taking into account the positive news about iPhone sales in China and the mixed opinions from other models, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.58, and the estimated probability of the stock price falling is 0.42.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
