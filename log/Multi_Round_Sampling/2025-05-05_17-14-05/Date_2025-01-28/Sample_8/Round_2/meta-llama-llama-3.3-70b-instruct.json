(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant valuation potential, especially tied to Warren Buffett's confidence in the company. A projection of reaching a $4 trillion valuation in 2025 suggests strong future growth. However, the article's indication of skepticism could introduce uncertainty among investors. Markets tend to react positively to news about growth prospects, hence I estimate a higher probability for a stock price rise, balanced by a lower probability of a fall due to the doubts raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple as one of the 'Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks'. This suggests a positive historical performance and potential for future growth. However, the article does not contain concrete information about any specific catalyst that would cause an immediate price movement. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could also imply that Apple is part of a broader tech trend and may experience correlated movements. Since the news is generally positive but lacks any tangible, actionable information about Apple specifically, the probability of a significant rise is moderate, and the probability of a fall remains relatively low due to existing positive sentiment about the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a question about whether to buy Apple stock before January 30th.  The article body highlights Apple's strong financial performance ('printing money') but also mentions its above-average valuation. This creates a conflicting signal. While strong financials are bullish, a high valuation suggests the stock price may be susceptible to a decline if growth slows or if investors shift to less expensive alternatives. The lack of specific information in the news snippet makes it difficult to assign precise probabilities.  Therefore, the probabilities are approximated by acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator for the stock. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an above-average valuation, which could deter some investors due to potential overvaluation concerns. The balance between strong financial performance and high valuation leads to a neutral to slightly positive outlook. The probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, given Apple's consistent performance and brand strength, but the high valuation caps the upside potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and its potential impact on the stock price. The stock has had a rough start to 2025, down 8%, and is currently ranked #4 (Sell) by Zacks. Key metrics to watch include China's sales results, Services segment performance, and iPhone sales, particularly related to Apple Intelligence. While some metrics like Services show growth, overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, suggesting a stable but not overly optimistic outlook. Given the mixed expectations and the stock's current underperformance, there is a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling if the earnings report fails to meet expectations or provide positive guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI industry. Cramer believes that the consensus estimates for AAPL are too high and that a potential earnings miss is already priced in. He also expresses skepticism about the consumer demand for AI PCs, but remains bullish on AI technology in general. Given that Cramer's comments are somewhat neutral and do not contain any major positive or negative surprises, the overall impact on the stock price is likely to be limited. However, the fact that Cramer believes the potential earnings miss is already priced in could lead to a slight increase in the stock price if the actual earnings are not as bad as expected.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant valuation potential, supported by Warren Buffett's confidence, which tends to influence investor sentiment positively. However, the skepticism expressed in the article creates a level of uncertainty. Previous predictions show mixed to positive views, but the prevailing theme is cautious optimism due to Apple's strong financial performance and existing market position. Considering the overall positive sentiment combined with the skepticism, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise, albeit tempered by a reasonable chance of a decline due to the highlighted doubts and potential valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline presents Apple positively by associating it with 'Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks,' implying past success and future potential. While the news is not specific to any recent development, its positive framing likely boosts investor sentiment. Considering previous opinions, the models' predictions vary, implying conflicting interpretations and information asymmetry. The rise predictions range from 0.45-0.65. Considering there's no major near-term catalyst this represents a more generic assessment and a potential for a short-term slight boost/neutral effect of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While its strong financial performance is positive, the mention of above-average valuation introduces a countervailing factor.  Previous predictions are also varied, ranging from a strong belief in a price rise to a strong belief in a price fall.  Several models highlighted the lack of concrete information as a major factor influencing prediction difficulty.  The absence of specific catalysts or significant news regarding the company complicates a definitive prediction. Given the ambiguity, and the divergence in previous model predictions, a cautious neutral stance is adopted, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to Apple's historical strength and continued revenue generation.  However, the high valuation remains a risk.  The probability percentages reflect this uncertainty and cautious optimism.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple is described as a 'premium smartphone brand' that is 'still printing money,' which suggests strong financial performance and brand strength. On the other hand, the mention of an 'above-average valuation' introduces a note of caution, as high valuations can deter investors concerned about overvaluation. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive (e.g., 0.55-0.65 probability of rise) and others more neutral or slightly negative (e.g., 0.45 probability of rise). The lack of a specific catalyst in the news and the mixed signals (strong fundamentals vs. high valuation) suggest a balanced outlook. Apple's consistent performance and brand strength likely mitigate some downside risk, but the high valuation caps upside potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI industry. Cramer believes that the consensus estimates for AAPL are too high and that a potential earnings miss is already priced in. He also expresses skepticism about the consumer demand for AI PCs, but remains bullish on AI technology in general. Given that Cramer's comments are somewhat neutral and do not contain any major positive or negative surprises, the overall impact on the stock price is likely to be limited. However, considering the trend of others' predictions, which show a varied outlook but generally a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong brand and financial performance, I will take a balanced approach. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, from a higher probability of a rise to a higher probability of a fall, indicating uncertainty and the need for a cautious estimate. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability for both a rise and a fall, reflecting the mixed expectations and the lack of concrete information in the news that would significantly sway the stock price in either direction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as a bullish analyst target, projected revenue growth, and prospects in AI innovation. These factors suggest a positive outlook for the stock. Previous predictions indicate a mix of views with a slight bias towards an upward movement, though with varying degrees of confidence. The recent 4% rally indicates market approval of the news. However, it's important to consider the potential challenges mentioned, such as regulatory risks and valuation concerns. Overall, the news points towards more positive sentiments, albeit with some caution.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
