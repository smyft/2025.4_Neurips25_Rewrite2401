      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: OpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov as industry reels from DeepSeek's breakout\nNews Content: OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project. Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attended the unveiling. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe move further cements OpenAI's partnership with the US government, positioning its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership.\n\nLast week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office. Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on X @hshaban.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Despite the positive news regarding Apple's iPhones being the best-selling smartphone in China for Q4, there are concerning trends in market share compared to previous quarters. The decline in market share from Q4 2023 to 2024 suggests a weakening position. Furthermore, earlier reports indicated that Apple had dropped to third place in market share. While the recent stock price increase may indicate some short-term optimism, the overall context of declining market presence and the commentary on Apple's stock being perceived as 'pretty expensive' by Dan Niles may temper bullish sentiment. Therefore, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative long-term trends outweighing the positive aspects of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While strong performance and new product releases are positives, concerns about overvaluation, geopolitical risks (China/Taiwan, potential trade wars), and anti-trust issues create headwinds. Buffett's sale of Apple shares, though potentially tax-related, also introduces uncertainty. The article suggests a flat share price target for the next 12 months from GuruFocus. Considering both positive and negative potential impacts equally using the available information, it's reasonable to provide a 50-50 weighting to both probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple stock ('AAPL') surged as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group.  This is positive news and suggests recent strong performance. However, the headline is relatively vague and doesn't provide specific details about the reasons for the surge or the magnitude of the price movement. The lack of specifics makes assigning precise probabilities difficult.  I am assigning a higher probability to a price rise given the headline's positive tone, but acknowledging that the information is insufficient to be highly confident.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a retrospective analysis of Q3 earnings for consumer electronics stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's performance was mixed, with revenues slightly exceeding analysts' expectations but with a miss in the Services segment. Despite this, Apple's stock price increased by 2% post-earnings, indicating some investor confidence. The broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the muted reaction of consumer electronics stocks overall and the specific mixed results for Apple suggest cautious optimism rather than strong bullish sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its quarterly earnings, and the stock has been underperforming, down roughly 8% in 2025. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales, particularly the impact of Apple Intelligence. Given the stock's current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and bearishness among analysts, the stock price movement post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies. Considering these factors, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to any potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector. Despite the initial market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout, with some industry leaders experiencing losses, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple (AAPL) that are poised to benefit from cost-effective AI models and increased industry spending seems positive. The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The recent news indicates that Apple Inc. reported a 4% increase in its stock price following the news of its iPhones being the best-selling smartphones in China last quarter. However, this positive news is tempered by the fact that Apple's market share in China has decreased compared to previous quarters, and analysts are reporting mixed sentiments, including concerns over pricing and potential overvaluation. The presence of analyst Dan Niles expressing that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive' raises caution, suggesting that longer-term fundamentals are under pressure. While there\u2019s short-term optimism due to recent sales figures, the overall trend appears to indicate a higher likelihood of resistance in sustaining price gains due to these longer-term declines in market share. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.55 for the price falling and 0.45 for the price rising based on the mixed signals from the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: This article presents a complex outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the negative side, Warren Buffett has significantly reduced his holdings, citing overvaluation and potential tax increases. The article highlights geopolitical and antitrust risks and cautious investor sentiment. GuruFocus\u2019s analysis points to a flat share price for the coming year, reinforcing this cautious outlook. However, it also notes positive factors, including the potential of new product releases and Apple's strategic vertical integration. Morgan Stanley projects revenue growth, indicating sustained demand and overall positive long-term metrics (GF score, Profitability Rank). \n\nConsidering Buffett's influence and the noted headwinds, the probability of a short-term fall is slightly increased compared with the other experts, although the long-term projections and general profitability mitigate this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, indicating Apple's stock surged as part of the 'Magnificent Seven'.  However, the article lacks specifics.  Previous predictions show a divergence of opinions, with some emphasizing negative factors like declining market share and overvaluation, while others highlight the positive headline and overall market strength. The range of predictions from different models (0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise) reflects the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock price movements based on limited information.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of concrete detail in the news, a balanced probability is warranted.  While the 'surge' suggests positive momentum, the absence of supporting details prevents assigning significantly higher probability to a price rise. The previous predictions, spanning a range of opinions, further reinforce the need for a cautious approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported revenues that exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%, and the stock has already risen 2% since the earnings report. Additionally, the broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the all-important Services segment missed revenue expectations, which could be a concern for investors. The overall reaction of consumer electronics stocks has been muted, with average share prices holding steady. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple's upcoming earnings report presents a mixed outlook. The stock has underperformed in 2025, down roughly 8%, and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. However, the expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year could be positive indicators. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales. The stock's performance post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies like Apple Intelligence. Given the current trends and expectations, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector. Despite the initial market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout, with some industry leaders experiencing losses, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple (AAPL) that are poised to benefit from cost-effective AI models and increased industry spending seems positive. The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the AI sector and the overall market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains. There are also references to broader technological trends involving AI and infrastructure which might positively influence investor confidence.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The recent news indicates a mix of positive and negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The announcement that iPhones are the best-selling smartphones in China is a positive development, especially in light of the company's earlier decline in market share. However, the overall trend shows declining market share in the longer term, with Apple's share declining from 20% in Q4 2023 to 15.6% in 2024. Analyst sentiments remain mixed, with concerns over overvaluation and competitive pressures contributing to a cautious outlook. The short-term optimism from the 4% stock rise today may not be enough to overcome the long-term challenges presented, leading to a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to these mixed and potentially negative sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This article presents a nuanced view of Apple's prospects for 2025. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and past performance, it highlights several headwinds. Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings, driven by overvaluation concerns and anticipated tax increases, is a major bearish signal. The article also points to geopolitical risks, antitrust issues, and the potential for weakened consumer spending. While new product releases and developments in AI offer some upside, the overall tone leans towards caution. The GuruFocus valuation suggests overvaluation. Looking at previous rounds, there's a mix of opinions, but a tendency towards a slightly negative outlook, likely influenced by negative signals from analysts. Considering all factors, the scale is slightly tilted towards downward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, highlighting Apple's surge as part of the 'Magnificent Seven'. However, the article itself provides limited detail.  Previous predictions show significant disagreement, with probabilities of a price rise ranging from 0.3 to 0.7.  This divergence suggests substantial uncertainty.  While the 'surge' is a positive signal, the lack of specific supporting information prevents assigning a decisively high probability to a price rise.  Negative factors mentioned in previous analyses include declining market share in China, concerns about overvaluation, and potential geopolitical risks.  Therefore, a balanced probability is most appropriate, reflecting the mixed signals and the limited information provided by the headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provides a retrospective analysis of Q3 earnings for consumer electronics stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's performance was mixed, with revenues slightly exceeding analysts' expectations but with a miss in the Services segment. Despite this, Apple's stock price increased by 2% post-earnings, indicating some investor confidence. The broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the muted reaction of consumer electronics stocks overall and the specific mixed results for Apple suggest cautious optimism rather than strong bullish sentiment. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a slight negative bias due to concerns over market share and valuation, while others highlight positive momentum. Given the mixed signals and the overall market context, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. The company's stock has underperformed in 2025, down roughly 8%, and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. However, expected earnings growth of 8% year-over-year and top-line growth of 3.7% year-over-year could be positive indicators. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales, particularly the impact of Apple Intelligence. The stock's performance post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies. Given the current trends and expectations, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive. Considering previous predictions, there is a general trend towards a cautious outlook, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise. Weighing the mixed signals and cautious sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector. Despite the initial market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout, with some industry leaders experiencing losses, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple (AAPL) that are poised to benefit from cost-effective AI models and increased industry spending seems positive. The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL. Considering the previous predictions and the mixed signals presented, I assign a higher probability to the stock price rising due to the positive long-term implications of the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. Additionally, there is optimistic commentary about the company's potential due to its involvement in various technological advancements, including AI and infrastructure developments. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. These short-term challenges, along with mentions of potential negative impacts on valuation and market dynamics, introduce uncertainties that may limit immediate gains. Combining the positive long-term outlook and recent market reactions gives a balanced perspective.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The recent news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates mixed signals. On the positive side, AAPL's stock surged 4% following its top position in smartphone sales in China last quarter. However, this is contrasted by the fact that their market share has declined over recent quarters, indicating potential long-term challenges. Analysts express mixed sentiments regarding the stock being overvalued and concerns over future growth, especially given declining market share from 20% to 15.6%. Therefore, while there is short-term optimism due to the sales figures, the overall negative trend raises the likelihood of the stock price falling more than rising. After synthesizing previous predictions and current sentiments, I estimate a slightly higher chance of a decrease in stock price versus an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: This news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL). Warren Buffett, a highly respected investor, has significantly reduced his stake, citing overvaluation and potential tax increases. While some argue this could be due to Buffett's aversion to tech or simply tax strategy, the mere action creates negative sentiment. The article mentions geopolitical risks, antitrust scrutiny, and potential weakness in consumer spending as further headwinds. While Apple is rolling out new products, guru focus predicts nearly a flat share price in the near term. Also, looking at how other predictions have evolved over the previous rounds, there has been a consistent negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price. \n\nAlthough the article does mention that the stock rose 30% in 2024, many are predicting a loss in momentum, further weighing down the stock. Therefore, a higher probability is given to the stock price falling\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, mentioning Apple's surge as part of the 'Magnificent Seven'. However, the article lacks specifics and the subsequent analysis reveals mixed signals. Previous predictions vary widely, reflecting considerable uncertainty.  Negative factors include declining market share in China, concerns about overvaluation, and potential geopolitical risks. Positive factors include the 'surge' itself and the generally positive market sentiment regarding the 'Magnificent Seven'.  Considering all factors, including the lack of concrete detail in the news and the range of opinions shown across different models, I tend towards a slightly lower probability of a price increase than a price decrease due to the predominance of negative indicators (market share decline, overvaluation, and potential unforeseen issues).  The weight of evidence suggests a marginally greater chance of a price drop in the short term, although the long-term prognosis remains somewhat positive given the industry's future.  Therefore I lean slightly towards the cautious predictions that have emerged from multiple prior analyses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported revenues that exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%, and the stock has already risen 2% since the earnings report. The broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the all-important Services segment missed revenue expectations, which could be a concern for investors. The overall reaction of consumer electronics stocks has been muted, with average share prices holding steady. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a slight negative bias due to concerns over market share and valuation, while others highlight positive momentum.

(AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. The company's stock has underperformed in 2025, down roughly 8%, and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. However, expected earnings growth of 8% year-over-year and top-line growth of 3.7% year-over-year could be positive indicators. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales, particularly the impact of Apple Intelligence. The stock's performance post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies. Considering previous predictions, there is a general trend towards a cautious outlook, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise. Weighing the mixed signals and cautious sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but still acknowledging significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector. Despite the initial market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout, with some industry leaders experiencing losses, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple (AAPL) that are poised to benefit from cost-effective AI models and increased industry spending seems positive. The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL. Considering the previous predictions and the mixed signals presented, I analyzed the trend of others' beliefs and the positive long-term implications of the news to estimate the probabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc.
