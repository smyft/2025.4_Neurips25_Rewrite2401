      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\nNews Content: Over 26% of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is invested in Apple stock, which he has owned since 2016 and is still his largest holding; however, he has sold over 615 million shares of Apple in the past four quarters.\n\nOvervalued and Tax Concerns\n\nApple has traditionally been a high-flying quality stock with a vast moat, an exemplary capital allocation strategy, and a tactical product rollout. Still, the stock has been heavily overvalued since late 2023, with a current value hovering around 20% over GuruFocus's calculated fair market value of $189.29. Furthermore, Buffett's nearly 25% share reduction during September was more likely due to tax considerations. During the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Buffett stated that he expected future tax rates to rise.\n\nTentative with Technology\n\nAnother reason for selling may be that Buffett is less comfortable with technology companies than his late partner, Charlie Munger, as Berkshire started offloading shares shortly after Charlie passed away in November 2023. Before his passing, Munger emphasized the importance of owning stocks like Apple and Alphabet, acknowledging their dominance and consistent outperformance in the market.\n\nDominos Investment\n\nBuffett's Apple sales have generated nearly $25 billion, giving Berkshire Hathaway a large cash pile for other investments. Fifty-five million of that cash has been invested in high-quality Domino's Pizza, representing approximately 3.7% of company shares. This solid-value, non-technology franchise business may appeal more to Buffett than his existing overinflated Apple stock. The stock is trading slightly below Guru Focus's fair market value estimate of $428.28, with an overall score of 92 and a profitability rank of 10 out of 10. Domino's share price is expected to rise approximately 10% in the next 12 months versus Apple's, which is predicted to increase by less than 1%. Domino's fortressing strategy, global master franchise agreements, Pulse POS system, and recently upgraded customer loyalty program have helped the company expand globally and drive domestic carryout traffic. The company is the prominent market leader in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) pizza business and outperformed Papa John's and Pizza Hut (owned by Yum Brands) in 2024. The company has an impressive 56% ROIC, contrasting sharply with a meager 9.95% WACC, suggesting the company is effectively allocating capital and accreting value despite a heavy debt burden.\n\nDomino's debt burden is reflected in the company's long history of negative debt-to-equity and equity-to-asset ratios. However, these metrics align with Papa John's and Yum Brands in this competitive, capital-intensive industry. With its huge cash pile, Berkshire Hathaway's interest in the company may help alleviate investor concerns. Domino's paid investors a $1.51 per share dividend in September and has had a 20% dividend growth rate over the last 10 years. That policy may be questionable, given their negative equity history.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nDPZ Data by GuruFocus\n\nHere's how Domino's metrics currently stack up with competitors (Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Domino's Pizza Inc Yum Brands Inc (Pizza Hut) Papa John's International Inc Symbol DPZ YUM PZZA Industry Restaurants Restaurants Restaurants GF Score 92 87 74 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Wide Narrow Predictability Rank 4/10 1/10 1/10 GF Value Rank 7/10 9/10 4/10 GF Valuation  Fairly Valued Modestly Undervalued Significantly Undervalued Profitability Rank 10/10 9/10 8/10 Financial Strength 4/10 4/10 4/10 Growth Rank 9/10 7/10 5/10 GF Value 429.80 144.33 79.35 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 443.84 0.00 0.00 Price Target 483.07 144.17 57.73 Revenue 4,665.47 7,223.00 2,099.94 PE Ratio 26.27 23.42 12.50 PEG Ratio 2.07 4.36 0.61 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 27.96 28.81 16.89 PB Ratio 0.00 0.00 0.00 PS Ratio 3.22 4.94 0.56 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 30.09 26.10 23.93 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 24.37 21.96 9.69 EV-to-EBITDA 20.00 18.28 8.91 Debt-to-Equity -1.31 -1.46 -2.23 Interest Coverage 4.41 4.74 3.11 Current Ratio 1.71 1.37 0.80 ROIC % 56.18 39.80 15.10 WACC % 10.06 7.66 7.66 Gross Margin % 39.05 48.57 20.25 Operating Margin % 18.49 32.19 6.58 Net Margin % 12.26 21.13 4.51 ROE % Negative Equity Negative Equity Negative Equity ROA % 32.99 24.31 11.02 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate 5.50 13.30 14.10 Dividends per Share (TTM)  5.74 2.62 1.84 Dividend Yield % 1.41 2.14 5.11 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.35 0.51 0.70 FCF Yield % 3.38 3.91 4.20 Buyback Yield % 1.85 0.93 0.00\n\nApple's Short and Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple's stock rose more than 30% in 2024 and is trading at all-time highs. Many fear the stock may lose momentum, as reflected in Guru Focus's flat share price target for the next 12 months. However, Apple investors might not want to unload their stock just yet.\n\nNear-term prospects are mixed due to geopolitical risks related to Apple's supply chain in China and Taiwan. With Trump's return to office, we might see a continuation of his previous trade policies, which previously have included tariffs on Chinese products and stricter enforcement of trade agreements.\n\nApple also has antitrust concerns. Since Google is the default search engine on Safari, Apple has taken an interest in the Department of Justice versus Google case, which may negatively impact Apple's ability to provide premium products to users. Weakened consumer spending may exacerbate these problems.\n\nHowever, the release of the new iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 holds some promise that the stock may maintain a similar 2024 trajectory, including record revenues of 9.4 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase, and a 12% earnings increase. Apple is also developing a proprietary cellular modem, expected to roll out in 2025, starting with the iPhone SE and even eventually moving to premium models by 2027. This vertical integration strategy is expected to drive margin expansion.\n\nWith the adoption of Apple Intelligence, Apple's latest artificial intelligence system, introduced at the company's tradeshow, Worldwide Developers Conference 2024, dedicated Apple users are expected to upgrade their current iPhone models in 2026. The company is also expected to have an 11.4% compounded annual growth rate in service revenue through fiscal year 2027. For these reasons, Morgan Stanley forecasts a 12.3% revenue growth and earnings per share of $8.52 for 2026.\n\nThe Stalwart Parent\n\nCautious investors can't go wrong with Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway shows moderate short-term gain potential with strong financial health and profitability metrics. Net margin, return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital indicate strong financial health compared to the S&P 500. The company had a record $325.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q3 2024, up from $276.9 billion at the end of June 2024. Berkshire Hathaway A and B shares are priced slightly above Guru Focus's calculated values. Investment income trends for the company remain strong due to increased bond reinvestment rates and Berkshire also exhibits attractive long-term prospects due to consistent revenue and net income growth, improved financial health, and a diversified business model. Berkshire Hathaway is expected to earn over $23.00 per share by 2027 through 2029 and may also continue to benefit from strategic acquisitions.\n\nHowever, there are a few cracks in the armor. Operating earnings were $4.68 per share in the third quarter of 2024, a decline due to decreased underwriting income from industrywide catastrophes. The company has a history of rising debt and inconsistent per-share cash flow within the last 5 years.What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nBRK.A Data by GuruFocus\n\nIn November 2024, CFRA downgraded its rating on Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares from 'Buy' to 'Hold,' attributing the decision to lower EPS estimates and revenue forecasts caused by widespread declines in operating revenues and insurance premiums.\n\nMorningstar lowered Berkshire Hathaway's moat rating from wide to narrow due to several factors. They observed signs of slippage in the railroad business and increased litigation exposure for the utilities/energy business, which have put downward pressure on excess returns for the noninsurance operations. Moreover, following Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s inevitable departure, the company will likely find it challenging to replicate the historic advantages he provided, making it harder for Berkshire to achieve superior returns consistently over the next decade.\n\nBelow is a comparison of significant metrics for the three main companies discussed in this report (BRK.A & BRK.B refer to the same company but have slightly different metrics due to market fluctuations; Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Apple Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Domino's Pizza Inc Symbol AAPL BRK.A BRK.B DPZ Industry Hardware Insurance Insurance Restaurants GF Score 96 72 69 92 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Narrow Narrow Wide Predictability Rank 5 Stars 1 Star 1 Star 4 Stars GF Value Rank 5/10 5/10 3/10 7/10 GF Valuation Modestly Overvalued Modestly Overvalued Significantly Overvalued Fairly Valued Profitability Rank 10/10 6/10 6/10 10/10 Financial Strength 6/10 7/10 7/10 4/10 Growth Rank 10/10 2/10 2/10 9/10 GF Value 189.76 564,060.75 353.49 429.80 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 144.50 0.00 0.00 443.84 Price Target 243.60 762,340.33 513.00 483.07 Revenue 391,035.00 452,954.00 452,954.00 4,665.47 PE Ratio 37.83 9.47 9.47 26.27 PEG Ratio 2.14 0.00 0.00 2.07 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 34.94 8.78 8.78 27.96 PB Ratio 61.05 1.61 1.61 0.00 PS Ratio 9.07 2.23 2.23 3.22 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 32.60 48.11 48.11 30.09 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 30.00 25.06 25.06 24.37 EV-to-EBITDA 25.99 7.28 7.28 20.00 Debt-to-Equity 1.87 0.20 0.20 -1.31 Interest Coverage N/A 27.47 27.47 4.41 Current Ratio 0.87 0.00 0.00 1.71 ROIC % 32.51 10.65 10.65 56.18 WACC %  11.41 9.07 9.07 10.06 Gross Margin % 46.21 0.00 0.00 39.05 Operating Margin % 31.51 0.00 0.00 18.49 Net Margin % 23.97 23.60 23.60 12.26 ROE %  140.28 18.50 18.50 Negative Equity ROA % 26.93 9.87 9.87 32.99 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate  3.00 25.10 25.10 5.50 Dividends per Share (TTM)  0.98 0.00 0.00 5.74 Dividend Yield % 0.43 0.00 0.00 1.41 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.15 0.00 0.00 0.35 FCF Yield % 3.15 2.08 2.08 3.38 Buyback Yield % 2.75 0.51 0.51 1.85\n\nGiven the current metrics of these three companies, Domino's appears to be the best value investment for those seeking a balance of growth potential and dividend yield. It is fairly valued with a significant expected price increase and offers a high dividend yield. Still, prospective investors should be wary of the company's high debt levels and negative equity.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is the clear winner for more risk-averse investors. The company has low PE and EV/EBITDA ratios and a nearly 70% margin of safety based on GuruFocus's discounted cash flow model. Still, these calculations may be highly unpredictable due to the company's narrowing moat, challenges in capital allocation, and inevitable leadership transition.\n\nTake-Aways\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway significantly reduced its Apple holdings, selling over 615 million shares due to concerns about Apple's overvaluation and future tax rates. This shift reflects Buffett's cautious stance on technology stocks following the passing of his partner, Charlie Munger.\n\nThe proceeds from these sales have been partially reinvested in Domino's Pizza, a high-quality, non-technology franchise that aligns more closely with Buffett's investment philosophy.\n\nDespite Apple's strong performance and promising product rollouts, its overvaluation and geopolitical risks present challenges. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway faces headwinds such as decreased underwriting income, rising debt, and a narrowing moat, compounded by the impending leadership transition post-Buffett. Domino's Pizza emerges as a compelling value investment, offering a balance of growth potential and dividend yield despite its high debt levels.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Despite the positive news regarding Apple's iPhones being the best-selling smartphone in China for Q4, there are concerning trends in market share compared to previous quarters. The decline in market share from Q4 2023 to 2024 suggests a weakening position. Furthermore, earlier reports indicated that Apple had dropped to third place in market share. While the recent stock price increase may indicate some short-term optimism, the overall context of declining market presence and the commentary on Apple's stock being perceived as 'pretty expensive' by Dan Niles may temper bullish sentiment. Therefore, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative long-term trends outweighing the positive aspects of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While strong performance and new product releases are positives, concerns about overvaluation, geopolitical risks (China/Taiwan, potential trade wars), and anti-trust issues create headwinds. Buffett's sale of Apple shares, though potentially tax-related, also introduces uncertainty. The article suggests a flat share price target for the next 12 months from GuruFocus. Considering both positive and negative potential impacts equally using the available information, it's reasonable to provide a 50-50 weighting to both probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple stock ('AAPL') surged as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group.  This is positive news and suggests recent strong performance. However, the headline is relatively vague and doesn't provide specific details about the reasons for the surge or the magnitude of the price movement. The lack of specifics makes assigning precise probabilities difficult.  I am assigning a higher probability to a price rise given the headline's positive tone, but acknowledging that the information is insufficient to be highly confident.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a retrospective analysis of Q3 earnings for consumer electronics stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's performance was mixed, with revenues slightly exceeding analysts' expectations but with a miss in the Services segment. Despite this, Apple's stock price increased by 2% post-earnings, indicating some investor confidence. The broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the muted reaction of consumer electronics stocks overall and the specific mixed results for Apple suggest cautious optimism rather than strong bullish sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its quarterly earnings, and the stock has been underperforming, down roughly 8% in 2025. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales, particularly the impact of Apple Intelligence. Given the stock's current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and bearishness among analysts, the stock price movement post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies. Considering these factors, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to any potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector. Despite the initial market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout, with some industry leaders experiencing losses, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple (AAPL) that are poised to benefit from cost-effective AI models and increased industry spending seems positive. The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The recent news indicates that Apple Inc. reported a 4% increase in its stock price following the news of its iPhones being the best-selling smartphones in China last quarter. However, this positive news is tempered by the fact that Apple's market share in China has decreased compared to previous quarters, and analysts are reporting mixed sentiments, including concerns over pricing and potential overvaluation. The presence of analyst Dan Niles expressing that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive' raises caution, suggesting that longer-term fundamentals are under pressure. While there\u2019s short-term optimism due to recent sales figures, the overall trend appears to indicate a higher likelihood of resistance in sustaining price gains due to these longer-term declines in market share. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.55 for the price falling and 0.45 for the price rising based on the mixed signals from the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: This article presents a complex outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the negative side, Warren Buffett has significantly reduced his holdings, citing overvaluation and potential tax increases. The article highlights geopolitical and antitrust risks and cautious investor sentiment. GuruFocus\u2019s analysis points to a flat share price for the coming year, reinforcing this cautious outlook. However, it also notes positive factors, including the potential of new product releases and Apple's strategic vertical integration. Morgan Stanley projects revenue growth, indicating sustained demand and overall positive long-term metrics (GF score, Profitability Rank). \n\nConsidering Buffett's influence and the noted headwinds, the probability of a short-term fall is slightly increased compared with the other experts, although the long-term projections and general profitability mitigate this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, indicating Apple's stock surged as part of the 'Magnificent Seven'.  However, the article lacks specifics.  Previous predictions show a divergence of opinions, with some emphasizing negative factors like declining market share and overvaluation, while others highlight the positive headline and overall market strength. The range of predictions from different models (0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise) reflects the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock price movements based on limited information.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of concrete detail in the news, a balanced probability is warranted.  While the 'surge' suggests positive momentum, the absence of supporting details prevents assigning significantly higher probability to a price rise. The previous predictions, spanning a range of opinions, further reinforce the need for a cautious approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported revenues that exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%, and the stock has already risen 2% since the earnings report. Additionally, the broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the all-important Services segment missed revenue expectations, which could be a concern for investors. The overall reaction of consumer electronics stocks has been muted, with average share prices holding steady. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple's upcoming earnings report presents a mixed outlook. The stock has underperformed in 2025, down roughly 8%, and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. However, the expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year could be positive indicators. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales. The stock's performance post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies like Apple Intelligence. Given the current trends and expectations, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector.

The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the AI sector and the overall market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains. There are also references to broader technological trends involving AI and infrastructure which might positively influence investor confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
