(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Despite the positive news regarding Apple's iPhones being the best-selling smartphone in China for Q4, there are concerning trends in market share compared to previous quarters. The decline in market share from Q4 2023 to 2024 suggests a weakening position. Furthermore, earlier reports indicated that Apple had dropped to third place in market share. While the recent stock price increase may indicate some short-term optimism, the overall context of declining market presence and the commentary on Apple's stock being perceived as 'pretty expensive' by Dan Niles may temper bullish sentiment. Therefore, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative long-term trends outweighing the positive aspects of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While strong performance and new product releases are positives, concerns about overvaluation, geopolitical risks (China/Taiwan, potential trade wars), and anti-trust issues create headwinds. Buffett's sale of Apple shares, though potentially tax-related, also introduces uncertainty. The article suggests a flat share price target for the next 12 months from GuruFocus. Considering both positive and negative potential impacts equally using the available information, it's reasonable to provide a 50-50 weighting to both probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple stock ('AAPL') surged as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group.  This is positive news and suggests recent strong performance. However, the headline is relatively vague and doesn't provide specific details about the reasons for the surge or the magnitude of the price movement. The lack of specifics makes assigning precise probabilities difficult.  I am assigning a higher probability to a price rise given the headline's positive tone, but acknowledging that the information is insufficient to be highly confident.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a retrospective analysis of Q3 earnings for consumer electronics stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's performance was mixed, with revenues slightly exceeding analysts' expectations but with a miss in the Services segment. Despite this, Apple's stock price increased by 2% post-earnings, indicating some investor confidence. The broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the muted reaction of consumer electronics stocks overall and the specific mixed results for Apple suggest cautious optimism rather than strong bullish sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its quarterly earnings, and the stock has been underperforming, down roughly 8% in 2025. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales, particularly the impact of Apple Intelligence. Given the stock's current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and bearishness among analysts, the stock price movement post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies. Considering these factors, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to any potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector. Despite the initial market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout, with some industry leaders experiencing losses, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple (AAPL) that are poised to benefit from cost-effective AI models and increased industry spending seems positive. The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The recent news indicates that Apple Inc. reported a 4% increase in its stock price following the news of its iPhones being the best-selling smartphones in China last quarter. However, this positive news is tempered by the fact that Apple's market share in China has decreased compared to previous quarters, and analysts are reporting mixed sentiments, including concerns over pricing and potential overvaluation. The presence of analyst Dan Niles expressing that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive' raises caution, suggesting that longer-term fundamentals are under pressure. While there\u2019s short-term optimism due to recent sales figures, the overall trend appears to indicate a higher likelihood of resistance in sustaining price gains due to these longer-term declines in market share. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.55 for the price falling and 0.45 for the price rising based on the mixed signals from the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: This article presents a complex outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the negative side, Warren Buffett has significantly reduced his holdings, citing overvaluation and potential tax increases. The article highlights geopolitical and antitrust risks and cautious investor sentiment. GuruFocus\u2019s analysis points to a flat share price for the coming year, reinforcing this cautious outlook. However, it also notes positive factors, including the potential of new product releases and Apple's strategic vertical integration. Morgan Stanley projects revenue growth, indicating sustained demand and overall positive long-term metrics (GF score, Profitability Rank). \n\nConsidering Buffett's influence and the noted headwinds, the probability of a short-term fall is slightly increased compared with the other experts, although the long-term projections and general profitability mitigate this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, indicating Apple's stock surged as part of the 'Magnificent Seven'.  However, the article lacks specifics.  Previous predictions show a divergence of opinions, with some emphasizing negative factors like declining market share and overvaluation, while others highlight the positive headline and overall market strength. The range of predictions from different models (0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise) reflects the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock price movements based on limited information.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of concrete detail in the news, a balanced probability is warranted.  While the 'surge' suggests positive momentum, the absence of supporting details prevents assigning significantly higher probability to a price rise. The previous predictions, spanning a range of opinions, further reinforce the need for a cautious approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported revenues that exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%, and the stock has already risen 2% since the earnings report. Additionally, the broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the all-important Services segment missed revenue expectations, which could be a concern for investors. The overall reaction of consumer electronics stocks has been muted, with average share prices holding steady. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple's upcoming earnings report presents a mixed outlook. The stock has underperformed in 2025, down roughly 8%, and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. However, the expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year could be positive indicators. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales. The stock's performance post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies like Apple Intelligence. Given the current trends and expectations, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector. Despite the initial market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout, with some industry leaders experiencing losses, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple (AAPL) that are poised to benefit from cost-effective AI models and increased industry spending seems positive. The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the AI sector and the overall market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.
