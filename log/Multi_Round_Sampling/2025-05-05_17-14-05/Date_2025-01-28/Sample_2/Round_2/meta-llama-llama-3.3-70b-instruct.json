(AAPL)\nNews Headline: OpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov as industry reels from DeepSeek's breakout\nNews Content: OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project.

Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Despite the positive news regarding Apple's iPhones being the best-selling smartphone in China for Q4, there are concerning trends in market share compared to previous quarters. The decline in market share from Q4 2023 to 2024 suggests a weakening position. Furthermore, earlier reports indicated that Apple had dropped to third place in market share. While the recent stock price increase may indicate some short-term optimism, the overall context of declining market presence and the commentary on Apple's stock being perceived as 'pretty expensive' by Dan Niles may temper bullish sentiment. Therefore, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative long-term trends outweighing the positive aspects of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While strong performance and new product releases are positives, concerns about overvaluation, geopolitical risks (China/Taiwan, potential trade wars), and anti-trust issues create headwinds. Buffett's sale of Apple shares, though potentially tax-related, also introduces uncertainty. The article suggests a flat share price target for the next 12 months from GuruFocus. Considering both positive and negative potential impacts equally using the available information, it's reasonable to provide a 50-50 weighting to both probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple stock ('AAPL') surged as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group.  This is positive news and suggests recent strong performance. However, the headline is relatively vague and doesn't provide specific details about the reasons for the surge or the magnitude of the price movement. The lack of specifics makes assigning precise probabilities difficult.  I am assigning a higher probability to a price rise given the headline's positive tone, but acknowledging that the information is insufficient to be highly confident.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a retrospective analysis of Q3 earnings for consumer electronics stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's performance was mixed, with revenues slightly exceeding analysts' expectations but with a miss in the Services segment. Despite this, Apple's stock price increased by 2% post-earnings, indicating some investor confidence. The broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the muted reaction of consumer electronics stocks overall and the specific mixed results for Apple suggest cautious optimism rather than strong bullish sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its quarterly earnings, and the stock has been underperforming, down roughly 8% in 2025. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales, particularly the impact of Apple Intelligence. Given the stock's current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and bearishness among analysts, the stock price movement post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies. Considering these factors, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to any potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector. Despite the initial market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout, with some industry leaders experiencing losses, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple (AAPL) that are poised to benefit from cost-effective AI models and increased industry spending seems positive. The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The recent news indicates that Apple Inc. reported a 4% increase in its stock price following the news of its iPhones being the best-selling smartphones in China last quarter. However, this positive news is tempered by the fact that Apple's market share in China has decreased compared to previous quarters, and analysts are reporting mixed sentiments, including concerns over pricing and potential overvaluation. The presence of analyst Dan Niles expressing that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive' raises caution, suggesting that longer-term fundamentals are under pressure. While there\u2019s short-term optimism due to recent sales figures, the overall trend appears to indicate a higher likelihood of resistance in sustaining price gains due to these longer-term declines in market share. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.55 for the price falling and 0.45 for the price rising based on the mixed signals from the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: This article presents a complex outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the negative side, Warren Buffett has significantly reduced his holdings, citing overvaluation and potential tax increases. The article highlights geopolitical and antitrust risks and cautious investor sentiment. GuruFocus\u2019s analysis points to a flat share price for the coming year, reinforcing this cautious outlook. However, it also notes positive factors, including the potential of new product releases and Apple's strategic vertical integration. Morgan Stanley projects revenue growth, indicating sustained demand and overall positive long-term metrics (GF score, Profitability Rank). \n\nConsidering Buffett's influence and the noted headwinds, the probability of a short-term fall is slightly increased compared with the other experts, although the long-term projections and general profitability mitigate this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, indicating Apple's stock surged as part of the 'Magnificent Seven'.  However, the article lacks specifics.  Previous predictions show a divergence of opinions, with some emphasizing negative factors like declining market share and overvaluation, while others highlight the positive headline and overall market strength. The range of predictions from different models (0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise) reflects the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock price movements based on limited information.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of concrete detail in the news, a balanced probability is warranted.  While the 'surge' suggests positive momentum, the absence of supporting details prevents assigning significantly higher probability to a price rise. The previous predictions, spanning a range of opinions, further reinforce the need for a cautious approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported revenues that exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%, and the stock has already risen 2% since the earnings report. Additionally, the broader market context, including rate cuts and a strong stock market performance in 2024, suggests a generally positive environment. However, the all-important Services segment missed revenue expectations, which could be a concern for investors. The overall reaction of consumer electronics stocks has been muted, with average share prices holding steady. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple's upcoming earnings report presents a mixed outlook. The stock has underperformed in 2025, down roughly 8%, and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. However, the expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year could be positive indicators. Key metrics to watch include Apple's performance in China, Services results, and iPhone sales. The stock's performance post-earnings will likely be dictated by guidance and adoption rates of new technologies like Apple Intelligence. Given the current trends and expectations, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to potential disappointment in earnings or guidance, but there's still a significant chance for a rise if the results and outlook are positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI launching ChatGPT Gov and the announcement of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI initiative, suggests increased investment and innovation in the AI sector.

The fact that Apple gained ground during the initial sell-off, along with Meta, indicates market confidence in these companies' abilities to adapt and benefit from the evolving AI landscape. President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition and the potential for heightened innovation due to increased competition also support a positive outlook for AAPL. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the AI sector and the overall market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit immediate gains. There are also references to broader technological trends involving AI and infrastructure which might positively influence investor confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
