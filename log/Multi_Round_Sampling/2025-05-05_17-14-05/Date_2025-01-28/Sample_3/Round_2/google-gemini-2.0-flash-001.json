(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Where the UK\u2019s ISA millionaires are investing\nNews Content: The number of investors with \u00a31 million or more in their stocks and shares individual savings account (ISA) is on the rise, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's (HL.L) platform data, which revealed where they are putting their money.\n\nThe UK's biggest investment platform said there were 1,322 \"ISA millionaires\" on its platform as of the end of December.\n\nThe figure was up 14% over the previous six months alone and was much higher when compared to the 168 ISA millionaires on the platform seven years ago, with just three recorded in 2012.\n\nHL found that the average age of an ISA millionaire on its platform was now 72 years old, down from 74 six months ago. However, the gender split of ISA millionaires had not changed from two years ago, with just over two-thirds found to be men.\n\n\"Some people get into investment in the hope of getting rich quick, but the vast majority of ISA millionaires have built a fortune through the far more reliable approach of getting rich slow,\" said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at HL.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\n\"They don\u2019t necessarily take enormous risks: many consistently invest as much as possible of their annual allowance, in a diverse and balanced portfolio, every year, for decades.\"\n\nMarshall pointed out that the top 10 stocks bought by this group were dominated by UK-listed blue-chip companies, including those that have traditionally paid strong dividends.\n\n\"It means most of them aren\u2019t speculating,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not in a hurry to trade them regularly either as, while most ISA millionaires traded in 2024, this has tended to be infrequent.\"\n\nAs for the most bought funds, Marshall said ISA millionaires were investing in a broad international mix of popular funds. Half of these funds were focused on a diversified mix of global companies, though there were also a couple of UK funds on the list, including an income fund.\n\n\"This reflects that as investors get older, some of the portfolio may have been reconfigured for income,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a larger portfolio, you have more scope to add specialist funds into the mix, which is why we see a technology and India fund in the list of popular investments. Investors with a larger portfolio may be willing to take more risks, partly as they may have more scope for loss, or have sufficient stores of value elsewhere, such as cash ISAs, savings accounts, or annuities.\"\n\nHere's more detail on which were the most popular stocks and funds with HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLegal & General Group (LGEN.L)\n\nFinancial services company Legal & General Group was one name on the list, despite its shares trading nearly 8% in the red on a one-year basis.\n\nIn December, the firm said it was planning to return capital to investors and was on track to meet financial targets. L&G said it was on track to deliver mid-single digital growth in operating profit for the 2024 fiscal year, in line with guidance\n\nOperating profit in its half-year results came in at \u00a3920m ($1.14bn), slightly below the \u00a3924m it delivered in the first half of 2023. Profit after tax attributable to shareholders was down 41% to \u00a3223m.\n\nHowever, L&G raised its half-year dividend by 5% to 6p per share. The company's full-year results are due out on 12 March.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(LGEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nAnother big name on the list was BP, though shares in the oil major are down nearly 10% on a one-year basis.\n\nIn October, BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The oil major reported a nearly 30% slump in underlying replacement cost profit to $2.3bn (\u00a31.85bn) in the third quarter. Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric BP uses as its version of net income.\n\nBP attributed the fall in net income in the third quarter to factors such as weaker realised refining margins and a poor oil trading result.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite worse quarterly results, BP announced a share buyback of $1.75bn as part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that is still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\n\nOil prices have been under pressure over concerns about weaker demand and geopolitical tensions, which has pushed brent crude (BZ=F) back below $78 per barrel.\n\nBP's fourth quarter results and its latest dividend announcement are due out on 11 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(BP.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMiner Rio Tinto also made HL's list of the most-bought stocks by ISA millionaires. While the stock is down nearly 12% over the past year, it recently ticked up slightly on reports that it had been in talks with Glencore (GLEN.L) about a potential merger, though discussions were said to no longer be active.\n\nIn its recently released fourth quarter production results, Rio Tinto said its mined copper production was up 13% in 2024 on the previous year.\n\nCEO Jakob Stausholm said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that US president Donald Trump will give the green light to the company's copper mine in Arizona.\n\n\"I do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he said. It comes after a long battle over permits for the mine.\n\nThe Resolution mine would be the biggest copper mine in North America once completed, capable of producing as much as 25% of US copper demand each year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(RIO.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nISA millionaire top funds\n\nFive Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) index funds were among those most bought by HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nThis included the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P000023MW.L), which tracks the performance of the FTSE World \u2013 Technology index.\n\nThe \u00a33.8bn fund is up nearly 38% over the past year, with its top holdings including iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAnother popular fund with ISA millionaires was Jupiter India (0P0000U20R.L), which has delivered a return of 24% over one year. This return was ahead of its target benchmark of the 13% return from the MSCI India index with net dividends re-invested.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nThe biggest sectors the fund is allocated to are financials and healthcare. Its biggest holdings include tobacco manufacturer Godfrey Phillips India (GODFRYPHLP.NS) and private hospital network Fortis Healthcare (FORTIS.NS).\n\nArtemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L), which invests in UK companies, was also named on HL's list. The fund has produced a return of 15% over one year, beating the FTSE All-Share's (0P00000CNT.L) 9.5%.\n\nFinancials also make up the biggest share of sector exposure in this fund, followed by consumer discretionary and staples firms.\n\nTop holdings include Pearson (PSON.L), which provides educational materials and technology, along with private equity investment trust 3i Group (III.L).\n\nRead more:\n\n6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency Five ways to save on the cost of having children\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other Magnificent Seven stocks in 2024, indicating strong investor interest and possibly favorable market conditions. Given that Apple has shown solid gains alongside its peers, it is likely that this trend will continue, creating a higher probability of stock price rise. However, market conditions can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk of a price adjustment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment behavior of UK ISA millionaires and their preferences for blue-chip stocks and popular funds. While the article does mention that Apple (AAPL) is a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust fund, this is a relatively indirect reference. The news does not directly impact Apple's fundamentals. ISA millionaires' preference for stable, dividend-paying stocks suggests they seek lower-risk investments. The fund itself has performed well (up nearly 38%), indicating that indirectly holding the share is beneficial to an older, wealthier profile with high risk tolerance and disposable funds. While there is no explicit negative information about Apple, the article doesn't provide strong catalysts for a significant price increase. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability of a price rise but acknowledge the limited direct impact of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success has caused a broad sell-off in tech stocks, impacting companies heavily involved in AI development like Nvidia, Apple's direct involvement is less pronounced.  The news focuses on the impact on AI-related spending and the potential for slower adoption of high-performance computing, which could affect companies like Nvidia more significantly. Apple's upcoming earnings report will be crucial, as investors seek clarity on the company's own AI investments and potential impact from the DeepSeek model.  The fact that DeepSeek's app became a top download on the Apple App Store is a positive, albeit indirectly related factor, showing continued strength in Apple's ecosystem.  However, the general negative market sentiment and concerns about AI spending could still negatively influence Apple's stock price, at least in the short term. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the difference isn't drastic considering the indirect nature of the news's impact on Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending. BofA analysts cite several factors that could drive Apple's stock higher, including its defensive nature, potential benefits from edge AI, upcoming product launches (iPhone SE, iPhone 17), insourcing of modem production, and the WWDC in June featuring AI-driven use cases. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given the bullish analyst sentiment, the defensive appeal, and multiple growth catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue, but its stock trades at an above-average valuation. This implies that while the company's financial performance is strong, its stock price may be overvalued. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of it falling is higher due to potential correction from overvaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the positive performance of Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in 2024, suggesting strong investor interest and favorable market conditions. Despite some mixed predictions, the overall sentiment towards Apple is optimistic due to its solid gains and influence on major indexes like the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500. Analysts mention growth catalysts such as new product launches and defensive characteristics which could drive stock prices higher. There are also concerns related to market sell-offs and AI spending that could create short-term volatility. However, the positive context of maintaining strong revenue and market position suggests a higher likelihood for stock price appreciation. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires. While Apple is mentioned as a top holding within a specific Legal & General fund (Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust) favored by these investors, this is an indirect indicator. The overall investment strategy of this group leans towards blue-chip companies and established funds, suggesting a risk-averse approach. The article doesn't convey any specific negative factors concerning Apple; it may marginally support a stable outlook due to the fund's past performance. Considering differing expert views in previous rounds and potential instability, I estimate slight stability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success caused a broad tech sell-off, impacting AI-focused companies like Nvidia more directly,  Apple's involvement is less pronounced.  The concern is the potential impact on AI spending and slower high-performance computing adoption, which could indirectly affect companies like Apple. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is crucial. The DeepSeek app's success on the Apple App Store is a positive sign, highlighting Apple's ecosystem strength. The overall market sentiment is negative, but the previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering the indirect impact of the news, the overall probability of a price rise is slightly lower than a fall, considering the general negative sentiment and uncertainty around future AI spending.  The previous predictions show significant diversity of opinion, adding further complexity to the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending.

Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given the bullish analyst sentiment, the defensive appeal, and multiple growth catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall in the near term. The previous predictions also show a trend of higher probability for price rise, especially from models that focused on the positive aspects of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue, but its stock trades at an above-average valuation. This implies that while the company's financial performance is strong, its stock price may be overvalued. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a price rise due to positive performance and defensive nature, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to potential correction from overvaluation. However, the overall trend of the predictions suggests that the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without having to invest heavily in large language models or infrastructure, according to Baird analysts. Despite the emergence of a competitive AI model by DeepSeek, analysts suggest that Apple's competitive position remains strong. While there is some concern about market sentiment regarding AI spending, Apple appears less exposed and has the potential to capitalize on AI through its consumer products. Additionally, historical trends show strong performance for Apple, further supporting the positive outlook. The various predictions provided suggest mixed signals, but overall, the bullish signals from analysts outweigh the concerns, indicating a higher probability of stock price rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
