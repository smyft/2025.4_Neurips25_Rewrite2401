(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other Magnificent Seven stocks in 2024, indicating strong investor interest and possibly favorable market conditions. Given that Apple has shown solid gains alongside its peers, it is likely that this trend will continue, creating a higher probability of stock price rise. However, market conditions can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk of a price adjustment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment behavior of UK ISA millionaires and their preferences for blue-chip stocks and popular funds. While the article does mention that Apple (AAPL) is a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust fund, this is a relatively indirect reference. The news does not directly impact Apple's fundamentals. ISA millionaires' preference for stable, dividend-paying stocks suggests they seek lower-risk investments. The fund itself has performed well (up nearly 38%), indicating that indirectly holding the share is beneficial to an older, wealthier profile with high risk tolerance and disposable funds. While there is no explicit negative information about Apple, the article doesn't provide strong catalysts for a significant price increase. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability of a price rise but acknowledge the limited direct impact of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success has caused a broad sell-off in tech stocks, impacting companies heavily involved in AI development like Nvidia, Apple's direct involvement is less pronounced.  The news focuses on the impact on AI-related spending and the potential for slower adoption of high-performance computing, which could affect companies like Nvidia more significantly. Apple's upcoming earnings report will be crucial, as investors seek clarity on the company's own AI investments and potential impact from the DeepSeek model.  The fact that DeepSeek's app became a top download on the Apple App Store is a positive, albeit indirectly related factor, showing continued strength in Apple's ecosystem.  However, the general negative market sentiment and concerns about AI spending could still negatively influence Apple's stock price, at least in the short term. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the difference isn't drastic considering the indirect nature of the news's impact on Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending. BofA analysts cite several factors that could drive Apple's stock higher, including its defensive nature, potential benefits from edge AI, upcoming product launches (iPhone SE, iPhone 17), insourcing of modem production, and the WWDC in June featuring AI-driven use cases. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given the bullish analyst sentiment, the defensive appeal, and multiple growth catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue, but its stock trades at an above-average valuation. This implies that while the company's financial performance is strong, its stock price may be overvalued. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of it falling is higher due to potential correction from overvaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
