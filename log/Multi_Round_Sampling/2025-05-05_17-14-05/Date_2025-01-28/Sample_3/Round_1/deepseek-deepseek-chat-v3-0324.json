(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\nNews Content: Investing.com -- The stock market suffered a sharp sell-off Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.46% and the Nasdaq falling 3% after Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough sparked concerns over lower AI-related spending.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America believe that the pullback created idiosyncratic buy opportunities in certain stocks. They highlighted Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), noting that \u201ceach name has compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/datacenter spending.\u201d\n\nBofA also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), citing their defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility.\n\nApple is one of the rare technology stocks that rose higher on Monday.\n\n\u201cOn a day when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, Apple shares were up 3% as investors realize the potential for edge AI and there is a flight to safety driven by Apple\u2019s earnings resiliency,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan noted.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is truly able to lower the cost of AI inferencing and better models are developed faster and cheaper, then edge AI applications and Apple as the edge device maker, stands to benefit. We view Apple as the ultimate play on having an LLM in your pocket,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA analysts believe several key drivers could drive upside in the tech giant\u2019s shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE in March or April, insourcing of modem production to improve gross margins, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025.\n\nFor IBM, BofA highlighted catalysts including a new mainframe cycle, acceleration in its Software (ETR:SOWGn) division, and mergers and acquisitions activity. Analysts project higher growth in Software for the next three years, driven by Enterprise AI opportunities and the launch of a new Mainframe (z17) in 2025.\n\n\u201cFor IBM, AI represents an opportunity in its Consulting business as it seeks to position itself as the go-to partner of choice for AI consulting.\n\nCorning's stock fell by 8.7% on Monday, but BofA analysts point out multiple key drivers that could foster recovery and growth. These include the cyclical recovery in its Optical business, the Lumen/Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program ramps, opportunities in the Solar sector, consistent profitability in the Display segment, and its upcoming Investor Day on March 18.\n\nFor HPE, which saw its shares sink 5.8%, the firm points to the Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) acquisition and cost reduction initiatives as factors that could improve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAI server exposure is not embedded in the valuation multiple,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan added.\n\nBofA also sees a significant value unlock for Western Digital with its anticipated spin-off, estimating value creation between $5-10 billion. The firm also references the SanDisk Analyst Day (February 11) and Western Digital Analyst Day (February 12) as key catalysts. The company\u2019s stock lost 4.5% Monday.\n\nSeagate also saw a pullback, but BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing improvements in the HDD industry structure since the last downturn.\n\nThe company's focus on ramping up Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology, increasing gross margins through a higher mix of high-capacity/HAMR drives, and continued data center spending (excluding AI) are seen as primary growth drivers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\n\nMorgan Stanley cuts Nvidia stock target after DeepSeek release\n\nUS stock futures edge higher; Fed meeting, tech sector in focus\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other Magnificent Seven stocks in 2024, indicating strong investor interest and possibly favorable market conditions. Given that Apple has shown solid gains alongside its peers, it is likely that this trend will continue, creating a higher probability of stock price rise. However, market conditions can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk of a price adjustment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment behavior of UK ISA millionaires and their preferences for blue-chip stocks and popular funds. While the article does mention that Apple (AAPL) is a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust fund, this is a relatively indirect reference. The news does not directly impact Apple's fundamentals. ISA millionaires' preference for stable, dividend-paying stocks suggests they seek lower-risk investments. The fund itself has performed well (up nearly 38%), indicating that indirectly holding the share is beneficial to an older, wealthier profile with high risk tolerance and disposable funds. While there is no explicit negative information about Apple, the article doesn't provide strong catalysts for a significant price increase. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability of a price rise but acknowledge the limited direct impact of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success has caused a broad sell-off in tech stocks, impacting companies heavily involved in AI development like Nvidia, Apple's direct involvement is less pronounced.  The news focuses on the impact on AI-related spending and the potential for slower adoption of high-performance computing, which could affect companies like Nvidia more significantly. Apple's upcoming earnings report will be crucial, as investors seek clarity on the company's own AI investments and potential impact from the DeepSeek model.  The fact that DeepSeek's app became a top download on the Apple App Store is a positive, albeit indirectly related factor, showing continued strength in Apple's ecosystem.  However, the general negative market sentiment and concerns about AI spending could still negatively influence Apple's stock price, at least in the short term. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the difference isn't drastic considering the indirect nature of the news's impact on Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending. BofA analysts cite several factors that could drive Apple's stock higher, including its defensive nature, potential benefits from edge AI, upcoming product launches (iPhone SE, iPhone 17), insourcing of modem production, and the WWDC in June featuring AI-driven use cases. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given the bullish analyst sentiment, the defensive appeal, and multiple growth catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue, but its stock trades at an above-average valuation. This implies that while the company's financial performance is strong, its stock price may be overvalued. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of it falling is higher due to potential correction from overvaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
