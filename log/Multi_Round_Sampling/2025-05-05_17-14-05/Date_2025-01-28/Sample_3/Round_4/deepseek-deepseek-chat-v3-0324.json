(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\nNews Content: Investing.com -- The stock market suffered a sharp sell-off Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.46% and the Nasdaq falling 3% after Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough sparked concerns over lower AI-related spending.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America believe that the pullback created idiosyncratic buy opportunities in certain stocks. They highlighted Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), noting that \u201ceach name has compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/datacenter spending.\u201d\n\nBofA also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), citing their defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility.\n\nApple is one of the rare technology stocks that rose higher on Monday.\n\n\u201cOn a day when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, Apple shares were up 3% as investors realize the potential for edge AI and there is a flight to safety driven by Apple\u2019s earnings resiliency,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan noted.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is truly able to lower the cost of AI inferencing and better models are developed faster and cheaper, then edge AI applications and Apple as the edge device maker, stands to benefit. We view Apple as the ultimate play on having an LLM in your pocket,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA analysts believe several key drivers could drive upside in the tech giant\u2019s shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE in March or April, insourcing of modem production to improve gross margins, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025.\n\nFor IBM, BofA highlighted catalysts including a new mainframe cycle, acceleration in its Software (ETR:SOWGn) division, and mergers and acquisitions activity. Analysts project higher growth in Software for the next three years, driven by Enterprise AI opportunities and the launch of a new Mainframe (z17) in 2025.\n\n\u201cFor IBM, AI represents an opportunity in its Consulting business as it seeks to position itself as the go-to partner of choice for AI consulting.\n\nCorning's stock fell by 8.7% on Monday, but BofA analysts point out multiple key drivers that could foster recovery and growth. These include the cyclical recovery in its Optical business, the Lumen/Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program ramps, opportunities in the Solar sector, consistent profitability in the Display segment, and its upcoming Investor Day on March 18.\n\nFor HPE, which saw its shares sink 5.8%, the firm points to the Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) acquisition and cost reduction initiatives as factors that could improve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAI server exposure is not embedded in the valuation multiple,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan added.\n\nBofA also sees a significant value unlock for Western Digital with its anticipated spin-off, estimating value creation between $5-10 billion. The firm also references the SanDisk Analyst Day (February 11) and Western Digital Analyst Day (February 12) as key catalysts. The company\u2019s stock lost 4.5% Monday.\n\nSeagate also saw a pullback, but BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing improvements in the HDD industry structure since the last downturn.\n\nThe company's focus on ramping up Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology, increasing gross margins through a higher mix of high-capacity/HAMR drives, and continued data center spending (excluding AI) are seen as primary growth drivers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\n\nMorgan Stanley cuts Nvidia stock target after DeepSeek release\n\nUS stock futures edge higher; Fed meeting, tech sector in focus\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other Magnificent Seven stocks in 2024, indicating strong investor interest and possibly favorable market conditions. Given that Apple has shown solid gains alongside its peers, it is likely that this trend will continue, creating a higher probability of stock price rise. However, market conditions can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk of a price adjustment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment behavior of UK ISA millionaires and their preferences for blue-chip stocks and popular funds. While the article does mention that Apple (AAPL) is a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust fund, this is a relatively indirect reference. The news does not directly impact Apple's fundamentals. ISA millionaires' preference for stable, dividend-paying stocks suggests they seek lower-risk investments. The fund itself has performed well (up nearly 38%), indicating that indirectly holding the share is beneficial to an older, wealthier profile with high risk tolerance and disposable funds. While there is no explicit negative information about Apple, the article doesn't provide strong catalysts for a significant price increase. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability of a price rise but acknowledge the limited direct impact of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success has caused a broad sell-off in tech stocks, impacting companies heavily involved in AI development like Nvidia, Apple's direct involvement is less pronounced.  The news focuses on the impact on AI-related spending and the potential for slower adoption of high-performance computing, which could affect companies like Nvidia more significantly. Apple's upcoming earnings report will be crucial, as investors seek clarity on the company's own AI investments and potential impact from the DeepSeek model.  The fact that DeepSeek's app became a top download on the Apple App Store is a positive, albeit indirectly related factor, showing continued strength in Apple's ecosystem.  However, the general negative market sentiment and concerns about AI spending could still negatively influence Apple's stock price, at least in the short term. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the difference isn't drastic considering the indirect nature of the news's impact on Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending. BofA analysts cite several factors that could drive Apple's stock higher, including its defensive nature, potential benefits from edge AI, upcoming product launches (iPhone SE, iPhone 17), insourcing of modem production, and the WWDC in June featuring AI-driven use cases. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given the bullish analyst sentiment, the defensive appeal, and multiple growth catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue, but its stock trades at an above-average valuation. This implies that while the company's financial performance is strong, its stock price may be overvalued. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of it falling is higher due to potential correction from overvaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the positive performance of Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in 2024, suggesting strong investor interest and favorable market conditions. Despite some mixed predictions, the overall sentiment towards Apple is optimistic due to its solid gains and influence on major indexes like the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500. Analysts mention growth catalysts such as new product launches and defensive characteristics which could drive stock prices higher. There are also concerns related to market sell-offs and AI spending that could create short-term volatility. However, the positive context of maintaining strong revenue and market position suggests a higher likelihood for stock price appreciation. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires. While Apple is mentioned as a top holding within a specific Legal & General fund (Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust) favored by these investors, this is an indirect indicator. The overall investment strategy of this group leans towards blue-chip companies and established funds, suggesting a risk-averse approach. The article doesn't convey any specific negative factors concerning Apple; it may marginally support a stable outlook due to the fund's past performance. Considering differing expert views in previous rounds and potential instability, I estimate slight stability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success caused a broad tech sell-off, impacting AI-focused companies like Nvidia more directly,  Apple's involvement is less pronounced.  The concern is the potential impact on AI spending and slower high-performance computing adoption, which could indirectly affect companies like Apple. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is crucial. The DeepSeek app's success on the Apple App Store is a positive sign, highlighting Apple's ecosystem strength. The overall market sentiment is negative, but the previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering the indirect impact of the news, the overall probability of a price rise is slightly lower than a fall, considering the general negative sentiment and uncertainty around future AI spending.  The previous predictions show significant diversity of opinion, adding further complexity to the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending.

Given the bullish analyst sentiment, the defensive appeal, and multiple growth catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall in the near term. The previous predictions also show a trend of higher probability for price rise, especially from models that focused on the positive aspects of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue, but its stock trades at an above-average valuation. This implies that while the company's financial performance is strong, its stock price may be overvalued. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a price rise due to positive performance and defensive nature, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to potential correction from overvaluation. However, the overall trend of the predictions suggests that the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without having to invest heavily in large language models or infrastructure, according to Baird analysts. Despite the emergence of a competitive AI model by DeepSeek, analysts suggest that Apple's competitive position remains strong. While there is some concern about market sentiment regarding AI spending, Apple appears less exposed and has the potential to capitalize on AI through its consumer products. Additionally, historical trends show strong performance for Apple, further supporting the positive outlook. The various predictions provided suggest mixed signals, but overall, the bullish signals from analysts outweigh the concerns, indicating a higher probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position among the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which have experienced solid gains in 2024. Positive sentiments from analysts regarding Apple's potential to benefit from upcoming product launches and its defensive characteristics contribute to an optimistic outlook for the stock. However, concerns over market volatility and AI-related spending provide a counterpoint. Taking into account these mixed sentiments, the probabilities lean more towards a rise in stock price due to the overarching positive context and trend of recent predictions favoring growth.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires, noting their tendency to invest in established blue-chip companies and funds. Apple is indirectly mentioned as a significant holding of the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which is a popular fund among this group. While this suggests some positive sentiment towards Apple, the article doesn't offer specific news or catalysts directly impacting Apple's stock. Considering that these investors generally prefer stable, lower-risk investments, it may indicate long-term confidence but not necessarily lead to a short-term price surge. The previous round of predictions shows mixed sentiment with a slight trend towards a more neutral or slightly negative outlook, likely due to general concerns about AI spending and market volatility. Taking all of this into account, I will give a slight edge to stock pric rise, but not as confident with the last round of prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The DeepSeek AI model's success caused a broad tech sell-off, impacting AI-focused companies more directly than Apple. The concern is the potential impact on AI spending and slower high-performance computing adoption, which could indirectly affect Apple.  However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is crucial, and the DeepSeek app's success on the Apple App Store is a positive, albeit indirect, indicator of Apple's ecosystem strength.  The overall market sentiment is somewhat negative, but the previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering the indirect impact of the news and the upcoming earnings report, which could significantly outweigh this news, I've assigned a slightly higher probability for a rise than a fall. The prior predictions show a trend towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, although there's considerable uncertainty. I'm weighting the near-term uncertainty due to market reaction and the upcoming earnings more heavily than the longer-term impact of DeepSeek's model.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a price rise due to positive performance and defensive nature, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to potential correction from overvaluation. However, the overall trend of the predictions suggests that the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall. Given the information provided and analyzing the trend of others' beliefs, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is around 0.48 and the probability of the stock price falling is around 0.52.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without having to invest heavily in large language models or infrastructure, according to Baird analysts. Despite the emergence of a competitive AI model by DeepSeek, analysts suggest that Apple's competitive position remains strong. While there is some concern about market sentiment regarding AI spending, Apple appears less exposed and has the potential to capitalize on AI through its consumer products. Additionally, historical trends show strong performance for Apple, further supporting the positive outlook. The various predictions provided suggest mixed signals, but overall, the bullish signals from analysts outweigh the concerns, indicating a higher probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall analysis of the news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates a strong position among the Magnificent Seven stocks, which have shown solid gains in 2024, reflecting good investor interest. Analyst sentiment remains optimistic due to upcoming product launches and Apple's defensive characteristics. However, there are concerns regarding market volatility and the potential impact of AI-related spending, which can lead to short-term volatility. Considering the positive context of sustained strong revenue and market position alongside mixed sentiments, the probabilities lean slightly more toward a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires. Apple is indirectly mentioned as a top holding within a specific fund, which is popular among this group. This indicates some level of confidence in Apple from a specific investor demographic. However, the news doesn't provide any direct, significant catalysts for a price increase. The previous round predictions are mixed. Considering the overall conservative investment strategy of ISA millionaires, combined with absence of immediately impactful news, and the slight trend toward a neutral rather than positive outlook in the previous round predictions, I lean towards a slightly positive influence without expecting a major price movement. Thus, probability of stock price rising is 0.54 and falling is slightly less.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The DeepSeek AI model's success triggered a broad tech sell-off, impacting AI-focused companies more directly than Apple. Concerns exist regarding the impact on AI spending and slower high-performance computing adoption, which could indirectly affect Apple. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is critical, and the DeepSeek app's success on the Apple App Store is a positive indirect indicator.  The overall market sentiment is somewhat negative, but previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities.  Apple's relatively less direct exposure to the AI spending slowdown, its strong ecosystem demonstrated by the DeepSeek app's success on its app store,  and the potential for positive news from its upcoming earnings report point towards a higher likelihood of a rise than a fall.  The previous predictions show a tendency towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but the uncertainty is considerable. I am weighting the near-term uncertainty more heavily than the longer-term impact of DeepSeek's model, especially given the conflicting predictions from previous models. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a tendency towards mildly positive movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending.

The previous predictions also show a trend of higher probability for price rise, especially from models that focused on the positive aspects of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) but discuss the Q3 earnings of consumer electronics stocks, including Sonos (SONO), GoPro (GPRO), and Peloton (PTON). Apple's Q3 earnings were mentioned, with revenues of $94.93 billion, up 6.1% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. The stock price of Apple has held steady, up 2% since the results. Considering the positive earnings report and the overall trend of predictions from previous rounds, which show a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than falling. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, but many models focus on the positive aspects of Apple's performance and defensive nature, suggesting a higher likelihood of a price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should Investors Load Up on Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests a consideration of the stock's potential for growth, but the content notes that Apple trades at an above-average valuation. Analyzing the previous predictions from various models, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a price rise due to positive performance and defensive nature, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to potential correction from overvaluation. Considering the trend of others' beliefs and the information provided, the probability of the stock price rising seems to be slightly lower than the probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to concerns about overvaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without having to invest heavily in large language models or infrastructure, according to Baird analysts.
