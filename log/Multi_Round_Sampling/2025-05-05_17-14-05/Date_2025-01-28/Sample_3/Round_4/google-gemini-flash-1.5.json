(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other Magnificent Seven stocks in 2024, indicating strong investor interest and possibly favorable market conditions. Given that Apple has shown solid gains alongside its peers, it is likely that this trend will continue, creating a higher probability of stock price rise. However, market conditions can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk of a price adjustment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment behavior of UK ISA millionaires and their preferences for blue-chip stocks and popular funds. While the article does mention that Apple (AAPL) is a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust fund, this is a relatively indirect reference. The news does not directly impact Apple's fundamentals. ISA millionaires' preference for stable, dividend-paying stocks suggests they seek lower-risk investments. The fund itself has performed well (up nearly 38%), indicating that indirectly holding the share is beneficial to an older, wealthier profile with high risk tolerance and disposable funds. While there is no explicit negative information about Apple, the article doesn't provide strong catalysts for a significant price increase. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability of a price rise but acknowledge the limited direct impact of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success has caused a broad sell-off in tech stocks, impacting companies heavily involved in AI development like Nvidia, Apple's direct involvement is less pronounced.  The news focuses on the impact on AI-related spending and the potential for slower adoption of high-performance computing, which could affect companies like Nvidia more significantly. Apple's upcoming earnings report will be crucial, as investors seek clarity on the company's own AI investments and potential impact from the DeepSeek model.  The fact that DeepSeek's app became a top download on the Apple App Store is a positive, albeit indirectly related factor, showing continued strength in Apple's ecosystem.  However, the general negative market sentiment and concerns about AI spending could still negatively influence Apple's stock price, at least in the short term. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the difference isn't drastic considering the indirect nature of the news's impact on Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending. BofA analysts cite several factors that could drive Apple's stock higher, including its defensive nature, potential benefits from edge AI, upcoming product launches (iPhone SE, iPhone 17), insourcing of modem production, and the WWDC in June featuring AI-driven use cases. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given the bullish analyst sentiment, the defensive appeal, and multiple growth catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue, but its stock trades at an above-average valuation. This implies that while the company's financial performance is strong, its stock price may be overvalued. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of it falling is higher due to potential correction from overvaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the positive performance of Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in 2024, suggesting strong investor interest and favorable market conditions. Despite some mixed predictions, the overall sentiment towards Apple is optimistic due to its solid gains and influence on major indexes like the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500. Analysts mention growth catalysts such as new product launches and defensive characteristics which could drive stock prices higher. There are also concerns related to market sell-offs and AI spending that could create short-term volatility. However, the positive context of maintaining strong revenue and market position suggests a higher likelihood for stock price appreciation. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires. While Apple is mentioned as a top holding within a specific Legal & General fund (Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust) favored by these investors, this is an indirect indicator. The overall investment strategy of this group leans towards blue-chip companies and established funds, suggesting a risk-averse approach. The article doesn't convey any specific negative factors concerning Apple; it may marginally support a stable outlook due to the fund's past performance. Considering differing expert views in previous rounds and potential instability, I estimate slight stability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success caused a broad tech sell-off, impacting AI-focused companies like Nvidia more directly,  Apple's involvement is less pronounced.  The concern is the potential impact on AI spending and slower high-performance computing adoption, which could indirectly affect companies like Apple. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is crucial. The DeepSeek app's success on the Apple App Store is a positive sign, highlighting Apple's ecosystem strength. The overall market sentiment is negative, but the previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering the indirect impact of the news, the overall probability of a price rise is slightly lower than a fall, considering the general negative sentiment and uncertainty around future AI spending.  The previous predictions show significant diversity of opinion, adding further complexity to the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending.

Given the bullish analyst sentiment, the defensive appeal, and multiple growth catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall in the near term.

Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue, but its stock trades at an above-average valuation. This implies that while the company's financial performance is strong, its stock price may be overvalued. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a price rise due to positive performance and defensive nature, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to potential correction from overvaluation. However, the overall trend of the predictions suggests that the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without having to invest heavily in large language models or infrastructure, according to Baird analysts. Despite the emergence of a competitive AI model by DeepSeek, analysts suggest that Apple's competitive position remains strong. While there is some concern about market sentiment regarding AI spending, Apple appears less exposed and has the potential to capitalize on AI through its consumer products. Additionally, historical trends show strong performance for Apple, further supporting the positive outlook. The various predictions provided suggest mixed signals, but overall, the bullish signals from analysts outweigh the concerns, indicating a higher probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position among the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which have experienced solid gains in 2024. Positive sentiments from analysts regarding Apple's potential to benefit from upcoming product launches and its defensive characteristics contribute to an optimistic outlook for the stock. However, concerns over market volatility and AI-related spending provide a counterpoint. Taking into account these mixed sentiments, the probabilities lean more towards a rise in stock price due to the overarching positive context and trend of recent predictions favoring growth.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires, noting their tendency to invest in established blue-chip companies and funds. Apple is indirectly mentioned as a significant holding of the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which is a popular fund among this group. While this suggests some positive sentiment towards Apple, the article doesn't offer specific news or catalysts directly impacting Apple's stock. Considering that these investors generally prefer stable, lower-risk investments, it may indicate long-term confidence but not necessarily lead to a short-term price surge. The previous round of predictions shows mixed sentiment with a slight trend towards a more neutral or slightly negative outlook, likely due to general concerns about AI spending and market volatility. Taking all of this into account, I will give a slight edge to stock pric rise, but not as confident with the last round of prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.

The overall market sentiment is somewhat negative, but the previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering the indirect impact of the news and the upcoming earnings report, which could significantly outweigh this news, I've assigned a slightly higher probability for a rise than a fall. The prior predictions show a trend towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, although there's considerable uncertainty. I'm weighting the near-term uncertainty due to market reaction and the upcoming earnings more heavily than the longer-term impact of DeepSeek's model.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a price rise due to positive performance and defensive nature, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to potential correction from overvaluation. However, the overall trend of the predictions suggests that the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall. Given the information provided and analyzing the trend of others' beliefs, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is around 0.48 and the probability of the stock price falling is around 0.52.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without having to invest heavily in large language models or infrastructure, according to Baird analysts. Despite the emergence of a competitive AI model by DeepSeek, analysts suggest that Apple's competitive position remains strong. While there is some concern about market sentiment regarding AI spending, Apple appears less exposed and has the potential to capitalize on AI through its consumer products. Additionally, historical trends show strong performance for Apple, further supporting the positive outlook. The various predictions provided suggest mixed signals, but overall, the bullish signals from analysts outweigh the concerns, indicating a higher probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall analysis of the news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates a strong position among the Magnificent Seven stocks, which have shown solid gains in 2024, reflecting good investor interest. Analyst sentiment remains optimistic due to upcoming product launches and Apple's defensive characteristics. However, there are concerns regarding market volatility and the potential impact of AI-related spending, which can lead to short-term volatility. Considering the positive context of sustained strong revenue and market position alongside mixed sentiments, the probabilities lean slightly more toward a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires. Apple is indirectly mentioned as a top holding within a specific fund, which is popular among this group. This indicates some level of confidence in Apple from a specific investor demographic. However, the news doesn't provide any direct, significant catalysts for a price increase. The previous round predictions are mixed. Considering the overall conservative investment strategy of ISA millionaires, combined with absence of immediately impactful news, and the slight trend toward a neutral rather than positive outlook in the previous round predictions, I lean towards a slightly positive influence without expecting a major price movement. Thus, probability of stock price rising is 0.54 and falling is slightly less.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The DeepSeek AI model's success triggered a broad tech sell-off, impacting AI-focused companies more directly than Apple. Concerns exist regarding the impact on AI spending and slower high-performance computing adoption, which could indirectly affect Apple. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is critical, and the DeepSeek app's success on the Apple App Store is a positive indirect indicator.  The overall market sentiment is somewhat negative, but previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities.  Apple's relatively less direct exposure to the AI spending slowdown, its strong ecosystem demonstrated by the DeepSeek app's success on its app store,  and the potential for positive news from its upcoming earnings report point towards a higher likelihood of a rise than a fall.  The previous predictions show a tendency towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but the uncertainty is considerable. I am weighting the near-term uncertainty more heavily than the longer-term impact of DeepSeek's model, especially given the conflicting predictions from previous models. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a tendency towards mildly positive movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off triggered by concerns over AI-related spending.

(AAPL) but discuss the Q3 earnings of consumer electronics stocks, including Sonos (SONO), GoPro (GPRO), and Peloton (PTON). Apple's Q3 earnings were mentioned, with revenues of $94.93 billion, up 6.1% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. The stock price of Apple has held steady, up 2% since the results. Considering the positive earnings report and the overall trend of predictions from previous rounds, which show a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than falling. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, but many models focus on the positive aspects of Apple's performance and defensive nature, suggesting a higher likelihood of a price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should Investors Load Up on Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests a consideration of the stock's potential for growth, but the content notes that Apple trades at an above-average valuation. Analyzing the previous predictions from various models, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a price rise due to positive performance and defensive nature, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to potential correction from overvaluation. Considering the trend of others' beliefs and the information provided, the probability of the stock price rising seems to be slightly lower than the probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to concerns about overvaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without having to invest heavily in large language models or infrastructure, according to Baird analysts.
