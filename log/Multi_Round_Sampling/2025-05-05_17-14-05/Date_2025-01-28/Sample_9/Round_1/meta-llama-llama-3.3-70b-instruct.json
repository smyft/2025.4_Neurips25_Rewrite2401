(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why AAPL Is Climbing Today\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) is advancing 4% today after a research firm reported that the company's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter. Earlier this month, another research firm stated that AAPL had dropped to third place in terms of smartphone market share in the Asian country.Dan Niles on Apple (AAPL): Data is \u2018Somewhat Disappointing\u2019 and Stock is \u2018Pretty Expensive\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nThe iPhone Was Reportedly the Q4 Market Share Leader in China\n\nThe device's market share in China came in at 17.4% last quarter, the International Data Corporation (IDC) reported. That was slightly above second-place Huawei's 17.2% share. However, the device's market share was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, when it controlled 20% of the market. Further, for all of 2024, its market share dropped to 15.6% from 17.4% in 2023.\n\nLast week, another research firm, Counterpoint, reported that the iPhone's market share had been 17.1% in China last quarter, leaving the device in third place in the huge market. Counterpoint added that the number of devices handed over by Apple in China had tumbled 18.2% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier. In Q4 of 2023, iPhone's market share was 20.2%.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of AAPL Stock\n\nIn the last month, the shares have fallen 4.5%, while they are up 2.5% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the news surrounding Apple Inc. indicates several factors that could impact its stock price. While there is potential for revenue growth in Services and Mac sales, concerns regarding declining iPhone sales, competitive pressures in China, and a stretched valuation lead to a cautious outlook. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), signaling negative sentiment. Given these mixed signals, there seems to be a higher chance of a fall in stock price following the earnings report, especially if the actual results underperform expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Initially, the DeepSeek AI model sparked concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, potentially negatively impacting companies like Apple who are actively investing in AI. However, the analysis from T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that the DeepSeek innovation could actually *increase* compute intensity (GPU usage) in the medium term, which could *benefit* companies developing and deploying AI. The article also points out that the future of AI spending depends on the specific business models of each company. Given that Apple is a major player in AI and has significant resources, it's likely they will adapt and continue investing in AI. The \"easing\" of the tech selloff is also a positive signal. Furthermore, while the news mentions Nvidia benefiting from increasing compute needs, it is less direct and might not affect Apple's stock price as much as the immediate concerns regarding Apple's AI spending. Overall, the mixed signals create uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to the tech selloff easing, potential medium term benefits from DeepSeek, and Apple's diverse business model.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, including Apple. While Apple's revenue beat analyst expectations slightly and operating income exceeded expectations, its Services segment missed.  The overall market is experiencing some uncertainty due to recent rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration.  The article states Apple's stock is up 2% since the results. This positive movement, despite a mixed quarter, suggests market sentiment towards Apple is currently positive, potentially outweighing the concerns about the Services segment.  However, the general market uncertainty introduces some risk. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the relatively neutral nature of the Apple-specific news within a broader uncertain market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's new AI initiative and its strategic partnerships with companies like Google Cloud, Meta, NVIDIA, and Vultr. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of market movers, the news does not directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. Apple's stock price movement is more likely influenced by broader market trends or company-specific news not covered here. Given the lack of direct relevance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares after the DeepSeek selloff. BofA analysts believe that Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They also highlight several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investors' confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive development for the company. However, the market share has declined compared to the previous year, and another research firm reported a lower market share, leaving Apple in third place. Additionally, Dan Niles stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Despite current uncertainties surrounding the AI sector and its potential impacts, the Senior Portfolio Manager remains optimistic, suggesting that the sector's valuations could justify current stock prices. This positive sentiment should support a bullish tone for Apple's stock. However, short-term fluctuations due to market concerns around technology growth and capital expenditures need to be considered.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
