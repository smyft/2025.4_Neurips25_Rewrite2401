(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\nNews Content: Investing.com -- The stock market suffered a sharp sell-off Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.46% and the Nasdaq falling 3% after Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough sparked concerns over lower AI-related spending.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America believe that the pullback created idiosyncratic buy opportunities in certain stocks. They highlighted Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), noting that \u201ceach name has compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/datacenter spending.\u201d\n\nBofA also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), citing their defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility.\n\nApple is one of the rare technology stocks that rose higher on Monday.\n\n\u201cOn a day when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, Apple shares were up 3% as investors realize the potential for edge AI and there is a flight to safety driven by Apple\u2019s earnings resiliency,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan noted.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is truly able to lower the cost of AI inferencing and better models are developed faster and cheaper, then edge AI applications and Apple as the edge device maker, stands to benefit. We view Apple as the ultimate play on having an LLM in your pocket,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA analysts believe several key drivers could drive upside in the tech giant\u2019s shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE in March or April, insourcing of modem production to improve gross margins, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025.\n\nFor IBM, BofA highlighted catalysts including a new mainframe cycle, acceleration in its Software (ETR:SOWGn) division, and mergers and acquisitions activity. Analysts project higher growth in Software for the next three years, driven by Enterprise AI opportunities and the launch of a new Mainframe (z17) in 2025.\n\n\u201cFor IBM, AI represents an opportunity in its Consulting business as it seeks to position itself as the go-to partner of choice for AI consulting.\n\nCorning's stock fell by 8.7% on Monday, but BofA analysts point out multiple key drivers that could foster recovery and growth. These include the cyclical recovery in its Optical business, the Lumen/Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program ramps, opportunities in the Solar sector, consistent profitability in the Display segment, and its upcoming Investor Day on March 18.\n\nFor HPE, which saw its shares sink 5.8%, the firm points to the Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) acquisition and cost reduction initiatives as factors that could improve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAI server exposure is not embedded in the valuation multiple,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan added.\n\nBofA also sees a significant value unlock for Western Digital with its anticipated spin-off, estimating value creation between $5-10 billion. The firm also references the SanDisk Analyst Day (February 11) and Western Digital Analyst Day (February 12) as key catalysts. The company\u2019s stock lost 4.5% Monday.\n\nSeagate also saw a pullback, but BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing improvements in the HDD industry structure since the last downturn.\n\nThe company's focus on ramping up Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology, increasing gross margins through a higher mix of high-capacity/HAMR drives, and continued data center spending (excluding AI) are seen as primary growth drivers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\n\nMorgan Stanley cuts Nvidia stock target after DeepSeek release\n\nUS stock futures edge higher; Fed meeting, tech sector in focus\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the news surrounding Apple Inc. indicates several factors that could impact its stock price. While there is potential for revenue growth in Services and Mac sales, concerns regarding declining iPhone sales, competitive pressures in China, and a stretched valuation lead to a cautious outlook. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), signaling negative sentiment. Given these mixed signals, there seems to be a higher chance of a fall in stock price following the earnings report, especially if the actual results underperform expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Initially, the DeepSeek AI model sparked concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, potentially negatively impacting companies like Apple who are actively investing in AI. However, the analysis from T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that the DeepSeek innovation could actually *increase* compute intensity (GPU usage) in the medium term, which could *benefit* companies developing and deploying AI. The article also points out that the future of AI spending depends on the specific business models of each company. Given that Apple is a major player in AI and has significant resources, it's likely they will adapt and continue investing in AI. The \"easing\" of the tech selloff is also a positive signal. Furthermore, while the news mentions Nvidia benefiting from increasing compute needs, it is less direct and might not affect Apple's stock price as much as the immediate concerns regarding Apple's AI spending. Overall, the mixed signals create uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to the tech selloff easing, potential medium term benefits from DeepSeek, and Apple's diverse business model.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, including Apple. While Apple's revenue beat analyst expectations slightly and operating income exceeded expectations, its Services segment missed.  The overall market is experiencing some uncertainty due to recent rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration.  The article states Apple's stock is up 2% since the results. This positive movement, despite a mixed quarter, suggests market sentiment towards Apple is currently positive, potentially outweighing the concerns about the Services segment.  However, the general market uncertainty introduces some risk. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the relatively neutral nature of the Apple-specific news within a broader uncertain market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's new AI initiative and its strategic partnerships with companies like Google Cloud, Meta, NVIDIA, and Vultr. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of market movers, the news does not directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. Apple's stock price movement is more likely influenced by broader market trends or company-specific news not covered here. Given the lack of direct relevance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares after the DeepSeek selloff. BofA analysts believe that Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They also highlight several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investors' confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive development for the company. However, the market share has declined compared to the previous year, and another research firm reported a lower market share, leaving Apple in third place. Additionally, Dan Niles stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Despite current uncertainties surrounding the AI sector and its potential impacts, the Senior Portfolio Manager remains optimistic, suggesting that the sector's valuations could justify current stock prices. This positive sentiment should support a bullish tone for Apple's stock. However, short-term fluctuations due to market concerns around technology growth and capital expenditures need to be considered.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis indicates a mixed outlook for Apple due to several factors. While the Services and Mac segments may show growth, there are significant concerns regarding declining iPhone sales, particularly with increased competition in China and the potential impact of a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence. The company's Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) suggests negative sentiment around its prospects. Historical earnings surprises have been positive but the current economic landscape and stretched valuation lead to a cautious outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling appears higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the implications of DeepSeek AI's innovation on Big Tech's AI spending, including Apple. While initial concerns about reduced spending arose, T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that DeepSeek's advance could actually increase compute intensity, potentially benefiting companies like Apple in the medium term. The easing of the initial tech sell-off further supports a slightly positive outlook. However, Rizzo stresses that AI spending levels depend on individual business models, adding a layer of uncertainty. Considering previous rounds, beliefs ranged from significant falls to moderate rises, with the most recent models leaning towards positive movement again. The range of predictions indicates significant uncertainty. Based on this, I believe Apple is more likely to rise slightly, but a fall is also considerable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, with Apple being only one of several discussed.  Apple's results were mixed: slightly beating revenue expectations but missing on its Services segment.  The stock is reported to be up 2% since the earnings release, suggesting a positive market reaction despite the mixed results. However, the article emphasizes broader market uncertainties related to interest rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration.  The analysis of other companies' performance in the same sector further emphasizes this context,  showing varying responses to earnings reports. Therefore, while Apple's own results were mildly positive, the overall context suggests that the probability of a stock price rise or fall is likely close to even.  The previous predictions show a significant range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the broader market environment, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a rise given that the stock is already up 2% post-earnings, implying the market may be taking a largely positive view of things, but the probability remains relatively close to 50/50.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's AI initiatives and partnerships, which do not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price movement is more likely influenced by broader market trends or company-specific news not covered here. Given the lack of direct relevance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal. However, considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the general market context, there is a slight tilt towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong market position and recent positive performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares after the DeepSeek selloff. BofA analysts believe that Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy.

Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investors' confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications. Considering these positive factors and the overall market context, it seems that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive development for the company. However, the market share has declined compared to the previous year, and another research firm reported a lower market share, leaving Apple in third place. Additionally, Dan Niles stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. However, the fact that the stock is already up 4% today and the general trend of others' predictions suggests that there might be some positive sentiment towards the stock. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.52 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.48.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple.
