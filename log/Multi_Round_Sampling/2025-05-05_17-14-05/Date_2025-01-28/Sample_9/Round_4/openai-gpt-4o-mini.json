(AAPL)\nNews Headline: The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Dell Technologies, HP and Microsoft\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 28, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBuy, Sell or Hold Apple Stock? Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAppleis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nApple expects the December quarter's (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAAPL's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\n\nLet's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple's iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple's fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion.\n\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple's installed base has been a concern.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL's Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\n\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple's Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple's Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple's estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC's vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo's growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies and HP saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies' 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple's market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\n\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner's list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 27.5%.\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 27.54X.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL's Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nApple's AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul.\n\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \"Magnificent 7\" group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple's stringent privacy standards.\n\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple's near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\n\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the news surrounding Apple Inc. indicates several factors that could impact its stock price. While there is potential for revenue growth in Services and Mac sales, concerns regarding declining iPhone sales, competitive pressures in China, and a stretched valuation lead to a cautious outlook. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), signaling negative sentiment. Given these mixed signals, there seems to be a higher chance of a fall in stock price following the earnings report, especially if the actual results underperform expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Initially, the DeepSeek AI model sparked concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, potentially negatively impacting companies like Apple who are actively investing in AI. However, the analysis from T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that the DeepSeek innovation could actually *increase* compute intensity (GPU usage) in the medium term, which could *benefit* companies developing and deploying AI. The article also points out that the future of AI spending depends on the specific business models of each company. Given that Apple is a major player in AI and has significant resources, it's likely they will adapt and continue investing in AI. The \"easing\" of the tech selloff is also a positive signal. Furthermore, while the news mentions Nvidia benefiting from increasing compute needs, it is less direct and might not affect Apple's stock price as much as the immediate concerns regarding Apple's AI spending. Overall, the mixed signals create uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to the tech selloff easing, potential medium term benefits from DeepSeek, and Apple's diverse business model.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, including Apple. While Apple's revenue beat analyst expectations slightly and operating income exceeded expectations, its Services segment missed.  The overall market is experiencing some uncertainty due to recent rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration.  The article states Apple's stock is up 2% since the results. This positive movement, despite a mixed quarter, suggests market sentiment towards Apple is currently positive, potentially outweighing the concerns about the Services segment.  However, the general market uncertainty introduces some risk. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the relatively neutral nature of the Apple-specific news within a broader uncertain market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's new AI initiative and its strategic partnerships with companies like Google Cloud, Meta, NVIDIA, and Vultr. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of market movers, the news does not directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. Apple's stock price movement is more likely influenced by broader market trends or company-specific news not covered here. Given the lack of direct relevance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares after the DeepSeek selloff. BofA analysts believe that Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They also highlight several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investors' confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive development for the company. However, the market share has declined compared to the previous year, and another research firm reported a lower market share, leaving Apple in third place. Additionally, Dan Niles stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Despite current uncertainties surrounding the AI sector and its potential impacts, the Senior Portfolio Manager remains optimistic, suggesting that the sector's valuations could justify current stock prices. This positive sentiment should support a bullish tone for Apple's stock. However, short-term fluctuations due to market concerns around technology growth and capital expenditures need to be considered.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis indicates a mixed outlook for Apple due to several factors. While the Services and Mac segments may show growth, there are significant concerns regarding declining iPhone sales, particularly with increased competition in China and the potential impact of a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence. The company's Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) suggests negative sentiment around its prospects. Historical earnings surprises have been positive but the current economic landscape and stretched valuation lead to a cautious outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling appears higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the implications of DeepSeek AI's innovation on Big Tech's AI spending, including Apple. While initial concerns about reduced spending arose, T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that DeepSeek's advance could actually increase compute intensity, potentially benefiting companies like Apple in the medium term. The easing of the initial tech sell-off further supports a slightly positive outlook. However, Rizzo stresses that AI spending levels depend on individual business models, adding a layer of uncertainty. Considering previous rounds, beliefs ranged from significant falls to moderate rises, with the most recent models leaning towards positive movement again. The range of predictions indicates significant uncertainty. Based on this, I believe Apple is more likely to rise slightly, but a fall is also considerable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, with Apple being only one of several discussed.  Apple's results were mixed: slightly beating revenue expectations but missing on its Services segment.  The stock is reported to be up 2% since the earnings release, suggesting a positive market reaction despite the mixed results. However, the article emphasizes broader market uncertainties related to interest rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration.  The analysis of other companies' performance in the same sector further emphasizes this context,  showing varying responses to earnings reports. Therefore, while Apple's own results were mildly positive, the overall context suggests that the probability of a stock price rise or fall is likely close to even.  The previous predictions show a significant range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the broader market environment, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a rise given that the stock is already up 2% post-earnings, implying the market may be taking a largely positive view of things, but the probability remains relatively close to 50/50.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's AI initiatives and partnerships, which do not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price movement is more likely influenced by broader market trends or company-specific news not covered here. Given the lack of direct relevance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal. However, considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the general market context, there is a slight tilt towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong market position and recent positive performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares after the DeepSeek selloff. BofA analysts believe that Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They highlight several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investors' confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications. Considering these positive factors and the overall market context, it seems that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive development for the company. However, the market share has declined compared to the previous year, and another research firm reported a lower market share, leaving Apple in third place. Additionally, Dan Niles stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. However, the fact that the stock is already up 4% today and the general trend of others' predictions suggests that there might be some positive sentiment towards the stock. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.52 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.48.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Despite current uncertainties surrounding the AI sector and its potential impacts, the Senior Portfolio Manager remains optimistic, suggesting that the sector's valuations could justify current stock prices. This positive sentiment should support a bullish tone for Apple's stock. However, short-term fluctuations due to market concerns around technology growth and capital expenditures need to be considered.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news surrounding Apple Inc. presents a mixed outlook. Concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, coupled with competition and a stretched valuation, suggest negative sentiment. However, the Services segment is expected to show steady growth, and historical earnings surprises indicate a consistent ability to beat estimates. Despite a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) reflecting current bearish sentiment, the overall market sentiment appears cautious yet slightly optimistic given the anticipated revenue growth in Services and Mac sales. Considering all these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek AI's advancements on Big Tech's AI spending, including Apple. While initially causing concern about reduced spending, the analysis from T. Rowe Price suggests it could increase compute intensity, potentially benefiting Apple. The easing of the tech sell-off further supports a slightly positive outlook. However, business model specifics add uncertainty. Considering previous predictions, there's a mix, but recent models lean slightly positive. Considering the initial selloff easing and potential medium-term benefits, rising looks a little more probable, but there is still the probability of a fall. I am slightly increasing the probability of rise as the market may be more optimistic.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, with Apple being only one of several discussed. Apple's results were mixed: slightly beating revenue expectations but missing on its Services segment.  The stock is reported to be up 2% since the earnings release, suggesting a positive market reaction despite the mixed results.  However, the article emphasizes broader market uncertainties related to interest rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration. This creates a complex situation where the direct impact of Apple's earnings is lessened by broader market forces and the inherent uncertainty of the news cycle.  Analysis of other companies' performance in the same sector further emphasizes this context, showing varying responses to their earnings reports.  The previous predictions provide a range of probabilities, from a significant fall to a moderate rise, with a slight trend towards positive sentiment after the first round of predictions.  Considering the mixed signals from the news and the previous predictions, the probability of a stock price increase is slightly higher due to the current positive market reaction; however, the broader market uncertainty and mixed earnings results mean that a price fall is not unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's AI initiatives and partnerships, which do not directly impact Apple Inc.

Given the lack of direct relevance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal.

Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. However, the fact that the stock is already up 4% today and the general trend of others' predictions suggests that there might be some positive sentiment towards the stock. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, from a high probability of a rise to a high probability of a fall, indicating significant uncertainty. Given the mixed signals and the overall market context, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.55 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.45.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Senior Portfolio Manager Margie Patel's projection of 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025 justifies current valuations, which lends a positive sentiment. This optimism should favorably influence investor perception and potentially lead to an upward movement in Apple\u2019s stock price. However, market uncertainty, competitive pressures, and mixed signals from recent rounds of predictions introduce some caution.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news surrounding Apple Inc. presents a mixed outlook leading up to the Q1 earnings report. While positive growth is anticipated in the Services and Mac segments, concerns persist regarding declining iPhone sales due to competition in China and a potential delay in launching Apple Intelligence. This is echoed by the current Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment. Predictions from analysts show a wide range, but a consistent highlight is the mixed sentiment regarding Apple's financial performance. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability for stock price decline due to the uncertainties related to iPhone sales and overall market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news focuses on the implications of DeepSeek AI's advancements on Big Tech's AI spending, including Apple. While the initial reaction to DeepSeek's AI was concerns regarding reduced AI spending, T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager's analysis suggests that DeepSeek's advance could actually increase compute intensity, potentially benefiting AI investors like Apple in the medium term. The easing of the tech sell-off further supports a more positive outlook. Several previous predictions lean towards a slightly positive outlook. Given the arguments made, I believe that there is a greater chance of it rising. However, the opposing viewpoints should still be considered. Taking all into account, the probability of rising will slightly be favored towards rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, with Apple being only one of several discussed. Apple's results were mixed: slightly beating revenue expectations but missing on its Services segment. The stock is reported to be up 2% since the earnings release, suggesting a positive market reaction despite the mixed results. However, the broader market context involves uncertainties related to interest rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration, which adds significant complexity to the outlook.  The analysis of other companies' performance further emphasizes market volatility.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, from a significant fall to a moderate rise, reflecting the considerable uncertainty surrounding the stock's immediate trajectory.  While Apple's own results were mildly positive, the general market sentiment and the mixed nature of the news itself suggest that the probability of an immediate significant price change (either up or down) is relatively low.  The slight upward movement after earnings suggests a positive market reception, but not enough to indicate a certain substantial rise. Given the mixed signals and the broader market environment, a neutral stance is most appropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's AI initiatives and partnerships, which do not directly impact Apple Inc.
