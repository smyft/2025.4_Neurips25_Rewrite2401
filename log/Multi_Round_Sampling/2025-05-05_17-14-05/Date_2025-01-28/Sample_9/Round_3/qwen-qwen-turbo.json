      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the news surrounding Apple Inc. indicates several factors that could impact its stock price. While there is potential for revenue growth in Services and Mac sales, concerns regarding declining iPhone sales, competitive pressures in China, and a stretched valuation lead to a cautious outlook. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), signaling negative sentiment. Given these mixed signals, there seems to be a higher chance of a fall in stock price following the earnings report, especially if the actual results underperform expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Initially, the DeepSeek AI model sparked concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, potentially negatively impacting companies like Apple who are actively investing in AI. However, the analysis from T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that the DeepSeek innovation could actually *increase* compute intensity (GPU usage) in the medium term, which could *benefit* companies developing and deploying AI. The article also points out that the future of AI spending depends on the specific business models of each company. Given that Apple is a major player in AI and has significant resources, it's likely they will adapt and continue investing in AI. The \"easing\" of the tech selloff is also a positive signal. Furthermore, while the news mentions Nvidia benefiting from increasing compute needs, it is less direct and might not affect Apple's stock price as much as the immediate concerns regarding Apple's AI spending. Overall, the mixed signals create uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to the tech selloff easing, potential medium term benefits from DeepSeek, and Apple's diverse business model.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, including Apple. While Apple's revenue beat analyst expectations slightly and operating income exceeded expectations, its Services segment missed.  The overall market is experiencing some uncertainty due to recent rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration.  The article states Apple's stock is up 2% since the results. This positive movement, despite a mixed quarter, suggests market sentiment towards Apple is currently positive, potentially outweighing the concerns about the Services segment.  However, the general market uncertainty introduces some risk. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the relatively neutral nature of the Apple-specific news within a broader uncertain market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's new AI initiative and its strategic partnerships with companies like Google Cloud, Meta, NVIDIA, and Vultr. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of market movers, the news does not directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. Apple's stock price movement is more likely influenced by broader market trends or company-specific news not covered here. Given the lack of direct relevance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares after the DeepSeek selloff. BofA analysts believe that Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They also highlight several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investors' confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive development for the company. However, the market share has declined compared to the previous year, and another research firm reported a lower market share, leaving Apple in third place. Additionally, Dan Niles stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Despite current uncertainties surrounding the AI sector and its potential impacts, the Senior Portfolio Manager remains optimistic, suggesting that the sector's valuations could justify current stock prices. This positive sentiment should support a bullish tone for Apple's stock. However, short-term fluctuations due to market concerns around technology growth and capital expenditures need to be considered.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis indicates a mixed outlook for Apple due to several factors. While the Services and Mac segments may show growth, there are significant concerns regarding declining iPhone sales, particularly with increased competition in China and the potential impact of a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence. The company's Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) suggests negative sentiment around its prospects. Historical earnings surprises have been positive but the current economic landscape and stretched valuation lead to a cautious outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling appears higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the implications of DeepSeek AI's innovation on Big Tech's AI spending, including Apple. While initial concerns about reduced spending arose, T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that DeepSeek's advance could actually increase compute intensity, potentially benefiting companies like Apple in the medium term. The easing of the initial tech sell-off further supports a slightly positive outlook. However, Rizzo stresses that AI spending levels depend on individual business models, adding a layer of uncertainty. Considering previous rounds, beliefs ranged from significant falls to moderate rises, with the most recent models leaning towards positive movement again. The range of predictions indicates significant uncertainty. Based on this, I believe Apple is more likely to rise slightly, but a fall is also considerable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, with Apple being only one of several discussed.  Apple's results were mixed: slightly beating revenue expectations but missing on its Services segment.  The stock is reported to be up 2% since the earnings release, suggesting a positive market reaction despite the mixed results. However, the article emphasizes broader market uncertainties related to interest rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration.  The analysis of other companies' performance in the same sector further emphasizes this context,  showing varying responses to earnings reports. Therefore, while Apple's own results were mildly positive, the overall context suggests that the probability of a stock price rise or fall is likely close to even.  The previous predictions show a significant range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the broader market environment, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a rise given that the stock is already up 2% post-earnings, implying the market may be taking a largely positive view of things, but the probability remains relatively close to 50/50.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's AI initiatives and partnerships, which do not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price movement is more likely influenced by broader market trends or company-specific news not covered here. Given the lack of direct relevance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal. However, considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the general market context, there is a slight tilt towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong market position and recent positive performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares after the DeepSeek selloff. BofA analysts believe that Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy.

Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investors' confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications. Considering these positive factors and the overall market context, it seems that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which is a positive development for the company. However, the market share has declined compared to the previous year, and another research firm reported a lower market share, leaving Apple in third place. Additionally, Dan Niles stated that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive'. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. However, the fact that the stock is already up 4% today and the general trend of others' predictions suggests that there might be some positive sentiment towards the stock. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.52 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.48.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Despite current uncertainties surrounding the AI sector and its potential impacts, the Senior Portfolio Manager remains optimistic, suggesting that the sector's valuations could justify current stock prices. This positive sentiment should support a bullish tone for Apple's stock. However, short-term fluctuations due to market concerns around technology growth and capital expenditures need to be considered.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news surrounding Apple Inc. presents a mixed outlook. Concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, coupled with competition and a stretched valuation, suggest negative sentiment. However, the Services segment is expected to show steady growth, and historical earnings surprises indicate a consistent ability to beat estimates. Despite a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) reflecting current bearish sentiment, the overall market sentiment appears cautious yet slightly optimistic given the anticipated revenue growth in Services and Mac sales. Considering all these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek AI's advancements on Big Tech's AI spending, including Apple. While initially causing concern about reduced spending, the analysis from T. Rowe Price suggests it could increase compute intensity, potentially benefiting Apple. The easing of the tech sell-off further supports a slightly positive outlook. However, business model specifics add uncertainty. Considering previous predictions, there's a mix, but recent models lean slightly positive. Considering the initial selloff easing and potential medium-term benefits, rising looks a little more probable, but there is still the probability of a fall. I am slightly increasing the probability of rise as the market may be more optimistic.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, with Apple being only one of several discussed. Apple's results were mixed: slightly beating revenue expectations but missing on its Services segment.  The stock is reported to be up 2% since the earnings release, suggesting a positive market reaction despite the mixed results.  However, the article emphasizes broader market uncertainties related to interest rate cuts and the upcoming Trump administration. This creates a complex situation where the direct impact of Apple's earnings is lessened by broader market forces and the inherent uncertainty of the news cycle.  Analysis of other companies' performance in the same sector further emphasizes this context, showing varying responses to their earnings reports.  The previous predictions provide a range of probabilities, from a significant fall to a moderate rise, with a slight trend towards positive sentiment after the first round of predictions.  Considering the mixed signals from the news and the previous predictions, the probability of a stock price increase is slightly higher due to the current positive market reaction; however, the broader market uncertainty and mixed earnings results mean that a price fall is not unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's AI initiatives and partnerships, which do not directly impact Apple Inc.

Given the mixed signals and the overall market context, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.55 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.45.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple.
