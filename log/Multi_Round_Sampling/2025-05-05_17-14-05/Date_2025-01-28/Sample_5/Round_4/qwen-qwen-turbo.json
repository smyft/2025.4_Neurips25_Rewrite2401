(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and favorable conditions for growth. Given Apple's inclusion in this group, it's likely to experience upward pressure on stock prices. However, the context regarding Tesla's slide might introduce some volatility. Overall, the bullish sentiment outweighs potential bearish trends, suggesting a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, considers Apple as a core holding ('quarterback of your portfolio') due to its consistent performance. However, the article also notes that AAPL's stock performance has been flat recently (0.18%) following a significant decline of 14% from recent highs due to analyst downgrades and reports of declining iPhone sales in China. While the article touches on AI trends, it downplays the notion of Apple as a promising AI stock as a core theme. Cramer's comments from September 2024 portray Apple as reliable, while the article highlights more recent negative developments. Given the contradictory information, I am assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise. The negative near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns mentioned in the article may have a more immediate impact than Cramer's longer-term positive view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off driven by a new AI model from DeepSeek, causing concerns about Big Tech's AI spending.  However, a portfolio manager suggests that this might lead to increased compute needs in the medium term, benefiting companies like Nvidia.  The impact on Apple is less direct. While Apple is a major technology company, the news focuses on the implications for AI spending and chip manufacturers specifically. The sell-off's easing suggests a potential rebound in the broader tech sector.  The discussion regarding Apple is indirect, focusing more on the overall landscape. Therefore, the impact on AAPL is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher chance of a price increase mirroring a general market recovery than a decrease stemming from specific concerns for Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news specific to Apple Inc. itself, but it does indicate continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds such as the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust. Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the Big Tech companies, the news does not directly imply a negative impact on Apple's earnings. However, the overall market reaction and concerns about Big Tech's dominance could lead to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Given that the news does not specifically target Apple and that Big Tech earnings have been driving stocks higher, there is a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a cautious stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and the industry's reaction to DeepSeek's breakthrough model suggests a heightened competition in the AI sector. However, this competition may lead to increased innovation and cost-effective solutions, potentially benefiting companies like Apple. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off and President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition could indicate a positive outlook for Apple's stock. Nevertheless, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is indirect, as the primary focus is on OpenAI, DeepSeek, and their respective partnerships and innovations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) could see varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the overall trend points towards a positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and positive trends in 2024, which bodes well for Apple's stock price. Previous predictions reflect a mix of opinions, but many lean towards a positive outlook for Apple based on its strong market presence and the broader tech rebound. Despite some concerns about recent performance and potential volatility from Tesla's decline, the overall sentiment remains largely bullish for Apple due to its influence in key indexes. Thus, I anticipate a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. While Jim Cramer sees it as a reliable 'quarterback' for a portfolio, the recent performance has been lackluster, with a significant drop due to analyst downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales in China. The focus on AI primarily highlights other companies and doesn't position Apple as a leading AI play, although it acknowledges Apple's ranking among AI stocks Cramer mentions. \n\nConsidering previous predictions, there's a general trend towards cautious optimism, but the mixed signals remain. Given the negative short-term factors (downgrades, sales concerns) alongside the longer-term positive sentiment from Cramer, I'm leaning towards a slightly more negative outlook than some previous predictions, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty. However, Cramer's bullish sentiment and Apple's general resilience prevent a drastic bearish prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader tech sector's reaction to DeepSeek's AI advancements and the potential impact on AI spending. While there's concern about overconcentration and reduced spending in the short term, a portfolio manager suggests that increased compute needs might offset this, benefiting companies like Nvidia. Apple's direct involvement is minimal; it's mentioned only as a 'Big Tech' player. The easing of the sell-off indicates a potential market recovery, which could positively affect Apple. However, the news doesn't offer any specific positive or negative catalysts for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a rise, although the reasoning varied significantly.  Given the indirect nature of the news and lack of specific Apple-related information, the probability of a price rise is moderate, reflecting a potential positive market effect, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low reflecting the absence of negative Apple specific news and the easing of the sell-off.  The consensus in previous predictions shows a slight bias towards stock price rising, but with considerable uncertainty..\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news specific to Apple Inc. itself, but it does indicate continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds such as the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust. Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions also reflect a mixed but generally optimistic outlook, with probabilities leaning towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and the industry's reaction to DeepSeek's breakthrough model, which suggests a heightened competition in the AI sector. However, this competition may lead to increased innovation and cost-effective solutions, potentially benefiting companies like Apple. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off and President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition could indicate a positive outlook for Apple's stock. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a mixed outlook, but most models suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential for increased innovation and cost-effective solutions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to an initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) could see varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the overall trend points towards a positive sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news identifies Apple as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which suggests strong market sentiment and indicates potential positive influence on its stock price. Previous analyses show a predominantly bullish sentiment for Apple's stock amidst its prestigious placement in major indexes. While there are mixed signals regarding recent flat performance and analyst downgrades, the overall trend in predictions leans towards a price increase due to optimism in the technology sector and Apple's ongoing relevance. I'm estimating a higher probability of upward movement compared to downward.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer, a respected market commentator, considers Apple a cornerstone of any portfolio. He draws an analogy to a successful quarterback, emphasizing its consistent performance. However, the article also highlights recent headwinds, including analyst downgrades due to disappointing iPhone sales in China, leading to overall flat performance recently (0.18%). While the article mentions Apple ranking 4th in AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about, the larger focus is on other enterprise like Oracle, Softbank and OpenAI that could benefit with an announcement of President Trumps $500 billion Stargate project. Given these mixed signals, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect the conflicting information. There is more emphasis on near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns while long-term factors are weighed slightly less.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is largely indirect regarding Apple. While it discusses a tech sell-off related to AI advancements and subsequent recovery, the impact on Apple is not explicitly stated.  The article mentions Apple as a 'Big Tech' company and briefly touches upon the potential for increased compute needs in the AI space which could benefit some tech companies, but the direct effect on AAPL remains unclear. The easing of the sell-off suggests a general positive market trend that could benefit Apple, but there's no specific positive or negative catalyst linked directly to the company in this news.  Considering previous predictions, there is a wide range of opinions, with a slight bias toward a price rise, primarily due to general market sentiment and the absence of negative Apple-specific news. However, the uncertainty surrounding the impact of AI spending changes on Apple warrants a more moderate prediction than some previous ones.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. While the article does not provide direct positive or negative news about Apple, it indicates continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions but lean slightly towards a positive outlook for Apple, given its strong market presence and general sentiment towards tech investments. The lack of company-specific negative news and the broader positive trend in tech investments suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Despite some mixed signals regarding recent performance and concerns about iPhone sales in China, the overall sentiment from prior predictions leans towards a price increase, particularly influenced by the favorable positioning within key market indexes and technology sector recovery. This optimism is supported by multiple predictions indicating a greater likelihood of stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's positive view of Apple, calling it the 'quarterback of your portfolio,' emphasizing its consistent performance. While the article acknowledges Apple's flat recent performance and challenges like analyst downgrades and declining iPhone sales in China, it also highlights Apple's presence among AI stocks. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of cautious optimism and a gradual increase in the probability of price rise. Despite some negative factors, the positive sentiment from Cramer and Apple's overall strength suggest a higher likelihood of price increase than decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is largely indirect regarding Apple's stock performance.  While it discusses a tech sell-off driven by AI advancements and a subsequent market recovery, the impact on Apple is minimal. The article mentions Apple as a 'Big Tech' player and indirectly notes the potential for increased compute needs in AI, which could benefit some tech companies but the effect on Apple remains unclear. The easing of the sell-off suggests a positive broader market sentiment, which could indirectly benefit Apple. However, the news lacks any specific positive or negative Apple-related catalysts.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the general market recovery and lack of specific Apple negative news. The uncertainty surrounding the influence of AI spending changes on Apple necessitates a moderate prediction, avoiding extreme probabilities. Considering the overall trend of slightly increasing probabilities of a rise across previous rounds, and the absence of any direct negative news, I'm leaning slightly towards an increase, but maintaining considerable uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios that include global technology funds, with Apple Inc.
