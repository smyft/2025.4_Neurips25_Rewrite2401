(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Where the UK\u2019s ISA millionaires are investing\nNews Content: The number of investors with \u00a31 million or more in their stocks and shares individual savings account (ISA) is on the rise, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's (HL.L) platform data, which revealed where they are putting their money.\n\nThe UK's biggest investment platform said there were 1,322 \"ISA millionaires\" on its platform as of the end of December.\n\nThe figure was up 14% over the previous six months alone and was much higher when compared to the 168 ISA millionaires on the platform seven years ago, with just three recorded in 2012.\n\nHL found that the average age of an ISA millionaire on its platform was now 72 years old, down from 74 six months ago. However, the gender split of ISA millionaires had not changed from two years ago, with just over two-thirds found to be men.\n\n\"Some people get into investment in the hope of getting rich quick, but the vast majority of ISA millionaires have built a fortune through the far more reliable approach of getting rich slow,\" said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at HL.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\n\"They don\u2019t necessarily take enormous risks: many consistently invest as much as possible of their annual allowance, in a diverse and balanced portfolio, every year, for decades.\"\n\nMarshall pointed out that the top 10 stocks bought by this group were dominated by UK-listed blue-chip companies, including those that have traditionally paid strong dividends.\n\n\"It means most of them aren\u2019t speculating,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not in a hurry to trade them regularly either as, while most ISA millionaires traded in 2024, this has tended to be infrequent.\"\n\nAs for the most bought funds, Marshall said ISA millionaires were investing in a broad international mix of popular funds. Half of these funds were focused on a diversified mix of global companies, though there were also a couple of UK funds on the list, including an income fund.\n\n\"This reflects that as investors get older, some of the portfolio may have been reconfigured for income,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a larger portfolio, you have more scope to add specialist funds into the mix, which is why we see a technology and India fund in the list of popular investments. Investors with a larger portfolio may be willing to take more risks, partly as they may have more scope for loss, or have sufficient stores of value elsewhere, such as cash ISAs, savings accounts, or annuities.\"\n\nHere's more detail on which were the most popular stocks and funds with HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLegal & General Group (LGEN.L)\n\nFinancial services company Legal & General Group was one name on the list, despite its shares trading nearly 8% in the red on a one-year basis.\n\nIn December, the firm said it was planning to return capital to investors and was on track to meet financial targets. L&G said it was on track to deliver mid-single digital growth in operating profit for the 2024 fiscal year, in line with guidance\n\nOperating profit in its half-year results came in at \u00a3920m ($1.14bn), slightly below the \u00a3924m it delivered in the first half of 2023. Profit after tax attributable to shareholders was down 41% to \u00a3223m.\n\nHowever, L&G raised its half-year dividend by 5% to 6p per share. The company's full-year results are due out on 12 March.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(LGEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nAnother big name on the list was BP, though shares in the oil major are down nearly 10% on a one-year basis.\n\nIn October, BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The oil major reported a nearly 30% slump in underlying replacement cost profit to $2.3bn (\u00a31.85bn) in the third quarter. Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric BP uses as its version of net income.\n\nBP attributed the fall in net income in the third quarter to factors such as weaker realised refining margins and a poor oil trading result.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite worse quarterly results, BP announced a share buyback of $1.75bn as part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that is still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\n\nOil prices have been under pressure over concerns about weaker demand and geopolitical tensions, which has pushed brent crude (BZ=F) back below $78 per barrel.\n\nBP's fourth quarter results and its latest dividend announcement are due out on 11 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(BP.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMiner Rio Tinto also made HL's list of the most-bought stocks by ISA millionaires. While the stock is down nearly 12% over the past year, it recently ticked up slightly on reports that it had been in talks with Glencore (GLEN.L) about a potential merger, though discussions were said to no longer be active.\n\nIn its recently released fourth quarter production results, Rio Tinto said its mined copper production was up 13% in 2024 on the previous year.\n\nCEO Jakob Stausholm said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that US president Donald Trump will give the green light to the company's copper mine in Arizona.\n\n\"I do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he said. It comes after a long battle over permits for the mine.\n\nThe Resolution mine would be the biggest copper mine in North America once completed, capable of producing as much as 25% of US copper demand each year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(RIO.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nISA millionaire top funds\n\nFive Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) index funds were among those most bought by HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nThis included the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P000023MW.L), which tracks the performance of the FTSE World \u2013 Technology index.\n\nThe \u00a33.8bn fund is up nearly 38% over the past year, with its top holdings including iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAnother popular fund with ISA millionaires was Jupiter India (0P0000U20R.L), which has delivered a return of 24% over one year. This return was ahead of its target benchmark of the 13% return from the MSCI India index with net dividends re-invested.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nThe biggest sectors the fund is allocated to are financials and healthcare. Its biggest holdings include tobacco manufacturer Godfrey Phillips India (GODFRYPHLP.NS) and private hospital network Fortis Healthcare (FORTIS.NS).\n\nArtemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L), which invests in UK companies, was also named on HL's list. The fund has produced a return of 15% over one year, beating the FTSE All-Share's (0P00000CNT.L) 9.5%.\n\nFinancials also make up the biggest share of sector exposure in this fund, followed by consumer discretionary and staples firms.\n\nTop holdings include Pearson (PSON.L), which provides educational materials and technology, along with private equity investment trust 3i Group (III.L).\n\nRead more:\n\n6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency Five ways to save on the cost of having children\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and favorable conditions for growth. Given Apple's inclusion in this group, it's likely to experience upward pressure on stock prices. However, the context regarding Tesla's slide might introduce some volatility. Overall, the bullish sentiment outweighs potential bearish trends, suggesting a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, considers Apple as a core holding ('quarterback of your portfolio') due to its consistent performance. However, the article also notes that AAPL's stock performance has been flat recently (0.18%) following a significant decline of 14% from recent highs due to analyst downgrades and reports of declining iPhone sales in China. While the article touches on AI trends, it downplays the notion of Apple as a promising AI stock as a core theme. Cramer's comments from September 2024 portray Apple as reliable, while the article highlights more recent negative developments. Given the contradictory information, I am assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise. The negative near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns mentioned in the article may have a more immediate impact than Cramer's longer-term positive view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off driven by a new AI model from DeepSeek, causing concerns about Big Tech's AI spending.  However, a portfolio manager suggests that this might lead to increased compute needs in the medium term, benefiting companies like Nvidia.  The impact on Apple is less direct. While Apple is a major technology company, the news focuses on the implications for AI spending and chip manufacturers specifically. The sell-off's easing suggests a potential rebound in the broader tech sector.  The discussion regarding Apple is indirect, focusing more on the overall landscape. Therefore, the impact on AAPL is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher chance of a price increase mirroring a general market recovery than a decrease stemming from specific concerns for Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news specific to Apple Inc. itself, but it does indicate continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds such as the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust. Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the Big Tech companies, the news does not directly imply a negative impact on Apple's earnings. However, the overall market reaction and concerns about Big Tech's dominance could lead to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Given that the news does not specifically target Apple and that Big Tech earnings have been driving stocks higher, there is a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a cautious stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and the industry's reaction to DeepSeek's breakthrough model suggests a heightened competition in the AI sector. However, this competition may lead to increased innovation and cost-effective solutions, potentially benefiting companies like Apple. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off and President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition could indicate a positive outlook for Apple's stock. Nevertheless, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is indirect, as the primary focus is on OpenAI, DeepSeek, and their respective partnerships and innovations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) could see varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the overall trend points towards a positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and positive trends in 2024, which bodes well for Apple's stock price. Previous predictions reflect a mix of opinions, but many lean towards a positive outlook for Apple based on its strong market presence and the broader tech rebound. Despite some concerns about recent performance and potential volatility from Tesla's decline, the overall sentiment remains largely bullish for Apple due to its influence in key indexes. Thus, I anticipate a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. While Jim Cramer sees it as a reliable 'quarterback' for a portfolio, the recent performance has been lackluster, with a significant drop due to analyst downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales in China. The focus on AI primarily highlights other companies and doesn't position Apple as a leading AI play, although it acknowledges Apple's ranking among AI stocks Cramer mentions. \n\nConsidering previous predictions, there's a general trend towards cautious optimism, but the mixed signals remain. Given the negative short-term factors (downgrades, sales concerns) alongside the longer-term positive sentiment from Cramer, I'm leaning towards a slightly more negative outlook than some previous predictions, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty. However, Cramer's bullish sentiment and Apple's general resilience prevent a drastic bearish prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader tech sector's reaction to DeepSeek's AI advancements and the potential impact on AI spending. While there's concern about overconcentration and reduced spending in the short term, a portfolio manager suggests that increased compute needs might offset this, benefiting companies like Nvidia. Apple's direct involvement is minimal; it's mentioned only as a 'Big Tech' player. The easing of the sell-off indicates a potential market recovery, which could positively affect Apple. However, the news doesn't offer any specific positive or negative catalysts for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a rise, although the reasoning varied significantly.  Given the indirect nature of the news and lack of specific Apple-related information, the probability of a price rise is moderate, reflecting a potential positive market effect, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low reflecting the absence of negative Apple specific news and the easing of the sell-off.  The consensus in previous predictions shows a slight bias towards stock price rising, but with considerable uncertainty..\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc.

Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions also reflect a mixed but generally optimistic outlook, with probabilities leaning towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Previous analyses show a predominantly bullish sentiment for Apple's stock amidst its prestigious placement in major indexes. While there are mixed signals regarding recent flat performance and analyst downgrades, the overall trend in predictions leans towards a price increase due to optimism in the technology sector and Apple's ongoing relevance. I'm estimating a higher probability of upward movement compared to downward.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer, a respected market commentator, considers Apple a cornerstone of any portfolio. He draws an analogy to a successful quarterback, emphasizing its consistent performance. However, the article also highlights recent headwinds, including analyst downgrades due to disappointing iPhone sales in China, leading to overall flat performance recently (0.18%). While the article mentions Apple ranking 4th in AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about, the larger focus is on other enterprise like Oracle, Softbank and OpenAI that could benefit with an announcement of President Trumps $500 billion Stargate project. Given these mixed signals, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect the conflicting information. There is more emphasis on near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns while long-term factors are weighed slightly less.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is largely indirect regarding Apple. While it discusses a tech sell-off related to AI advancements and subsequent recovery, the impact on Apple is not explicitly stated.  The article mentions Apple as a 'Big Tech' company and briefly touches upon the potential for increased compute needs in the AI space which could benefit some tech companies, but the direct effect on AAPL remains unclear. The easing of the sell-off suggests a general positive market trend that could benefit Apple, but there's no specific positive or negative catalyst linked directly to the company in this news.  Considering previous predictions, there is a wide range of opinions, with a slight bias toward a price rise, primarily due to general market sentiment and the absence of negative Apple-specific news. However, the uncertainty surrounding the impact of AI spending changes on Apple warrants a more moderate prediction than some previous ones.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc.

Despite some mixed signals regarding recent performance and concerns about iPhone sales in China, the overall sentiment from prior predictions leans towards a price increase, particularly influenced by the favorable positioning within key market indexes and technology sector recovery. This optimism is supported by multiple predictions indicating a greater likelihood of stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's positive view of Apple, calling it the 'quarterback of your portfolio,' emphasizing its consistent performance. While the article acknowledges Apple's flat recent performance and challenges like analyst downgrades and declining iPhone sales in China, it also highlights Apple's presence among AI stocks. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of cautious optimism and a gradual increase in the probability of price rise. Despite some negative factors, the positive sentiment from Cramer and Apple's overall strength suggest a higher likelihood of price increase than decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is largely indirect regarding Apple's stock performance.

The article mentions Apple as a 'Big Tech' player and indirectly notes the potential for increased compute needs in AI, which could benefit some tech companies but the effect on Apple remains unclear. The easing of the sell-off suggests a positive broader market sentiment, which could indirectly benefit Apple. However, the news lacks any specific positive or negative Apple-related catalysts.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the general market recovery and lack of specific Apple negative news. The uncertainty surrounding the influence of AI spending changes on Apple necessitates a moderate prediction, avoiding extreme probabilities. Considering the overall trend of slightly increasing probabilities of a rise across previous rounds, and the absence of any direct negative news, I'm leaning slightly towards an increase, but maintaining considerable uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios that include global technology funds, with Apple Inc.
