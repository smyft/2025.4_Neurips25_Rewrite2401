(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why DeepSeek has been so unsettling for the stock market in 3 charts\nNews Content: A cheaper, competitive AI model from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) on Monday as it challenged one of the key drivers of the current bull market.\n\nFor the first time in a while, investors had a tangible reason to believe some US tech giants, namely Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), might not grow earnings by as much as initially hoped in the coming year. The team behind DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence model maker, claimed that the technology uses cheaper chips and less data. Investors are concerned this could hurt future AI chip sales for a company like Nvidia as well as bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI.\n\nThe problem for markets is that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years.\n\n\"The key pillar of this bull market is earning estimates moving higher,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \"Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year.\"\n\nAs Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, Big Tech earnings from the giants \u2014 Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 have seen earnings estimates rise more than the rest of the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe (IEUR) index over the past 12 months.\n\nYesterday's more than 3% decline in the Nasdaq and 1.5% drop in the S&P 500 show how the market could react if both the blue (Big Tech earnings estimates) and green lines (the rest of S&P 500 estimates) in Krishna's chart below begin reversing direction.\n\nThe expected scrutiny over tech earnings will come amid a market that Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told Yahoo Finance is ripe for change. Bernstein'scontribution to Yahoo Finance's Chartbook showed how just 29% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024 and 30% outperformed in 2023. This marked the lowest number of outperformers since the late 1990s.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably incorrect that there is a new paradigm in which the 'Magnificent Seven' secularly dominate the market,\" Bernstein said. \"Such extreme, narrow leadership is rare because it goes against capitalism, open markets, and competition.\"\n\n\"We think 2025 [will] be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBernstein's call for broader returns in 2025 matches the takeaway from a chart shared with Yahoo Finance by Nicole Inui, HSBC's head of equity research for the Americas. Inui's chart shows that while Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow more than the other 493 stocks in the index in 2025, the gap is expected to narrow, making the case for a broadening of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Mag 7, while still outpacing the overall index on earnings growth, is expected to be less of an outlier.\"\n\nTo both Bernstein and Inui's credit, that market action played out on Monday. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Nvidia's large losses led to most of the downside action in the overall index.\n\nThis introduces a stark reality for investors. Should Big Tech's dominance wane, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500. But it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Jan. 15, 2025, in New York City.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and favorable conditions for growth. Given Apple's inclusion in this group, it's likely to experience upward pressure on stock prices. However, the context regarding Tesla's slide might introduce some volatility. Overall, the bullish sentiment outweighs potential bearish trends, suggesting a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, considers Apple as a core holding ('quarterback of your portfolio') due to its consistent performance. However, the article also notes that AAPL's stock performance has been flat recently (0.18%) following a significant decline of 14% from recent highs due to analyst downgrades and reports of declining iPhone sales in China. While the article touches on AI trends, it downplays the notion of Apple as a promising AI stock as a core theme. Cramer's comments from September 2024 portray Apple as reliable, while the article highlights more recent negative developments. Given the contradictory information, I am assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise. The negative near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns mentioned in the article may have a more immediate impact than Cramer's longer-term positive view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off driven by a new AI model from DeepSeek, causing concerns about Big Tech's AI spending.  However, a portfolio manager suggests that this might lead to increased compute needs in the medium term, benefiting companies like Nvidia.  The impact on Apple is less direct. While Apple is a major technology company, the news focuses on the implications for AI spending and chip manufacturers specifically. The sell-off's easing suggests a potential rebound in the broader tech sector.  The discussion regarding Apple is indirect, focusing more on the overall landscape. Therefore, the impact on AAPL is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher chance of a price increase mirroring a general market recovery than a decrease stemming from specific concerns for Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news specific to Apple Inc. itself, but it does indicate continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds such as the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust. Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the Big Tech companies, the news does not directly imply a negative impact on Apple's earnings. However, the overall market reaction and concerns about Big Tech's dominance could lead to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Given that the news does not specifically target Apple and that Big Tech earnings have been driving stocks higher, there is a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a cautious stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and the industry's reaction to DeepSeek's breakthrough model suggests a heightened competition in the AI sector. However, this competition may lead to increased innovation and cost-effective solutions, potentially benefiting companies like Apple. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off and President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition could indicate a positive outlook for Apple's stock. Nevertheless, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is indirect, as the primary focus is on OpenAI, DeepSeek, and their respective partnerships and innovations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) could see varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the overall trend points towards a positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and positive trends in 2024, which bodes well for Apple's stock price. Previous predictions reflect a mix of opinions, but many lean towards a positive outlook for Apple based on its strong market presence and the broader tech rebound. Despite some concerns about recent performance and potential volatility from Tesla's decline, the overall sentiment remains largely bullish for Apple due to its influence in key indexes. Thus, I anticipate a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. While Jim Cramer sees it as a reliable 'quarterback' for a portfolio, the recent performance has been lackluster, with a significant drop due to analyst downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales in China. The focus on AI primarily highlights other companies and doesn't position Apple as a leading AI play, although it acknowledges Apple's ranking among AI stocks Cramer mentions. \n\nConsidering previous predictions, there's a general trend towards cautious optimism, but the mixed signals remain. Given the negative short-term factors (downgrades, sales concerns) alongside the longer-term positive sentiment from Cramer, I'm leaning towards a slightly more negative outlook than some previous predictions, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty. However, Cramer's bullish sentiment and Apple's general resilience prevent a drastic bearish prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader tech sector's reaction to DeepSeek's AI advancements and the potential impact on AI spending. While there's concern about overconcentration and reduced spending in the short term, a portfolio manager suggests that increased compute needs might offset this, benefiting companies like Nvidia. Apple's direct involvement is minimal; it's mentioned only as a 'Big Tech' player. The easing of the sell-off indicates a potential market recovery, which could positively affect Apple. However, the news doesn't offer any specific positive or negative catalysts for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a rise, although the reasoning varied significantly.  Given the indirect nature of the news and lack of specific Apple-related information, the probability of a price rise is moderate, reflecting a potential positive market effect, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low reflecting the absence of negative Apple specific news and the easing of the sell-off.  The consensus in previous predictions shows a slight bias towards stock price rising, but with considerable uncertainty..\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news specific to Apple Inc. itself, but it does indicate continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds such as the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust. Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions also reflect a mixed but generally optimistic outlook, with probabilities leaning towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the overall trend points towards a positive sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news identifies Apple as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which suggests strong market sentiment and indicates potential positive influence on its stock price. Previous analyses show a predominantly bullish sentiment for Apple's stock amidst its prestigious placement in major indexes. While there are mixed signals regarding recent flat performance and analyst downgrades, the overall trend in predictions leans towards a price increase due to optimism in the technology sector and Apple's ongoing relevance. I'm estimating a higher probability of upward movement compared to downward.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer, a respected market commentator, considers Apple a cornerstone of any portfolio. He draws an analogy to a successful quarterback, emphasizing its consistent performance. However, the article also highlights recent headwinds, including analyst downgrades due to disappointing iPhone sales in China, leading to overall flat performance recently (0.18%). While the article mentions Apple ranking 4th in AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about, the larger focus is on other enterprise like Oracle, Softbank and OpenAI that could benefit with an announcement of President Trumps $500 billion Stargate project. Given these mixed signals, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect the conflicting information. There is more emphasis on near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns while long-term factors are weighed slightly less.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is largely indirect regarding Apple. While it discusses a tech sell-off related to AI advancements and subsequent recovery, the impact on Apple is not explicitly stated.  The article mentions Apple as a 'Big Tech' company and briefly touches upon the potential for increased compute needs in the AI space which could benefit some tech companies, but the direct effect on AAPL remains unclear. The easing of the sell-off suggests a general positive market trend that could benefit Apple, but there's no specific positive or negative catalyst linked directly to the company in this news.  Considering previous predictions, there is a wide range of opinions, with a slight bias toward a price rise, primarily due to general market sentiment and the absence of negative Apple-specific news. However, the uncertainty surrounding the impact of AI spending changes on Apple warrants a more moderate prediction than some previous ones.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc.

Despite some mixed signals regarding recent performance and concerns about iPhone sales in China, the overall sentiment from prior predictions leans towards a price increase, particularly influenced by the favorable positioning within key market indexes and technology sector recovery. This optimism is supported by multiple predictions indicating a greater likelihood of stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's positive view of Apple, calling it the 'quarterback of your portfolio,' emphasizing its consistent performance. While the article acknowledges Apple's flat recent performance and challenges like analyst downgrades and declining iPhone sales in China, it also highlights Apple's presence among AI stocks. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of cautious optimism and a gradual increase in the probability of price rise. Despite some negative factors, the positive sentiment from Cramer and Apple's overall strength suggest a higher likelihood of price increase than decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is largely indirect regarding Apple's stock performance.  While it discusses a tech sell-off driven by AI advancements and a subsequent market recovery, the impact on Apple is minimal. The article mentions Apple as a 'Big Tech' player and indirectly notes the potential for increased compute needs in AI, which could benefit some tech companies but the effect on Apple remains unclear. The easing of the sell-off suggests a positive broader market sentiment, which could indirectly benefit Apple. However, the news lacks any specific positive or negative Apple-related catalysts.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the general market recovery and lack of specific Apple negative news. The uncertainty surrounding the influence of AI spending changes on Apple necessitates a moderate prediction, avoiding extreme probabilities. Considering the overall trend of slightly increasing probabilities of a rise across previous rounds, and the absence of any direct negative news, I'm leaning slightly towards an increase, but maintaining considerable uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified portfolios that include global technology funds, with Apple Inc.
