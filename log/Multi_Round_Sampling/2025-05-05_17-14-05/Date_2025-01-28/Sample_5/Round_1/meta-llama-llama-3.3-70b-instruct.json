(AAPL)\nNews Headline: OpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov as industry reels from DeepSeek's breakout\nNews Content: OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project.

Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and favorable conditions for growth. Given Apple's inclusion in this group, it's likely to experience upward pressure on stock prices. However, the context regarding Tesla's slide might introduce some volatility. Overall, the bullish sentiment outweighs potential bearish trends, suggesting a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, considers Apple as a core holding ('quarterback of your portfolio') due to its consistent performance. However, the article also notes that AAPL's stock performance has been flat recently (0.18%) following a significant decline of 14% from recent highs due to analyst downgrades and reports of declining iPhone sales in China. While the article touches on AI trends, it downplays the notion of Apple as a promising AI stock as a core theme. Cramer's comments from September 2024 portray Apple as reliable, while the article highlights more recent negative developments. Given the contradictory information, I am assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise. The negative near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns mentioned in the article may have a more immediate impact than Cramer's longer-term positive view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off driven by a new AI model from DeepSeek, causing concerns about Big Tech's AI spending.  However, a portfolio manager suggests that this might lead to increased compute needs in the medium term, benefiting companies like Nvidia.  The impact on Apple is less direct. While Apple is a major technology company, the news focuses on the implications for AI spending and chip manufacturers specifically. The sell-off's easing suggests a potential rebound in the broader tech sector.  The discussion regarding Apple is indirect, focusing more on the overall landscape. Therefore, the impact on AAPL is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher chance of a price increase mirroring a general market recovery than a decrease stemming from specific concerns for Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news specific to Apple Inc. itself, but it does indicate continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds such as the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust. Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the Big Tech companies, the news does not directly imply a negative impact on Apple's earnings. However, the overall market reaction and concerns about Big Tech's dominance could lead to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Given that the news does not specifically target Apple and that Big Tech earnings have been driving stocks higher, there is a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a cautious stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and the industry's reaction to DeepSeek's breakthrough model suggests a heightened competition in the AI sector. However, this competition may lead to increased innovation and cost-effective solutions, potentially benefiting companies like Apple. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off and President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition could indicate a positive outlook for Apple's stock. Nevertheless, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is indirect, as the primary focus is on OpenAI, DeepSeek, and their respective partnerships and innovations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) could see varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the overall trend points towards a positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
