(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and favorable conditions for growth. Given Apple's inclusion in this group, it's likely to experience upward pressure on stock prices. However, the context regarding Tesla's slide might introduce some volatility. Overall, the bullish sentiment outweighs potential bearish trends, suggesting a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, considers Apple as a core holding ('quarterback of your portfolio') due to its consistent performance. However, the article also notes that AAPL's stock performance has been flat recently (0.18%) following a significant decline of 14% from recent highs due to analyst downgrades and reports of declining iPhone sales in China. While the article touches on AI trends, it downplays the notion of Apple as a promising AI stock as a core theme. Cramer's comments from September 2024 portray Apple as reliable, while the article highlights more recent negative developments. Given the contradictory information, I am assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise. The negative near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns mentioned in the article may have a more immediate impact than Cramer's longer-term positive view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off driven by a new AI model from DeepSeek, causing concerns about Big Tech's AI spending.  However, a portfolio manager suggests that this might lead to increased compute needs in the medium term, benefiting companies like Nvidia.  The impact on Apple is less direct. While Apple is a major technology company, the news focuses on the implications for AI spending and chip manufacturers specifically. The sell-off's easing suggests a potential rebound in the broader tech sector.  The discussion regarding Apple is indirect, focusing more on the overall landscape. Therefore, the impact on AAPL is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher chance of a price increase mirroring a general market recovery than a decrease stemming from specific concerns for Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news specific to Apple Inc. itself, but it does indicate continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds such as the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust. Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the Big Tech companies, the news does not directly imply a negative impact on Apple's earnings. However, the overall market reaction and concerns about Big Tech's dominance could lead to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Given that the news does not specifically target Apple and that Big Tech earnings have been driving stocks higher, there is a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a cautious stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and the industry's reaction to DeepSeek's breakthrough model suggests a heightened competition in the AI sector. However, this competition may lead to increased innovation and cost-effective solutions, potentially benefiting companies like Apple. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off and President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition could indicate a positive outlook for Apple's stock. Nevertheless, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is indirect, as the primary focus is on OpenAI, DeepSeek, and their respective partnerships and innovations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) could see varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the overall trend points towards a positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Given the indirect nature of the news and lack of specific Apple-related information, the probability of a price rise is moderate, reflecting a potential positive market effect, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low reflecting the absence of negative Apple specific news and the easing of the sell-off.
