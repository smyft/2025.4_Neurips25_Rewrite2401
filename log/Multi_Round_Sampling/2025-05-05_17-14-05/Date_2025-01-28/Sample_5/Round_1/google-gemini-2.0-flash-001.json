(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline suggests positive performance for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, indicating strong market sentiment and favorable conditions for growth. Given Apple's inclusion in this group, it's likely to experience upward pressure on stock prices. However, the context regarding Tesla's slide might introduce some volatility. Overall, the bullish sentiment outweighs potential bearish trends, suggesting a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, considers Apple as a core holding ('quarterback of your portfolio') due to its consistent performance. However, the article also notes that AAPL's stock performance has been flat recently (0.18%) following a significant decline of 14% from recent highs due to analyst downgrades and reports of declining iPhone sales in China. While the article touches on AI trends, it downplays the notion of Apple as a promising AI stock as a core theme. Cramer's comments from September 2024 portray Apple as reliable, while the article highlights more recent negative developments. Given the contradictory information, I am assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise. The negative near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns mentioned in the article may have a more immediate impact than Cramer's longer-term positive view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off driven by a new AI model from DeepSeek, causing concerns about Big Tech's AI spending.  However, a portfolio manager suggests that this might lead to increased compute needs in the medium term, benefiting companies like Nvidia.  The impact on Apple is less direct. While Apple is a major technology company, the news focuses on the implications for AI spending and chip manufacturers specifically. The sell-off's easing suggests a potential rebound in the broader tech sector.  The discussion regarding Apple is indirect, focusing more on the overall landscape. Therefore, the impact on AAPL is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher chance of a price increase mirroring a general market recovery than a decrease stemming from specific concerns for Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including global technology funds that hold Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a top holding. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news specific to Apple Inc. itself, but it does indicate continued interest in technology stocks like Apple through funds such as the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust. Given the lack of company-specific news and the general positive sentiment towards technology investments among ISA millionaires, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the Big Tech companies, the news does not directly imply a negative impact on Apple's earnings. However, the overall market reaction and concerns about Big Tech's dominance could lead to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Given that the news does not specifically target Apple and that Big Tech earnings have been driving stocks higher, there is a balanced view but slightly leaning towards a cautious stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov and the industry's reaction to DeepSeek's breakthrough model suggests a heightened competition in the AI sector. However, this competition may lead to increased innovation and cost-effective solutions, potentially benefiting companies like Apple. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off and President Trump's call for the industry to stay ahead of the competition could indicate a positive outlook for Apple's stock. Nevertheless, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is indirect, as the primary focus is on OpenAI, DeepSeek, and their respective partnerships and innovations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong. While Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted for potentially benefiting from increased compute needs, broader tech companies including Apple (AAPL) could see varied impacts. Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and less direct negative impact specifically on Apple, the overall trend points towards a positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
