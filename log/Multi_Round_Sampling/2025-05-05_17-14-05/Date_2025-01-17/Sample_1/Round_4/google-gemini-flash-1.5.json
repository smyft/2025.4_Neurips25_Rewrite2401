(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key partner for Apple, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially lead to delays in production and disruptions in supply chains, negatively impacting Apple's ability to meet demand. As a result, the market may react cautiously to this news, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, since Apple has a strong brand and diversified operations, the impact may not be severe, leading to a moderate probability of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple could face penalties if it continues to allow TikTok to be downloaded from its app store, creating a potential downside. However, the article also highlights that an executive order from Trump could delay the enforcement. Furthermore, the article clearly states that the law will trigger the ban on January 19th, provided that TikTok hasn't divested from its parent company. Also, if the sale of TikTok eventually has to occur, because Chinese officials mentioned selling it to Elon Musk, there might actually be a further gain for the company. Based on the combination of these points, the probability of a rise or a fall will come to about the same number.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the ban on TikTok presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the ban itself could negatively impact Apple's app store revenue (through the loss of TikTok downloads and in-app purchases), the news also highlights potential positive scenarios.  The article suggests several possible outcomes, including a sale of TikTok's US operations, a delayed enforcement of the ban, or even a Congressional reversal of the law.  Each of these outcomes could have differing effects on Apple, lessening the negative impact of a straightforward ban.  A sale of TikTok's US operations could even potentially lead to new business opportunities for Apple. The uncertainty surrounding the future of TikTok makes predicting the exact effect on Apple difficult. While a direct negative impact on app store revenue seems likely, the probability is lessened by the various potential mitigating factors.  The potential for longer-term positive impacts from a sale to another US entity also influences the probability estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4. This loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests weakening demand for Apple's products in China, which could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market, increasing the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which is directed by Greta Gerwig. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it's worth noting that Netflix's decision to release a movie theatrically could be seen as a competitive move against other streaming services, including Apple's. But given the lack of direct connection to Apple's business or recent news about Apple, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news as low. The current news does not provide a strong reason for Apple's stock to move significantly in either direction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple stock, with a 10-year investment of $10,000 growing to $92,281, representing a total return of 822.81%. The article also mentions that Apple is set to report its Q1 2025 earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an EPS of $2.35 and quarterly revenue of $124.40 billion. The consensus rating of the company is 'Buy' with a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside from the current stock price. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors may not find Apple stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors may not be interested due to the low dividend yield of 0.43%. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary entity by a specified deadline. This situation may lead to increased traffic on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and potentially others like Reddit and Pinterest. Given the uncertainty around TikTok's high revenue redirection, the market dynamics might shift in favor of these existing competitors, potentially impacting the advertising market. Apple (AAPL) might experience a temporary increase in downloads on alternative applications, particularly if TikTok is removed from the App Store. However, long-term impacts are uncertain. Overall, the news presents both positive (increased app store traffic) and negative (advertising shifts to competitors) factors, but the overall impact seems more negative due to increased competition.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The challenges faced by Foxconn in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China could lead to production delays and disruptions in Apple's supply chain. This may negatively impact Apple's ability to meet demand, especially in an environment where timely product releases are crucial for maintaining sales momentum. Although Apple has a strong brand and diversified operations, the immediate implications of these challenges suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Moreover, confidence in Apple's ability to navigate these operational obstacles may not fully mitigate investor concerns in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the potential ban on TikTok in the US presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). The immediate impact involves the potential removal of TikTok from the app store, impacting Apple's app store revenue negatively. However, the article discusses Trump's potential interventions and possible acquisitions, creating uncertainty. The potential ban could benefit competitors such as Meta, Google (YouTube), etc. This could also mean more ad dollars for Apple's own ad network. Given the significant uncertainty, coupled with varying degrees of predictions from previous rounds, I will lean slightly lower as the overall implications are negative. Considering previously similar predictions, but also factoring in the potential for a positive (though less likely) outcome, I will adjust the probabilities slightly lower than some of the previous predictions. The overall uncertainty warrants probabilities closer to 50-50.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. The most direct impact is the potential penalty for continuing to host TikTok on the App Store. However, the news also presents several mitigating factors.  The possibility of a delayed enforcement via executive order, the ongoing negotiations for a sale of TikTok's US operations (with various potential buyers mentioned), and the potential for Congressional action to overturn or extend the deadline all introduce significant uncertainty. While the immediate risk of penalties exists, the various potential paths forward make a simple negative prediction overly simplistic.  Given the uncertainty and potential for a positive outcome (e.g., a sale not harming Apple, or even potentially creating new business opportunities), the probability of a stock price decline is still somewhat higher, but not drastically so. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most lean toward a slightly higher probability of a price drop. I am also considering that the news is not solely focused on Apple and that the market's reaction may be muted due to these other factors being the primary focus.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4.

Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market, increasing the probability of a stock price decline. Previous predictions also largely favor a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 0.7 or higher probability of a decline. The consensus aligns with the negative implications of the news, suggesting a cautious market reaction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple stock and its potential future earnings, with a consensus rating of 'Buy' and a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside from the current stock price. However, the article also notes that growth-focused investors may not find Apple stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors may not be interested due to the low dividend yield of 0.43%. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which had varying opinions on the impact of different news on Apple's stock price, it seems that the current news does not provide a strong reason for a significant stock price movement. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but not by a large margin.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary entity by a specified deadline.

This is likely to impact Apple's ability to meet demand, particularly during critical product release periods. Although Apple has a robust brand and diversified operations that may mitigate some risks, the immediate implications of disruptions have led to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Given past predictions and the overall market sentiment leaning toward caution, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the potential ban on TikTok in the US presents a multifaceted scenario for Apple. While direct impacts on Apple are limited, there are a number of indirect effects to consider. There is the potential impact on Apple's App Store revenue because hosting TikTok brings Apple money, and Apple might face penalties if it did not remove TikTok from its App Store. Conversely, some models predicted the impact to be relatively mute because the news' main focus is on TikTok, Trump, and ByteDance. There has even been speculation that Apple could even potentially create new business opportunities. Factoring the additional information from prior rounds, I am slightly more confident that Apple's Stock is likely to rise; I have moved the likelihood of the stock rising and falling closer together.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. The most direct impact is the potential penalty for continuing to host TikTok on the App Store if it's not divested.  However, several mitigating factors exist: Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement, ongoing negotiations for a sale of TikTok (with various potential buyers), and the possibility of Congressional action.  The uncertainty is high.  A sale of TikTok's US operations could even be beneficial to Apple, opening up new avenues or partnerships.  While the immediate risk of penalties exists, the numerous potential paths forward make a simple negative prediction inaccurate. The previous predictions are mixed, but most show a slight leaning towards a price drop, reflecting the uncertainty.  I've considered that this news isn't solely focused on Apple, so the market reaction might be muted.  The potential for both positive (delayed enforcement, sale benefiting Apple) and negative (fines for non-compliance) outcomes leads to a probability closer to even chances.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4.

On one hand, Apple could face penalties if it continues to allow TikTok to be downloaded from its app store, creating a potential downside. However, the article also highlights that an executive order from Trump could delay the enforcement or help find a buyer that can keep TikTok operating in the US legally. Also, in the hypothetical TikTok sale scenarios, there may be additional gains for the company. On the either hand, any TikTok ban will push its users to alternative like Instagram and Youtube, which will attract TikTok ad dollars. There are varying degrees of predictions from previous rounds. Given these mixed signals and uncertainties, coupled with Trump's unpredictable statements, it's difficult to predict the overall implications from happening. The probability of price going up and down are almost equal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple.  The most direct impact is the potential penalty for continuing to host TikTok on the App Store if it's not divested by Jan 19th. However, several mitigating factors significantly reduce the likelihood of a substantial negative impact on Apple's stock price. These include the possibility of a Trump executive order delaying enforcement, ongoing negotiations for a sale of TikTok's US operations to various potential buyers (including Elon Musk), and the potential for Congressional action to overturn or extend the deadline.  A sale of TikTok's US operations could even be beneficial for Apple, opening up new avenues or partnerships.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting this uncertainty. While a short-term negative reaction is possible due to the immediate threat of fines, the various potential positive outcomes and the overall indirect nature of the impact on Apple suggest that the probability of a price fall is moderate, and not overwhelmingly likely.
