Wall Street analysts expect the tech giant to post an EPS of $2.35, up from $2.18 in the year-ago period.

If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Apple also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nApple's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%. In comparison, S&P 500 total return for the same period is 228.10%.\n\nSee Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nWhat Could The Next 10 Years Bring?\n\nApple has a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and a price target of $245.17 based on the ratings of 30 analysts. The price target implies more than a 4% upside from the current stock price.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2024, the company announced its Q4 2024 earnings, posting revenues of $94.9 billion, beating analyst estimates of $94.56 billion, as reported by Benzinga.\n\nThe iPhone maker reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share, beating analyst estimates of $1.60 per share. Total revenue was up 6% year over year. Products revenue came in at $69.96 billion, up from $67.18 billion year over year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key partner for Apple, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially lead to delays in production and disruptions in supply chains, negatively impacting Apple's ability to meet demand. As a result, the market may react cautiously to this news, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, since Apple has a strong brand and diversified operations, the impact may not be severe, leading to a moderate probability of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple could face penalties if it continues to allow TikTok to be downloaded from its app store, creating a potential downside. However, the article also highlights that an executive order from Trump could delay the enforcement. Furthermore, the article clearly states that the law will trigger the ban on January 19th, provided that TikTok hasn't divested from its parent company. Also, if the sale of TikTok eventually has to occur, because Chinese officials mentioned selling it to Elon Musk, there might actually be a further gain for the company. Based on the combination of these points, the probability of a rise or a fall will come to about the same number.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the ban on TikTok presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the ban itself could negatively impact Apple's app store revenue (through the loss of TikTok downloads and in-app purchases), the news also highlights potential positive scenarios.  The article suggests several possible outcomes, including a sale of TikTok's US operations, a delayed enforcement of the ban, or even a Congressional reversal of the law.  Each of these outcomes could have differing effects on Apple, lessening the negative impact of a straightforward ban.  A sale of TikTok's US operations could even potentially lead to new business opportunities for Apple. The uncertainty surrounding the future of TikTok makes predicting the exact effect on Apple difficult. While a direct negative impact on app store revenue seems likely, the probability is lessened by the various potential mitigating factors.  The potential for longer-term positive impacts from a sale to another US entity also influences the probability estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4. This loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests weakening demand for Apple's products in China, which could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market, increasing the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which is directed by Greta Gerwig. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it's worth noting that Netflix's decision to release a movie theatrically could be seen as a competitive move against other streaming services, including Apple's. But given the lack of direct connection to Apple's business or recent news about Apple, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news as low. The current news does not provide a strong reason for Apple's stock to move significantly in either direction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple stock, with a 10-year investment of $10,000 growing to $92,281, representing a total return of 822.81%. The article also mentions that Apple is set to report its Q1 2025 earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an EPS of $2.35 and quarterly revenue of $124.40 billion. The consensus rating of the company is 'Buy' with a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside from the current stock price. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors may not find Apple stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors may not be interested due to the low dividend yield of 0.43%. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary entity by a specified deadline. This situation may lead to increased traffic on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and potentially others like Reddit and Pinterest. Given the uncertainty around TikTok's high revenue redirection, the market dynamics might shift in favor of these existing competitors, potentially impacting the advertising market. Apple (AAPL) might experience a temporary increase in downloads on alternative applications, particularly if TikTok is removed from the App Store. However, long-term impacts are uncertain. Overall, the news presents both positive (increased app store traffic) and negative (advertising shifts to competitors) factors, but the overall impact seems more negative due to increased competition.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The challenges faced by Foxconn in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China could lead to production delays and disruptions in Apple's supply chain. This may negatively impact Apple's ability to meet demand, especially in an environment where timely product releases are crucial for maintaining sales momentum. Although Apple has a strong brand and diversified operations, the immediate implications of these challenges suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Moreover, confidence in Apple's ability to navigate these operational obstacles may not fully mitigate investor concerns in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the potential ban on TikTok in the US presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). The immediate impact involves the potential removal of TikTok from the app store, impacting Apple's app store revenue negatively. However, the article discusses Trump's potential interventions and possible acquisitions, creating uncertainty. The potential ban could benefit competitors such as Meta, Google (YouTube), etc. This could also mean more ad dollars for Apple's own ad network. Given the significant uncertainty, coupled with varying degrees of predictions from previous rounds, I will lean slightly lower as the overall implications are negative. Considering previously similar predictions, but also factoring in the potential for a positive (though less likely) outcome, I will adjust the probabilities slightly lower than some of the previous predictions. The overall uncertainty warrants probabilities closer to 50-50.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. The most direct impact is the potential penalty for continuing to host TikTok on the App Store. However, the news also presents several mitigating factors.  The possibility of a delayed enforcement via executive order, the ongoing negotiations for a sale of TikTok's US operations (with various potential buyers mentioned), and the potential for Congressional action to overturn or extend the deadline all introduce significant uncertainty. While the immediate risk of penalties exists, the various potential paths forward make a simple negative prediction overly simplistic.  Given the uncertainty and potential for a positive outcome (e.g., a sale not harming Apple, or even potentially creating new business opportunities), the probability of a stock price decline is still somewhat higher, but not drastically so. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most lean toward a slightly higher probability of a price drop. I am also considering that the news is not solely focused on Apple and that the market's reaction may be muted due to these other factors being the primary focus.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4. This loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests weakening demand for Apple's products in China, which could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market, increasing the probability of a stock price decline. Previous predictions also largely favor a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 0.7 or higher probability of a decline. The consensus aligns with the negative implications of the news, suggesting a cautious market reaction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple stock and its potential future earnings, with a consensus rating of 'Buy' and a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside from the current stock price. However, the article also notes that growth-focused investors may not find Apple stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors may not be interested due to the low dividend yield of 0.43%. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which had varying opinions on the impact of different news on Apple's stock price, it seems that the current news does not provide a strong reason for a significant stock price movement. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but not by a large margin.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary entity by a specified deadline.
