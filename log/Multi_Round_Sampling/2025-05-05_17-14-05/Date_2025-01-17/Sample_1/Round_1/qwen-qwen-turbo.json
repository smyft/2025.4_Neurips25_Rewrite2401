      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok ban: Where will the app's revenue and 170M users go?\nNews Content: The US Supreme Court ruled to uphold the law banning TikTok in the US unless the company sells to a non-adversary by January 19. If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban. Kulkarni suggests that money \"would just follow the waterfall of the market share.\" Related Videos\n\n03:51\n\nCould Trump save TikTok as Supreme Court decision looms?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago 03:13\n\nTikTok ban is 'parallel' to Trump's earlier Huawei concerns\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 05:25\n\nMicrosoft unveils updated CoPilot for enterprise customers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:38\n\nTikTok calls reports of sale to Elon Musk 'pure fiction'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nIn particular, he posits, \"Google and Facebook [are] the biggest market share companies; most likely, advertisers would probably take that money away from TikTok and go back to those two.\"\n\n\"The reality is that Apple and Google will likely remove TikTok from the app store, which means in the next month or so, users are going to be in a limbo, advertisers are going to be in a limbo,\" Kulkarni explains.\n\nAdditionally, Kulkarni suggests Trump could use TikTok as leverage in US-China negotiations.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key partner for Apple, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially lead to delays in production and disruptions in supply chains, negatively impacting Apple's ability to meet demand. As a result, the market may react cautiously to this news, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, since Apple has a strong brand and diversified operations, the impact may not be severe, leading to a moderate probability of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple could face penalties if it continues to allow TikTok to be downloaded from its app store, creating a potential downside. However, the article also highlights that an executive order from Trump could delay the enforcement. Furthermore, the article clearly states that the law will trigger the ban on January 19th, provided that TikTok hasn't divested from its parent company. Also, if the sale of TikTok eventually has to occur, because Chinese officials mentioned selling it to Elon Musk, there might actually be a further gain for the company. Based on the combination of these points, the probability of a rise or a fall will come to about the same number.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the ban on TikTok presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the ban itself could negatively impact Apple's app store revenue (through the loss of TikTok downloads and in-app purchases), the news also highlights potential positive scenarios.  The article suggests several possible outcomes, including a sale of TikTok's US operations, a delayed enforcement of the ban, or even a Congressional reversal of the law.  Each of these outcomes could have differing effects on Apple, lessening the negative impact of a straightforward ban.  A sale of TikTok's US operations could even potentially lead to new business opportunities for Apple. The uncertainty surrounding the future of TikTok makes predicting the exact effect on Apple difficult. While a direct negative impact on app store revenue seems likely, the probability is lessened by the various potential mitigating factors.  The potential for longer-term positive impacts from a sale to another US entity also influences the probability estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4. This loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests weakening demand for Apple's products in China, which could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market, increasing the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which is directed by Greta Gerwig. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it's worth noting that Netflix's decision to release a movie theatrically could be seen as a competitive move against other streaming services, including Apple's. But given the lack of direct connection to Apple's business or recent news about Apple, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news as low. The current news does not provide a strong reason for Apple's stock to move significantly in either direction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple stock, with a 10-year investment of $10,000 growing to $92,281, representing a total return of 822.81%. The article also mentions that Apple is set to report its Q1 2025 earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an EPS of $2.35 and quarterly revenue of $124.40 billion. The consensus rating of the company is 'Buy' with a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside from the current stock price. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors may not find Apple stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors may not be interested due to the low dividend yield of 0.43%. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary entity by a specified deadline. This situation may lead to increased traffic on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and potentially others like Reddit and Pinterest. Given the uncertainty around TikTok's high revenue redirection, the market dynamics might shift in favor of these existing competitors, potentially impacting the advertising market. Apple (AAPL) might experience a temporary increase in downloads on alternative applications, particularly if TikTok is removed from the App Store. However, long-term impacts are uncertain. Overall, the news presents both positive (increased app store traffic) and negative (advertising shifts to competitors) factors, but the overall impact seems more negative due to increased competition.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
