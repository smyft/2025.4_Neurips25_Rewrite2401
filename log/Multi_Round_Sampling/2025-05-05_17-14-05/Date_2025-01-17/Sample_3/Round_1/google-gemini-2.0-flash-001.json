If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Apple also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nApple's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent news regarding the potential ban of TikTok may have broader implications for tech companies like Apple, especially if TikTok's removal leads to user and advertiser shifts to competing platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat. Although Apple's stock price could be negatively impacted by the legal risks associated with the TikTok ban, the overall market may view this development as an opportunity for Apple and Google to enhance their ad revenue from the influx of TikTok's users. However, the uncertainty surrounding user and revenue transitions could also cause investor caution, leading to a higher likelihood of price fall. Therefore, I estimate the probability of a stock price fall to be higher than that of a rise, considering the complexities involved.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance and potential future growth. While the historical data is positive, showcasing significant returns over the past 10 years, it also points out that the stock may not be as attractive to growth-focused or income-focused investors due to a relatively low dividend yield and limited upside potential based on current analyst price targets. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is important, with expectations for growth in EPS and revenue. However, the article doesn't provide a strong catalyst for immediate stock price appreciation, more likely a neutral influence and future growth. Therefore, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price staying relatively stable or increasing modestly than decreasing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding operations in India.  These challenges relate to staffing and importing machinery. While this news is not overwhelmingly positive, it's also not catastrophic.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted for several reasons: 1) Foxconn's challenges are not unique to Apple; many companies face similar logistical hurdles in international expansion. 2) Apple likely has diversification strategies in place, reducing reliance on any single manufacturing partner or location. 3) The overall scale of Apple's operations makes this a relatively small issue in the grand scheme of things.  Therefore, I expect a small probability of a price drop due to investor concern, but it's more likely the market will view this as a minor, short-term issue. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face short-term challenges as it would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially affecting its revenue from app-related services. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple's competitors in the social media space, such as Meta (META), which might see increased advertising dollars redirected from TikTok to platforms like Instagram. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong ecosystem may mitigate any negative impact. Additionally, the uncertainty around potential executive orders or legislative changes adds complexity to the immediate impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three main points: the TikTok ban upheld, Apple's AI news, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant news is that the company is pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to complaints about factual errors. This news is neutral to slightly negative as it indicates a setback in one of Apple's AI initiatives. However, given that AI is a crucial area of focus for Apple and the issue seems to be more about quality control than a major failure, the impact might be limited. The TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple as it might drive users to other platforms, but this is indirect and not strongly connected to Apple's core business performance. Overall, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news seems to be minimal, but if investors perceive AI stumbles as a negative, there could be a slight downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, including delays due to U.S. regulations, labor shortages, and supply chain gaps. As TSMC is a major supplier of chips to Apple, these delays may impact Apple's production and sales. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative effects. Considering the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and production, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's primary assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing difficulties in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This suggests potential disruptions in Apple's supply chain, which could delay production and affect earnings negatively. As a result, investors might become cautious, leading to a probable decline in stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The article highlights both the positive (beating revenue estimates in Q4 2024) and the potentially negative (limited upside potential, modest dividend) aspects of Apple.
