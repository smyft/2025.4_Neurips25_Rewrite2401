(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok ban: Where will the app's revenue and 170M users go?\nNews Content: The US Supreme Court ruled to uphold the law banning TikTok in the US unless the company sells to a non-adversary by January 19. If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban. Kulkarni suggests that money \"would just follow the waterfall of the market share.\" Related Videos\n\n03:51\n\nCould Trump save TikTok as Supreme Court decision looms?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago 03:13\n\nTikTok ban is 'parallel' to Trump's earlier Huawei concerns\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 05:25\n\nMicrosoft unveils updated CoPilot for enterprise customers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:38\n\nTikTok calls reports of sale to Elon Musk 'pure fiction'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nIn particular, he posits, \"Google and Facebook [are] the biggest market share companies; most likely, advertisers would probably take that money away from TikTok and go back to those two.\"\n\n\"The reality is that Apple and Google will likely remove TikTok from the app store, which means in the next month or so, users are going to be in a limbo, advertisers are going to be in a limbo,\" Kulkarni explains.\n\nAdditionally, Kulkarni suggests Trump could use TikTok as leverage in US-China negotiations.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent news regarding the potential ban of TikTok may have broader implications for tech companies like Apple, especially if TikTok's removal leads to user and advertiser shifts to competing platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat. Although Apple's stock price could be negatively impacted by the legal risks associated with the TikTok ban, the overall market may view this development as an opportunity for Apple and Google to enhance their ad revenue from the influx of TikTok's users. However, the uncertainty surrounding user and revenue transitions could also cause investor caution, leading to a higher likelihood of price fall. Therefore, I estimate the probability of a stock price fall to be higher than that of a rise, considering the complexities involved.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance and potential future growth. While the historical data is positive, showcasing significant returns over the past 10 years, it also points out that the stock may not be as attractive to growth-focused or income-focused investors due to a relatively low dividend yield and limited upside potential based on current analyst price targets. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is important, with expectations for growth in EPS and revenue. However, the article doesn't provide a strong catalyst for immediate stock price appreciation, more likely a neutral influence and future growth. Therefore, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price staying relatively stable or increasing modestly than decreasing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding operations in India.  These challenges relate to staffing and importing machinery. While this news is not overwhelmingly positive, it's also not catastrophic.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted for several reasons: 1) Foxconn's challenges are not unique to Apple; many companies face similar logistical hurdles in international expansion. 2) Apple likely has diversification strategies in place, reducing reliance on any single manufacturing partner or location. 3) The overall scale of Apple's operations makes this a relatively small issue in the grand scheme of things.  Therefore, I expect a small probability of a price drop due to investor concern, but it's more likely the market will view this as a minor, short-term issue. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face short-term challenges as it would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially affecting its revenue from app-related services. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple's competitors in the social media space, such as Meta (META), which might see increased advertising dollars redirected from TikTok to platforms like Instagram. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong ecosystem may mitigate any negative impact. Additionally, the uncertainty around potential executive orders or legislative changes adds complexity to the immediate impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three main points: the TikTok ban upheld, Apple's AI news, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant news is that the company is pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to complaints about factual errors. This news is neutral to slightly negative as it indicates a setback in one of Apple's AI initiatives. However, given that AI is a crucial area of focus for Apple and the issue seems to be more about quality control than a major failure, the impact might be limited. The TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple as it might drive users to other platforms, but this is indirect and not strongly connected to Apple's core business performance. Overall, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news seems to be minimal, but if investors perceive AI stumbles as a negative, there could be a slight downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, including delays due to U.S. regulations, labor shortages, and supply chain gaps. As TSMC is a major supplier of chips to Apple, these delays may impact Apple's production and sales. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative effects. Considering the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and production, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's primary assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing difficulties in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This suggests potential disruptions in Apple's supply chain, which could delay production and affect earnings negatively. As a result, investors might become cautious, leading to a probable decline in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The ruling to uphold a TikTok ban introduces uncertainty for Apple, as it may require the removal of the app from its App Store, potentially impacting service revenue. Moreover, significant TikTok users may shift to competing platforms, benefiting companies like Meta and Google, leading to a broader caution among investors regarding the implications for Apple's ad revenue and app-related business. While some analysts have noted that the long-term impact might be mitigated by Apple's diversified revenue streams, the current landscape suggests investor sentiment is skittish. Thus, the probabilities indicate a higher likelihood of stock price decline due to uncertainty and potential negative impact on revenue.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's past performance and provides some forward-looking statements but does not contain any immediate catalysts for stock price movement. While the historical returns are impressive, this is backward-looking. The upcoming earnings report is mentioned, along with analyst expectations, but this is standard information already priced into the stock. The article highlights both the positive (beating revenue estimates in Q4 2024) and the potentially negative (limited upside potential, modest dividend) aspects of Apple. Given the mixed signals and lack of strong catalysts, I believe the immediate impact on the stock will be minimal. Considering past predictions, there's a general consensus leaning towards neutral to slightly positive sentiment which suggest there might be a very slight probability for price rise, but it's more likely to be stable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India is moderately negative for Apple.  While not catastrophic, it suggests potential supply chain disruptions. The impact is likely to be muted due to Apple's diversification and the fact that many companies face similar logistical hurdles. However, the news adds to existing uncertainty around Apple's supply chain, especially considering the previous predictions referencing TSMC's challenges.  The previous predictions show a range of views, with several leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall than a rise.   Given the relatively small direct impact of this specific news item, and the existing negative sentiment reflected in some previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall, but not significantly so.  The probability is unlikely to be dramatically influenced by this one news item alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the TikTok ban could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face short-term challenges as it would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially affecting its revenue from app-related services. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple's competitors in the social media space, such as Meta (META), which might see increased advertising dollars redirected from TikTok to platforms like Instagram. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong ecosystem may mitigate any negative impact. Additionally, the uncertainty around potential executive orders or legislative changes adds complexity to the immediate impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which show a trend of slightly higher probabilities for a stock price fall, I estimate a balanced but cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news headline mentions the TikTok ban upheld, Apple's AI news, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant news is the pause in AI-generated news summaries due to complaints about factual errors and the potential indirect impact of the TikTok ban. The AI news is neutral to slightly negative as it indicates a setback in one of Apple's AI initiatives. However, given that AI is a crucial area of focus for Apple and the issue seems to be more about quality control than a major failure, the impact might be limited. The TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple as it might drive users to other platforms, but this is indirect and not strongly connected to Apple's core business performance. Considering the mixed implications and the overall market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to investor caution and potential short-term challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact Apple's production and sales. However, TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative effects. Considering the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and production, and taking into account the previous predictions which show a trend of slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This suggests potential disruptions in Apple's supply chain, which could delay production and affect earnings negatively. While historical analysis and other news suggest mixed sentiments, the current news directly impacts Apple's manufacturing capabilities and logistics, potentially causing investor caution. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher due to these supply chain disruptions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly as it may lead to the removal of TikTok from the App Store, affecting service revenue. The potential loss of TikTok's user base could also redirect advertising revenue to competing platforms like Meta and Google, increasing investor caution. While there are suggestions that Apple's diversified revenue streams may mitigate some negative impacts, the immediate sentiment appears to lean towards concern regarding revenue impacts linked to this regulatory event. Given that previous predictions reflected a higher probability of a stock price decline, I align my forecast in that direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article focuses on Apple's impressive historical performance and upcoming Q1 2025 earnings. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the expected growth in EPS and revenue suggests a positive outlook. The article also mentions a consensus 'Buy' rating and a price target suggesting a potential 4% upside. However, concerns are raised about Apple's appeal to growth and income-focused investors due to its limited upside potential and modest dividend yield. Considering the positive earnings outlook and analyst sentiment alongside the valid, tempering cautions, the stock is likely to experience a rise. The previous rounds of prediction are mixed but somewhat leaning towards positive, therefore I will predict a slight rise. The most recent headline and article are backward looking, which should impact the prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India presents a mixed bag for Apple. While not a catastrophic event, it signals potential supply chain disruptions.  The impact is likely muted due to Apple's diversification and the fact that many companies face similar logistical hurdles. However, it adds to the overall uncertainty surrounding Apple's supply chain.  Reviewing previous predictions, there's a discernible trend toward a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, influenced by factors beyond this specific news (e.g., TikTok ban implications, TSMC challenges).  This news adds a small increment of negative sentiment, but isn't a significant driver on its own.  The overall negative bias in the prior predictions, combined with this moderately negative news, reinforces that probability of a price drop is slightly higher than a rise.  The lack of access to the premium article's full content hinders a more definitive prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the TikTok ban introduces uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it may require the removal of TikTok from the App Store, potentially impacting Apple's service revenue. While the ban could benefit competitors like Meta (META) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) by redirecting advertising dollars, the immediate impact on Apple is mixed. Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong ecosystem may mitigate some negative effects, but the legal and operational challenges of enforcing the ban could weigh on investor sentiment. Previous predictions show a trend of slightly higher probabilities for a stock price fall, reflecting cautious investor outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban and Apple's AI-generated news summaries pause presents a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. The TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple as it might drive users to other platforms, but this is indirect and not strongly connected to Apple's core business performance. On the other hand, the pause in AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors could be perceived as a minor setback in Apple's AI initiatives. Given the diversified revenue streams of Apple and the strong ecosystem, the negative impact might be limited. However, considering the previous predictions and the trend of slightly higher probabilities for a stock price fall, I estimate a cautious outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact Apple's production and sales. However, TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative effects. Considering the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and production, and taking into account the previous predictions which show a trend of slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising. Additionally, the news about delays and labor shortages may cause investor concern, further contributing to the likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This suggests potential disruptions in Apple's supply chain, which could delay production and affect earnings negatively. Previous predictions from various models show a consistent trend towards a slightly higher probability of stock price falling, mainly due to concerns about supply chain disruptions and potential impacts on production. Although there are neutral assessments pointing towards stability, the current specific news leans towards a more pessimistic outlook due to the immediate operational challenges.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the US Supreme Court's ruling to uphold the TikTok ban introduces considerable uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), especially as it may lead to the removal of TikTok from its App Store, impacting Apple's service revenue. The potential loss of 170 million users could redirect advertising revenue to competing platforms like Meta and Google, raising investor caution. While some analysts highlight Apple's diversified revenue streams as a buffer against this immediate impact, the prevailing sentiment in recent predictions is leaning towards caution and concern over revenue implications, especially given the context of related supply chain challenges faced by Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in response to this news, reflecting investor apprehension.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The current news article primarily focuses on the historical performance of Apple and its potential for future growth, mentioning the upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report. While it showcases significant returns over the past decade, it also acknowledges that the stock may not be as appealing to growth or income-focused investors due to limited upside potential and a modest dividend yield. Analyst ratings suggest a slight upside, but the overall article leans towards a retrospective analysis rather than highlighting immediate catalysts for a stock price surge. Most of the previous rounds predicts more probability for the stock price to fall. However, some are leaning towards a slight increase. It is more likely that the stock price will stay stable. Given the slightly more positive analysis over the historical performance, but combining the negative view given from the other rounds, there is a slightly higher chance that the stock price going up.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India is relatively minor in the context of Apple's overall operations and diversified supply chain. While it introduces some uncertainty and potential for minor short-term production delays, it's unlikely to significantly impact Apple's long-term prospects.  However, the consistent trend in previous predictions leans heavily towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, influenced by factors such as the TikTok ban and concerns about TSMC.  This negative sentiment, combined with the added, albeit minor, negative news about Foxconn, reinforces the likelihood of a price drop.  The limited information available due to the paywall on the full article prevents a more precise analysis. Therefore, I weigh the relatively minor direct impact of this news against the prevailing bearish sentiment from other factors and the iterative predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the TikTok ban introduces uncertainty for Apple Inc.

The TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple as it might drive users to other platforms, but this is indirect and not strongly connected to Apple's core business performance. Considering the mixed implications and the overall market sentiment, as well as trends from previous predictions which show a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate a cautious outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
