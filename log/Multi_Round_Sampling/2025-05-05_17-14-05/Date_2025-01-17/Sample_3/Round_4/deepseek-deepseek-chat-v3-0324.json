(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent news regarding the potential ban of TikTok may have broader implications for tech companies like Apple, especially if TikTok's removal leads to user and advertiser shifts to competing platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat. Although Apple's stock price could be negatively impacted by the legal risks associated with the TikTok ban, the overall market may view this development as an opportunity for Apple and Google to enhance their ad revenue from the influx of TikTok's users. However, the uncertainty surrounding user and revenue transitions could also cause investor caution, leading to a higher likelihood of price fall. Therefore, I estimate the probability of a stock price fall to be higher than that of a rise, considering the complexities involved.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance and potential future growth. While the historical data is positive, showcasing significant returns over the past 10 years, it also points out that the stock may not be as attractive to growth-focused or income-focused investors due to a relatively low dividend yield and limited upside potential based on current analyst price targets. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is important, with expectations for growth in EPS and revenue. However, the article doesn't provide a strong catalyst for immediate stock price appreciation, more likely a neutral influence and future growth. Therefore, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price staying relatively stable or increasing modestly than decreasing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding operations in India.  These challenges relate to staffing and importing machinery. While this news is not overwhelmingly positive, it's also not catastrophic.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted for several reasons: 1) Foxconn's challenges are not unique to Apple; many companies face similar logistical hurdles in international expansion. 2) Apple likely has diversification strategies in place, reducing reliance on any single manufacturing partner or location. 3) The overall scale of Apple's operations makes this a relatively small issue in the grand scheme of things.  Therefore, I expect a small probability of a price drop due to investor concern, but it's more likely the market will view this as a minor, short-term issue. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face short-term challenges as it would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially affecting its revenue from app-related services. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple's competitors in the social media space, such as Meta (META), which might see increased advertising dollars redirected from TikTok to platforms like Instagram. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong ecosystem may mitigate any negative impact. Additionally, the uncertainty around potential executive orders or legislative changes adds complexity to the immediate impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three main points: the TikTok ban upheld, Apple's AI news, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant news is that the company is pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to complaints about factual errors. This news is neutral to slightly negative as it indicates a setback in one of Apple's AI initiatives. However, given that AI is a crucial area of focus for Apple and the issue seems to be more about quality control than a major failure, the impact might be limited. The TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple as it might drive users to other platforms, but this is indirect and not strongly connected to Apple's core business performance. Overall, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news seems to be minimal, but if investors perceive AI stumbles as a negative, there could be a slight downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, including delays due to U.S. regulations, labor shortages, and supply chain gaps. As TSMC is a major supplier of chips to Apple, these delays may impact Apple's production and sales. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative effects. Considering the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and production, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's primary assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing difficulties in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This suggests potential disruptions in Apple's supply chain, which could delay production and affect earnings negatively. As a result, investors might become cautious, leading to a probable decline in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The ruling to uphold a TikTok ban introduces uncertainty for Apple, as it may require the removal of the app from its App Store, potentially impacting service revenue. Moreover, significant TikTok users may shift to competing platforms, benefiting companies like Meta and Google, leading to a broader caution among investors regarding the implications for Apple's ad revenue and app-related business. While some analysts have noted that the long-term impact might be mitigated by Apple's diversified revenue streams, the current landscape suggests investor sentiment is skittish. Thus, the probabilities indicate a higher likelihood of stock price decline due to uncertainty and potential negative impact on revenue.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's past performance and provides some forward-looking statements but does not contain any immediate catalysts for stock price movement. While the historical returns are impressive, this is backward-looking. The upcoming earnings report is mentioned, along with analyst expectations, but this is standard information already priced into the stock. The article highlights both the positive (beating revenue estimates in Q4 2024) and the potentially negative (limited upside potential, modest dividend) aspects of Apple. Given the mixed signals and lack of strong catalysts, I believe the immediate impact on the stock will be minimal. Considering past predictions, there's a general consensus leaning towards neutral to slightly positive sentiment which suggest there might be a very slight probability for price rise, but it's more likely to be stable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India is moderately negative for Apple.  While not catastrophic, it suggests potential supply chain disruptions. The impact is likely to be muted due to Apple's diversification and the fact that many companies face similar logistical hurdles. However, the news adds to existing uncertainty around Apple's supply chain, especially considering the previous predictions referencing TSMC's challenges.  The previous predictions show a range of views, with several leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall than a rise.   Given the relatively small direct impact of this specific news item, and the existing negative sentiment reflected in some previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall, but not significantly so.  The probability is unlikely to be dramatically influenced by this one news item alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the TikTok ban could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face short-term challenges as it would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially affecting its revenue from app-related services. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple's competitors in the social media space, such as Meta (META), which might see increased advertising dollars redirected from TikTok to platforms like Instagram. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong ecosystem may mitigate any negative impact. Additionally, the uncertainty around potential executive orders or legislative changes adds complexity to the immediate impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which show a trend of slightly higher probabilities for a stock price fall, I estimate a balanced but cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news headline mentions the TikTok ban upheld, Apple's AI news, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant news is the pause in AI-generated news summaries due to complaints about factual errors and the potential indirect impact of the TikTok ban. The AI news is neutral to slightly negative as it indicates a setback in one of Apple's AI initiatives. However, given that AI is a crucial area of focus for Apple and the issue seems to be more about quality control than a major failure, the impact might be limited. The TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple as it might drive users to other platforms, but this is indirect and not strongly connected to Apple's core business performance. Considering the mixed implications and the overall market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to investor caution and potential short-term challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact Apple's production and sales. However, TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative effects. Considering the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and production, and taking into account the previous predictions which show a trend of slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This suggests potential disruptions in Apple's supply chain, which could delay production and affect earnings negatively. While historical analysis and other news suggest mixed sentiments, the current news directly impacts Apple's manufacturing capabilities and logistics, potentially causing investor caution. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher due to these supply chain disruptions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly as it may lead to the removal of TikTok from the App Store, affecting service revenue. The potential loss of TikTok's user base could also redirect advertising revenue to competing platforms like Meta and Google, increasing investor caution. While there are suggestions that Apple's diversified revenue streams may mitigate some negative impacts, the immediate sentiment appears to lean towards concern regarding revenue impacts linked to this regulatory event. Given that previous predictions reflected a higher probability of a stock price decline, I align my forecast in that direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article focuses on Apple's impressive historical performance and upcoming Q1 2025 earnings. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the expected growth in EPS and revenue suggests a positive outlook. The article also mentions a consensus 'Buy' rating and a price target suggesting a potential 4% upside. However, concerns are raised about Apple's appeal to growth and income-focused investors due to its limited upside potential and modest dividend yield. Considering the positive earnings outlook and analyst sentiment alongside the valid, tempering cautions, the stock is likely to experience a rise. The previous rounds of prediction are mixed but somewhat leaning towards positive, therefore I will predict a slight rise. The most recent headline and article are backward looking, which should impact the prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India presents a mixed bag for Apple. While not a catastrophic event, it signals potential supply chain disruptions.  The impact is likely muted due to Apple's diversification and the fact that many companies face similar logistical hurdles. However, it adds to the overall uncertainty surrounding Apple's supply chain.  Reviewing previous predictions, there's a discernible trend toward a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, influenced by factors beyond this specific news (e.g., TikTok ban implications, TSMC challenges).  This news adds a small increment of negative sentiment, but isn't a significant driver on its own.  The overall negative bias in the prior predictions, combined with this moderately negative news, reinforces that probability of a price drop is slightly higher than a rise.  The lack of access to the premium article's full content hinders a more definitive prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the TikTok ban introduces uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it may require the removal of TikTok from the App Store, potentially impacting Apple's service revenue. While the ban could benefit competitors like Meta (META) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) by redirecting advertising dollars, the immediate impact on Apple is mixed. Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong ecosystem may mitigate some negative effects, but the legal and operational challenges of enforcing the ban could weigh on investor sentiment. Previous predictions show a trend of slightly higher probabilities for a stock price fall, reflecting cautious investor outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban and Apple's AI-generated news summaries pause presents a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. The TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple as it might drive users to other platforms, but this is indirect and not strongly connected to Apple's core business performance. On the other hand, the pause in AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors could be perceived as a minor setback in Apple's AI initiatives. Given the diversified revenue streams of Apple and the strong ecosystem, the negative impact might be limited. However, considering the previous predictions and the trend of slightly higher probabilities for a stock price fall, I estimate a cautious outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

However, TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative effects. Considering the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and production, and taking into account the previous predictions which show a trend of slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising. Additionally, the news about delays and labor shortages may cause investor concern, further contributing to the likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This suggests potential disruptions in Apple's supply chain, which could delay production and affect earnings negatively. Previous predictions from various models show a consistent trend towards a slightly higher probability of stock price falling, mainly due to concerns about supply chain disruptions and potential impacts on production. Although there are neutral assessments pointing towards stability, the current specific news leans towards a more pessimistic outlook due to the immediate operational challenges.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the US Supreme Court's ruling to uphold the TikTok ban introduces considerable uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), especially as it may lead to the removal of TikTok from its App Store, impacting Apple's service revenue. The potential loss of 170 million users could redirect advertising revenue to competing platforms like Meta and Google, raising investor caution. While some analysts highlight Apple's diversified revenue streams as a buffer against this immediate impact, the prevailing sentiment in recent predictions is leaning towards caution and concern over revenue implications, especially given the context of related supply chain challenges faced by Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in response to this news, reflecting investor apprehension.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The current news article primarily focuses on the historical performance of Apple and its potential for future growth, mentioning the upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report. While it showcases significant returns over the past decade, it also acknowledges that the stock may not be as appealing to growth or income-focused investors due to limited upside potential and a modest dividend yield. Analyst ratings suggest a slight upside, but the overall article leans towards a retrospective analysis rather than highlighting immediate catalysts for a stock price surge. Most of the previous rounds predicts more probability for the stock price to fall. However, some are leaning towards a slight increase. It is more likely that the stock price will stay stable. Given the slightly more positive analysis over the historical performance, but combining the negative view given from the other rounds, there is a slightly higher chance that the stock price going up.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India is relatively minor in the context of Apple's overall operations and diversified supply chain. While it introduces some uncertainty and potential for minor short-term production delays, it's unlikely to significantly impact Apple's long-term prospects.  However, the consistent trend in previous predictions leans heavily towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, influenced by factors such as the TikTok ban and concerns about TSMC.  This negative sentiment, combined with the added, albeit minor, negative news about Foxconn, reinforces the likelihood of a price drop.  The limited information available due to the paywall on the full article prevents a more precise analysis. Therefore, I weigh the relatively minor direct impact of this news against the prevailing bearish sentiment from other factors and the iterative predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the TikTok ban introduces uncertainty for Apple Inc.
