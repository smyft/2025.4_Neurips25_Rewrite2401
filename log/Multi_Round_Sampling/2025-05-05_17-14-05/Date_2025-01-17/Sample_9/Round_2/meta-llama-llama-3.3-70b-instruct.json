For Apple, as a platform provider for TikTok, the ban might lead to loss of app downloads and engagement, but since TikTok's competitors might see a boost, this news could have mixed implications for Apple's stock price. Overall, the competitive pressure and uncertainties surrounding the app's market presence may negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, there is a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: This news article primarily focuses on Nvidia and its AI safety tools. While Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is mentioned, the direct impact on Apple's stock is minimal. The article lacks specific positive or negative catalysts directly affecting Apple. The overall market sentiment related to potential trade regulations under the new administration is a general concern, but it does not provide specific insights into Apple's exposure compared to other companies mentioned like NVDA and TSLA. Therefore, any price movement for Apple would more likely be influenced by broader market trends than this specific news. NVDA's success usually translates to positive sentiment for tech stocks in general, but it's a weak signal for AAPL specifically. Since there are negligible catalysts in the news related to AAPL, AAPL's price movement will be influenced to general market dynamics and not this news specifically. In absence of catalysts, the probability of positive price movement and negative price movement is almost equal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration.  While Nvidia's advancements are positive, the article's relevance to Apple is minimal.  The mention of Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration is purely contextual and doesn't suggest any direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price, either positively or negatively. Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors and not directly attributable to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors could negatively impact investor confidence in the company's AI initiatives, potentially leading to a short-term decline in stock price. However, the impact might be limited as this is a specific issue rather than a fundamental problem with Apple's core business. The TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court does not directly affect Apple, but could have indirect implications for the tech sector. Overall, the negative news about Apple's AI missteps is likely to have a more immediate impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about IMAX securing a Netflix deal for an exclusive 'Narnia' theatrical release has a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is not directly involved in the deal, but the news mentions that rival streamers like Amazon and Apple allowed movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services. This could imply that Apple, which has its own streaming service, may also consider similar theatrical releases in the future. However, there is no direct impact on Apple's business or revenue, and the news does not provide any specific information about Apple's future plans or performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors could potentially have a slight negative impact on the stock price. However, the impact of this news is likely to be limited and short-term, as it does not directly affect the company's core business or financial performance. Additionally, the news about the potential TikTok ban and Intel being a potential acquisition target does not have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Overall, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively balanced, with a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative news about the AI-generated news summaries.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold a ban on TikTok introduces uncertainty in the social media landscape, which could benefit rivals like Meta and YouTube. While this may negatively impact Apple's app store and advertising revenue linked to TikTok, the broader implications for Apple's core business may be mixed. However, the competitive pressures from increased usage of rival platforms could lead to a slight decline in investor confidence in Apple, particularly in the short term. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability for a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Nvidia and its new AI safety tools, with a tangential mention of Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, attending Trump's inauguration. While Tim Cook attending might be seen as a positive sign for Apple's relationship with the government, the main thrust of the news revolves around Nvidia's AI advancements. The impact on Apple is minimal and doesn't provide a strong catalyst for either a price increase or decrease attributed directly to this specific news. Previous models also indicated about the low relevance of this news on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, this news is considered neutral for Apple's stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Nvidia's AI advancements and its CEO's scheduling conflict with the Trump inauguration.  The connection to Apple is tenuous at best. The mention of Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is purely contextual and offers no insight into Apple's financial prospects or performance.  Nvidia's positive news might have a slight positive ripple effect on the broader tech sector, but the impact on Apple is likely minimal and indirect.  Considering the lack of direct relevance, and the prior predictions showing a balanced or slightly negative sentiment toward AAPL, I expect AAPL's stock price to be largely unaffected by this news. Any movement would likely be driven by broader market forces or other news unrelated to this article.  Therefore, the probabilities for a price rise and a price fall are nearly equal, with a slight edge towards no change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline covers three main points: the TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court, Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple (AAPL), the most relevant news is the pause in AI-generated news summaries, which could negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI initiatives, albeit likely in a short-term and limited manner. The TikTok ban does not directly affect Apple, though there could be indirect implications for the tech sector. Given the negative sentiment around Apple's AI misstep and the lack of directly positive news for Apple in this headline, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising. Previous predictions also leaned towards a higher probability of a fall, with most models estimating a 0.5-0.7 probability of a decline. Considering this, the probabilities are adjusted slightly towards a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia'. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly involved in this deal. However, the article mentions that rival streamers like Amazon and Apple allowed movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services. This could imply that Apple, which has its own streaming service, may also consider similar theatrical releases in the future. However, there is no direct impact on Apple's business or revenue, and the news does not provide any specific information about Apple's future plans or performance. Given the lack of direct impact on Apple's business, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors could negatively impact investor confidence in the company's AI initiatives, potentially leading to a short-term decline in stock price. However, the impact might be limited as this is a specific issue rather than a fundamental problem with Apple's core business. The TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court does not directly affect Apple, but could have indirect implications for the tech sector. Considering the previous predictions, most models agree that the news has a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, but the probabilities are relatively balanced. Given the information, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses potential outcomes and legal proceedings regarding TikTok's future in the United States. Apple itself is not directly affected by the outcomes mentioned, but the uncertainty surrounding TikTok could have mixed impacts on its competitors, including Apple. If TikTok is forced to remove its platform or face restrictions, some users may shift to other apps, potentially benefiting platforms like Apple. On the other hand, a prolonged ban could create consumer and market uncertainty, impacting overall sentiment. Overall, while the news is more directly relevant to companies like TikTok and ByteDance, the mixed potential outcomes make it difficult to predict a strong directional impact on Apple's stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
