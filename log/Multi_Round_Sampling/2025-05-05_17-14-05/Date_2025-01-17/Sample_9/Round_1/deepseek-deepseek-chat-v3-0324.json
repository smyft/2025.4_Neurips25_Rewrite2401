A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's ruling to uphold a ban on TikTok introduces uncertainty in the social media landscape, potentially benefiting rivals such as Meta and YouTube, which could capture advertising revenue previously directed to TikTok. For Apple, as a platform provider for TikTok, the ban might lead to loss of app downloads and engagement, but since TikTok's competitors might see a boost, this news could have mixed implications for Apple's stock price. Overall, the competitive pressure and uncertainties surrounding the app's market presence may negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, there is a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: This news article primarily focuses on Nvidia and its AI safety tools. While Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is mentioned, the direct impact on Apple's stock is minimal. The article lacks specific positive or negative catalysts directly affecting Apple. The overall market sentiment related to potential trade regulations under the new administration is a general concern, but it does not provide specific insights into Apple's exposure compared to other companies mentioned like NVDA and TSLA. Therefore, any price movement for Apple would more likely be influenced by broader market trends than this specific news. NVDA's success usually translates to positive sentiment for tech stocks in general, but it's a weak signal for AAPL specifically. Since there are negligible catalysts in the news related to AAPL, AAPL's price movement will be influenced to general market dynamics and not this news specifically. In absence of catalysts, the probability of positive price movement and negative price movement is almost equal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration.  While Nvidia's advancements are positive, the article's relevance to Apple is minimal.  The mention of Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration is purely contextual and doesn't suggest any direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price, either positively or negatively. Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors and not directly attributable to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors could negatively impact investor confidence in the company's AI initiatives, potentially leading to a short-term decline in stock price. However, the impact might be limited as this is a specific issue rather than a fundamental problem with Apple's core business. The TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court does not directly affect Apple, but could have indirect implications for the tech sector. Overall, the negative news about Apple's AI missteps is likely to have a more immediate impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about IMAX securing a Netflix deal for an exclusive 'Narnia' theatrical release has a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is not directly involved in the deal, but the news mentions that rival streamers like Amazon and Apple allowed movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services. This could imply that Apple, which has its own streaming service, may also consider similar theatrical releases in the future. However, there is no direct impact on Apple's business or revenue, and the news does not provide any specific information about Apple's future plans or performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors could potentially have a slight negative impact on the stock price. However, the impact of this news is likely to be limited and short-term, as it does not directly affect the company's core business or financial performance. Additionally, the news about the potential TikTok ban and Intel being a potential acquisition target does not have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Overall, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively balanced, with a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative news about the AI-generated news summaries.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

For Apple (AAPL), the most relevant news is the pause in AI-generated news summaries, which could negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI initiatives, albeit likely in a short-term and limited manner. The TikTok ban does not directly affect Apple, though there could be indirect implications for the tech sector. Given the negative sentiment around Apple's AI misstep and the lack of directly positive news for Apple in this headline, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising. Previous predictions also leaned towards a higher probability of a fall, with most models estimating a 0.5-0.7 probability of a decline. Considering this, the probabilities are adjusted slightly towards a fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"TikTok ban upheld, Apple's AI news, Intel: Market Minute\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
