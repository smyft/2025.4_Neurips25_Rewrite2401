      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Arizona Setbacks: TSMC Struggles With U.S. Regulations While Prioritizing Taiwan's Chip Leadership\nNews Content: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news primarily highlights the struggles of TSMC in expanding its operations in Arizona due to U.S. regulations, which could delay the supply of advanced chips crucial for Apple. As TSMC is a significant supplier for Apple, any delays in chip production may negatively impact Apple's product development and availability, potentially resulting in a decline in investor confidence. While TSMC reassures that the quality matches Taiwan's standards, the challenges in the U.S. raise concerns about supply chain stability. Consequently, there's likely a higher probability of Apple's stock facing downward pressure due to these supply chain concerns, leading to the estimation of a higher probability of stock price fall than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on IMAX (IMAX) and Netflix (NFLX). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a company that, like Amazon, releases movies theatrically prior to streaming, it is not directly impacted by the specific news of the Narnia deal between IMAX and Netflix. Therefore, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. Any movement up or down will mostly depend on overall market sentiment and other Apple-specific news, independent of the IMAX/Netflix deal. So based on this news alone the changes of stock price moving down or up are both 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on IMAX and Netflix's deal for the theatrical release of 'Narnia'.  While the news is positive for IMAX, and mentions Apple as a rival streamer that has released movies theatrically, there's no direct impact on Apple's stock price mentioned or implied in the article. The article highlights Netflix's strategic moves and its success, but these are not directly linked to Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this news is expected to be negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights delays in TSMC's Arizona plant due to U.S. regulatory hurdles and labor shortages, which could impact the supply chain for Apple's chips. While TSMC reassures quality matches Taiwan's, the delays might cause concerns about potential disruptions or slower production for Apple's components. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong market position may mitigate some negative impacts. The news is more directly negative for TSMC, but Apple could face indirect pressure if chip supply constraints emerge.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, highlighting that an investment of $10,000 ten years ago would now be worth $92,281, representing an 822.81% return. The article also mentions that Apple has a consensus rating of 'Buy' with a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside. However, it notes that the expected upside potential may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the modest dividend yield of 0.43% may not appeal to income-focused investors. Given the neutral to slightly positive outlook, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 55% and falling as 45%.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline provided does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but rather discusses Microsoft's investments and challenges in artificial intelligence. However, Apple Inc. is mentioned in the context of experiencing a significant one-day percentage drop and facing concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. The overall tone of the news suggests that tech giants, including Apple, are under scrutiny for their performance and growth prospects. Given this context, the Article's indirect relation to Apple and the mixed outlook on tech stocks, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling based on the general sentiment towards tech stocks and the specific challenges mentioned for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The pause of the AI-generated news alerts by Apple might cause short-term negative sentiment among users and stakeholders, given these features represent the company's entry into innovative technologies. However, Apple often makes iterative updates based on user feedback, so this issue is likely to be resolved, potentially mitigating long-term negative impacts. Moreover, as Apple's core business consists of hardware and high-margin services, which do not seem directly impacted by this situation, the overall effect on the stock could be minimal. Investors' focus on the long-term growth potential of Apple's product ecosystem might overshadow this temporary setback.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
