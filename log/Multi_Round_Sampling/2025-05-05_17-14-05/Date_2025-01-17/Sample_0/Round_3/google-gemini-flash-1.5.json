(AAPL)\nNews Headline: IMAX Secures Netflix Deal for Exclusive 'Narnia' Theatrical Release, Stock Jumps\nNews Content: IMAX Secures Netflix Deal for Exclusive 'Narnia' Theatrical Release, Stock Jumps\n\nOn Friday, IMAX Corp (NYSE:IMAX) announced that it has agreed with Netflix, Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) to debut Oscar-nominated director Greta Gerwig\u2019s forthcoming film \u201cNarnia\u201d exclusively across the IMAX global theater network with a\u00a0two-week\u00a0run beginning Thanksgiving 2026.\n\nIt will premiere on Netflix at Christmas 2026, after months of negotiation between the companies, according to the Variety\u2019s report. IMAX stock gained after the update.\n\nAlso Read: Wipro Q3 Earnings: 24.5% Profit Jump, IT Services Margins Hit 12-Quarter High, Boosts Interim Dividend Payout to 70%\n\nNetflix mostly prefers to have its movies debut on its platform, particularly the more broadly commercial ones.\n\nHowever, in 2022, the streaming giant allowed \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\u201d to run an exclusive one-week over 600 theatres.\n\nRival streamers like Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) allowed movies to be released theatrically before reaching the streaming services.\n\nIn 2018, Netflix shared plans to produce series and film projects based on Lewis\u2019 \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia.\u201d In 2020, Netflix tapped Gerwig. In 2023, Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d marked the year\u2019s biggest blockbuster, grossing nearly $1.5 billion globally.\n\nNetflix also remained focused on sports events, which likely drove 9 million subscriber additions in the holiday quarter, courtesy of the \u201cJake Paul vs. Mike Tyson\u201d boxing match, National Football League games, and the \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Reuters reports.\n\nAfter its password-sharing crackdown, The streaming giant added premium sports content to its platform to attract younger viewers and advertising dollars.\n\nBMO Capital\u2018s Brian Pitz expects Netflix\u2019s advertising-based video-on-demand (AVOD) monthly active users (MAUs) to reach 90 million by 2025, up from 70 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, backed by Squid Game 2 and WWE.\n\nPrice Actions: IMAX stock is up 3.09% at $23.08 at last check Friday.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news primarily highlights the struggles of TSMC in expanding its operations in Arizona due to U.S. regulations, which could delay the supply of advanced chips crucial for Apple. As TSMC is a significant supplier for Apple, any delays in chip production may negatively impact Apple's product development and availability, potentially resulting in a decline in investor confidence. While TSMC reassures that the quality matches Taiwan's standards, the challenges in the U.S. raise concerns about supply chain stability. Consequently, there's likely a higher probability of Apple's stock facing downward pressure due to these supply chain concerns, leading to the estimation of a higher probability of stock price fall than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on IMAX (IMAX) and Netflix (NFLX). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a company that, like Amazon, releases movies theatrically prior to streaming, it is not directly impacted by the specific news of the Narnia deal between IMAX and Netflix. Therefore, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. Any movement up or down will mostly depend on overall market sentiment and other Apple-specific news, independent of the IMAX/Netflix deal. So based on this news alone the changes of stock price moving down or up are both 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on IMAX and Netflix's deal for the theatrical release of 'Narnia'.  While the news is positive for IMAX, and mentions Apple as a rival streamer that has released movies theatrically, there's no direct impact on Apple's stock price mentioned or implied in the article. The article highlights Netflix's strategic moves and its success, but these are not directly linked to Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this news is expected to be negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights delays in TSMC's Arizona plant due to U.S. regulatory hurdles and labor shortages, which could impact the supply chain for Apple's chips. While TSMC reassures quality matches Taiwan's, the delays might cause concerns about potential disruptions or slower production for Apple's components. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong market position may mitigate some negative impacts. The news is more directly negative for TSMC, but Apple could face indirect pressure if chip supply constraints emerge.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, highlighting that an investment of $10,000 ten years ago would now be worth $92,281, representing an 822.81% return. The article also mentions that Apple has a consensus rating of 'Buy' with a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside. However, it notes that the expected upside potential may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the modest dividend yield of 0.43% may not appeal to income-focused investors. Given the neutral to slightly positive outlook, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 55% and falling as 45%.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline provided does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but rather discusses Microsoft's investments and challenges in artificial intelligence. However, Apple Inc. is mentioned in the context of experiencing a significant one-day percentage drop and facing concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. The overall tone of the news suggests that tech giants, including Apple, are under scrutiny for their performance and growth prospects. Given this context, the Article's indirect relation to Apple and the mixed outlook on tech stocks, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling based on the general sentiment towards tech stocks and the specific challenges mentioned for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The pause of the AI-generated news alerts by Apple might cause short-term negative sentiment among users and stakeholders, given these features represent the company's entry into innovative technologies. However, Apple often makes iterative updates based on user feedback, so this issue is likely to be resolved, potentially mitigating long-term negative impacts. Moreover, as Apple's core business consists of hardware and high-margin services, which do not seem directly impacted by this situation, the overall effect on the stock could be minimal. Investors' focus on the long-term growth potential of Apple's product ecosystem might overshadow this temporary setback.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily highlights the struggles of TSMC in expanding its U.S. operations due to regulatory and labor challenges, which may lead to delays in the supply of advanced chips necessary for Apple's products. Given that TSMC is a critical supplier for Apple, these setbacks could create uncertainty regarding Apple\u2019s supply chain stability and product availability, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence. Consequently, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising in light of these challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for exclusive theatrical release of a 'Narnia' film. Apple is mentioned only as a competitor that also releases movies theatrically before putting them on streaming services. The news is positive for IMAX and Netflix but doesn't directly impact Apple's operations or financial outlook. The previous models also generally agree that there will be minimal impact to Apple because it's unrelated to the underlying business of Apple. Taking all of that into consideration, there is no immediate reason to belief whether it would rise or fall beyond overall market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the theatrical release of 'Narnia.'  Apple is mentioned only in passing as a competitor that also releases movies theatrically before streaming. There is no direct impact on Apple's business or financial prospects from this news.  The news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock valuation. Therefore, any movement in Apple's stock price will be driven by other factors, and this news is unlikely to significantly influence it.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions. Given the lack of direct relevance, I'm assigning near-equal probabilities to price increase and decrease, slightly favoring no change based on the minimal impact of this unrelated event.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights TSMC's struggles with U.S. regulations and labor shortages in Arizona, which could delay the supply of advanced chips to Apple. Given TSMC's role as a key supplier for Apple, these delays might negatively impact Apple's supply chain and product timelines, potentially leading to investor concerns. While TSMC reassures quality standards, the operational challenges could create short-term uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to supply chain concerns, and the direct relevance of TSMC's issues to Apple's operations, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses the historical performance of Apple Inc.

Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple pausing its AI-generated news alerts due to inaccuracies. This news has a minor direct impact on Apple's operations but could affect the market perception of the company's AI initiatives. While some stakeholders may view this as a setback in innovation, it is important to consider Apple's strong market position, diversified revenue streams, and past iterations and improvements based on feedback. Additionally, the majority of Apple's business comprises hardware and other services, which are not significantly affected by this issue. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments from cautious to optimistic, suggesting a mixed market reaction. Overall, the long-term impact is expected to be limited.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges faced by TSMC in expanding its Arizona operations due to U.S. regulations and labor shortages. As TSMC is a key supplier for Apple, these delays could lead to uncertainties regarding Apple's supply chain for advanced chips, which may negatively impact Apple's product development and investor confidence. Multiple analyses suggested a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling based on these supply chain concerns, which are directly relevant to Apple's operations. My estimation reflects a cautious stance due to these potential impacts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia.' Apple is only mentioned as a company that also releases movies theatrically before streaming. There is no direct impact on Apple's business or financial prospects from this news. Most previous models also indicate minimal to no impact on Apple's stock due to this news, with probabilities hovering around 0.5 for both rise and fall. Given this lack of direct relevance and the consensus from previous predictions, I'm assigning probabilities reflecting a neutral outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix, mentioning Apple only in passing as a competitor with a similar theatrical release strategy.  There is no direct impact on Apple's business or financial prospects from this news. The news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock valuation. Therefore, any movement in Apple's stock price will primarily be driven by other factors, and this news is unlikely to significantly influence it.  Previous predictions reflect this irrelevance, with most models assigning near-equal probabilities to price increase and decrease, primarily due to other factors at play.  Considering the lack of direct relevance, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to no change in Apple's stock price than to either a rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights TSMC's struggles with U.S. regulations and labor shortages in Arizona, which could delay the supply of advanced chips to Apple.

However, it notes that the expected upside potential may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the modest dividend yield of 0.43% may not appeal to income-focused investors. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report and its recent Q4 2024 earnings, which beat analyst estimates. Considering the neutral to slightly positive outlook and the mixed predictions from previous models, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 52% and falling as 48%.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Microsoft's investments in artificial intelligence and its potential impact on the company's stock price.
