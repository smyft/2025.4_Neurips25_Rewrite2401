(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia Unveils AI Safety Tools to Boost Enterprise Trust; CEO Jensen To Miss Trump Inauguration\nNews Content: Nvidia Unveils AI Safety Tools to Boost Enterprise Trust; CEO Jensen To Miss Trump Inauguration\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is preparing to take charge on Monday.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market for the company, with the overall annual shipments down by 17%. The data shows consistent decreases in sales throughout the year, culminating in a substantial 25% drop in Q4. Given that Huawei and Vivo have overtaken Apple in market share, this likely raises concerns among investors regarding Apple's competitiveness and growth potential in a key region. In light of this negative sales trend, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising as market sentiment may turn pessimistic.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential public relations challenges from removing TikTok from the App Store, as users may be inconvenienced. This could negatively impact Apple's image and potentially discourage some users from remaining in Apple's ecosystem. On the other hand, while it does not directly benefit from advertising revenue in the way Google or Meta would, Apple provides the platform from which other app companies get their downloads. The ban itself does therefore benefit other businesses that are in the Apple ecosystem. Because app downloads benefit Apple's ecosystem, the change in user adoption would be slightly positive. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the ban and the potential negative impact on Apple's relationship with some users and authorities, I expect a net neutral to slightly negative impact on sentiment for Apple. Because the impact is not directly benefiting nor dramatically impacting Apples bottom line, the movement is not expected to be significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information directly impacting the stock price in the short term.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a slightly higher price target ($245.17) than the current price. This suggests a modest potential upside. However, the article also points out that the projected 4% upside may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the low dividend yield is not appealing to income investors.  Overall, the news is mostly retrospective and lacks strong catalysts for immediate significant price movement. The probability of a price rise is influenced by the analyst predictions and past performance, but the lack of substantial new information tempers the expectation of a large price increase. The probability of a price fall is low because the news is generally positive and doesn't include any negative information. Therefore,  it's more likely the stock will experience a modest movement, rather than a sharp rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's announcement of new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration. While the news mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in passing as one of the Big Tech leaders attending the inauguration, there is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business operations or financial performance. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed scenario. On one hand, if TikTok is forced to shut down or be sold, Apple, as a major distributor of the app, might face short-term penalties or complications. On the other hand, the news does not fundamentally alter Apple's business model or long-term prospects. The law primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, rather than Apple directly. However, Apple's role in distributing TikTok through its app store could see a minor hit if TikTok is banned. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be minimal. But considering the indirect impact and potential for market overreaction, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact its production capacity and timelines. As TSMC is a key supplier of chips to Apple, any delays or setbacks in TSMC's production could potentially affect Apple's operations and supply chain. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts. Given the complexity of the situation, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is moderately higher due to potential supply chain disruptions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The reported significant decline in iPhone sales in China, a vital market for Apple, raises concerns among investors regarding the company's competitiveness and future growth potential. The 17% annual decline and a 25% drop in Q4 sales indicate a worrying trend, with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share. This negative news is likely to dampen investor sentiment, leading to an increased probability of the stock price falling. Comparing previous predictions, the overall sentiment has shifted towards a more bearish outlook in response to this concerning information.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its impact on various tech companies, including Apple (AAPL). While Apple doesn't directly benefit from TikTok's ad revenue, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could present both pros and cons. A con is potential user dissatisfaction and regulatory scrutiny. A pro is increased usage of competing platforms available on the App Store. Analyst Kulkarni raises valid points. Considering these counteracting forces and the potential for market overreaction, I anticipate a slightly negative impact. This round of analysis includes other model's analysis to weigh opinions across the models. In general, the models tend to believe this news will have slightly negative effects.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance over the past 10 years, showing substantial returns. This is positive but doesn't offer new information significantly influencing short-term stock price movements.  Analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings are slightly positive, and a consensus \"Buy\" rating suggests a moderate upside potential (around 4%). However, this modest upside may not excite growth investors, and the low dividend yield is unappealing to income investors.  The article also includes information from Q4 2024, showing Apple exceeding revenue and earnings expectations, which is positive.  Overall, the news is largely retrospective and lacks strong catalysts for immediate price changes.  The previous predictions show a wide range of views, reflecting the lack of a clear directional signal from the news itself.  Considering the overall mildly positive outlook, but the absence of significant new drivers, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, reflecting the analyst consensus but acknowledging the limitations of the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's activities and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration, with only a passing mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the Big Tech leaders attending the event. There is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business operations or financial performance in the news. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday' discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL). The law requires companies like Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores if it is not divested. While this news directly impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, Apple's role as a distributor of TikTok could see a minor hit if TikTok is banned. However, this does not fundamentally alter Apple's business model or long-term prospects. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be minimal. But considering the indirect impact and potential for market overreaction, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall than a rise. Based on the analysis of previous predictions and the current news, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising at 0.3 and the probability of it falling at 0.55, reflecting a cautious outlook due to potential complications but overall limited impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact its production capacity and timelines. As TSMC is a key supplier of chips to Apple, any delays or setbacks in TSMC's production could potentially affect Apple's operations and supply chain. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which showed a mix of positive and negative expectations for Apple's stock price, the current news is likely to have a moderately negative impact on Apple's stock price. This is because the delays in TSMC's Arizona plant may lead to supply chain disruptions, which could affect Apple's ability to meet demand for its products. Given the complexity of the situation, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is moderately higher due to potential supply chain disruptions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies' Q3 earnings results, including Apple (AAPL). Apple reported stronger-than-expected revenues with a 6.1% year-over-year growth, exceeding analysts' expectations. Despite no significant catalysts that would cause a dramatic price movement, the earnings results show financial health and stability. Previous rounds of predictions provided varied insights, ranging from negative impacts due to geopolitical issues to positive expectations based on past performance. Currently, the stock is only slightly up, suggesting minor movements due to the recent results. Given these factors, the probability of a substantial rise or fall appears moderate.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The reported decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market, raises substantial concerns for investors about the company's growth potential and competitiveness. The significant drop in sales, especially a 25% decline in Q4, along with losing market share to Huawei and Vivo, is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Previous predictions show a leaning towards a bearish outlook in response to this alarming sales trend. Therefore, it is more reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US. While this doesn't directly impact Apple's revenue, there are indirect effects to consider. First, removing TikTok might slightly inconvenience some Apple users, potentially leading to minor dissatisfaction. Also, the legal risks on Apple raises concern on the removal of a popular app. However it may benefit the usage of other apps. Considering these opposing forces, I predict a slightly negative impact, but not a drastic one. Reviewing previous predictions, the overall sentiment leans towards expecting a slightly negative impact. Some models predicted a minimal to no impact, but the majority suggest a minor fall. I'm weighting the overall negative sentiment slightly more in my prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's strong past performance, highlighting a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information to directly impact the short-term stock price.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a modest price target increase of around 4%. This suggests a slight upside potential. However, the article also notes that this limited upside may not attract growth-focused investors, and the low dividend yield may not appeal to income investors. The Q4 2024 earnings beat analyst expectations, which is positive.  Overall, the news lacks strong catalysts for immediate significant price movement. The previous predictions from other models show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of a clear directional signal from the news itself. Considering the mixed signals and the mostly retrospective nature of the news, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Nvidia's activities, including the unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration.

Apple reported stronger-than-expected revenues with a 6.1% year-over-year growth, exceeding analysts' expectations. Although there were no significant negative impacts like declines in specific markets or geopolitical issues mentioned, the stock is only slightly up by 1.7% since the earnings results. The overall sentiment from past predictions indicates varying degrees of bullish and bearish outlooks based on different pieces of information, such as sales trends, geopolitical risks, and company-specific performance. Taking all this into account, the news suggests that Apple's business remains robust and stable despite minor market reactions.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: Apple's reported decline in iPhone sales in China, a critical market, raises substantial concerns about the company's competitiveness and growth potential. The significant 17% decline in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 indicate troubling trends for investors, especially as competitors like Huawei and Vivo gain market share. This negative sentiment is likely to overshadow any other positive news regarding the company's performance, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications for Apple. While not directly impacting Apple's revenue, the ban creates a mixed bag of potential outcomes. The removal of TikTok from the App Store could lead to user dissatisfaction and potential regulatory scrutiny, presenting a downside risk for Apple. However, it could also benefit alternative platforms within the Apple ecosystem, potentially increasing app downloads and usage. Analyst commentary suggests uncertainty amongst experts, and previous rounds of predictions indicate a leaning towards expecting a slightly negative impact. Others believed this would have a minimal to no impact, so based on aggregate model sentiment, the prediction is calibrated to a slightly negative expectation. I will take into account that there is no significant long term impact on Apple itself.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's impressive 10-year performance, highlighting significant returns from both stock appreciation and dividends. While this is positive, it's retrospective and doesn't offer new information directly impacting the short-term stock price.  Analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings are slightly positive ($2.35 EPS), and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a modest price target of $245.17 suggests a potential 4% upside. However, this is modest and might not excite growth investors, while the low dividend yield is unappealing to income investors.  The Q4 2024 earnings beat analyst expectations, which is positive.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of a clear directional signal from the news itself.  The absence of significant negative news and the slightly positive analyst outlook slightly favors a price rise, but the overall impact is expected to be minimal, likely within a narrow range.  The consistent probability of a stock price fall across the prior models' predictions, despite varied reasoning, suggests a baseline of caution in the market regarding Apple. I weigh this caution with the slightly positive news in this article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's activities, including the unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration.
