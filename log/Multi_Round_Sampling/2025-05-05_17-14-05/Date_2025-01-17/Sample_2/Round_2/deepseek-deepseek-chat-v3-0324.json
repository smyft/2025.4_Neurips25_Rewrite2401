A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market for the company, with the overall annual shipments down by 17%. The data shows consistent decreases in sales throughout the year, culminating in a substantial 25% drop in Q4. Given that Huawei and Vivo have overtaken Apple in market share, this likely raises concerns among investors regarding Apple's competitiveness and growth potential in a key region. In light of this negative sales trend, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising as market sentiment may turn pessimistic.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential public relations challenges from removing TikTok from the App Store, as users may be inconvenienced. This could negatively impact Apple's image and potentially discourage some users from remaining in Apple's ecosystem. On the other hand, while it does not directly benefit from advertising revenue in the way Google or Meta would, Apple provides the platform from which other app companies get their downloads. The ban itself does therefore benefit other businesses that are in the Apple ecosystem. Because app downloads benefit Apple's ecosystem, the change in user adoption would be slightly positive. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the ban and the potential negative impact on Apple's relationship with some users and authorities, I expect a net neutral to slightly negative impact on sentiment for Apple. Because the impact is not directly benefiting nor dramatically impacting Apples bottom line, the movement is not expected to be significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information directly impacting the stock price in the short term.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a slightly higher price target ($245.17) than the current price. This suggests a modest potential upside. However, the article also points out that the projected 4% upside may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the low dividend yield is not appealing to income investors.  Overall, the news is mostly retrospective and lacks strong catalysts for immediate significant price movement. The probability of a price rise is influenced by the analyst predictions and past performance, but the lack of substantial new information tempers the expectation of a large price increase. The probability of a price fall is low because the news is generally positive and doesn't include any negative information. Therefore,  it's more likely the stock will experience a modest movement, rather than a sharp rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's announcement of new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration. While the news mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in passing as one of the Big Tech leaders attending the inauguration, there is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business operations or financial performance. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed scenario. On one hand, if TikTok is forced to shut down or be sold, Apple, as a major distributor of the app, might face short-term penalties or complications. On the other hand, the news does not fundamentally alter Apple's business model or long-term prospects. The law primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, rather than Apple directly. However, Apple's role in distributing TikTok through its app store could see a minor hit if TikTok is banned. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be minimal. But considering the indirect impact and potential for market overreaction, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact its production capacity and timelines. As TSMC is a key supplier of chips to Apple, any delays or setbacks in TSMC's production could potentially affect Apple's operations and supply chain. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts. Given the complexity of the situation, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is moderately higher due to potential supply chain disruptions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The reported significant decline in iPhone sales in China, a vital market for Apple, raises concerns among investors regarding the company's competitiveness and future growth potential. The 17% annual decline and a 25% drop in Q4 sales indicate a worrying trend, with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share. This negative news is likely to dampen investor sentiment, leading to an increased probability of the stock price falling. Comparing previous predictions, the overall sentiment has shifted towards a more bearish outlook in response to this concerning information.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its impact on various tech companies, including Apple (AAPL). While Apple doesn't directly benefit from TikTok's ad revenue, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could present both pros and cons. A con is potential user dissatisfaction and regulatory scrutiny. A pro is increased usage of competing platforms available on the App Store. Analyst Kulkarni raises valid points. Considering these counteracting forces and the potential for market overreaction, I anticipate a slightly negative impact. This round of analysis includes other model's analysis to weigh opinions across the models. In general, the models tend to believe this news will have slightly negative effects.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance over the past 10 years, showing substantial returns. This is positive but doesn't offer new information significantly influencing short-term stock price movements.  Analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings are slightly positive, and a consensus \"Buy\" rating suggests a moderate upside potential (around 4%). However, this modest upside may not excite growth investors, and the low dividend yield is unappealing to income investors.  The article also includes information from Q4 2024, showing Apple exceeding revenue and earnings expectations, which is positive.  Overall, the news is largely retrospective and lacks strong catalysts for immediate price changes.  The previous predictions show a wide range of views, reflecting the lack of a clear directional signal from the news itself.  Considering the overall mildly positive outlook, but the absence of significant new drivers, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, reflecting the analyst consensus but acknowledging the limitations of the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's activities and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration, with only a passing mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the Big Tech leaders attending the event. There is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business operations or financial performance in the news. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday' discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL). The law requires companies like Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores if it is not divested. While this news directly impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, Apple's role as a distributor of TikTok could see a minor hit if TikTok is banned. However, this does not fundamentally alter Apple's business model or long-term prospects. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be minimal. But considering the indirect impact and potential for market overreaction, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall than a rise. Based on the analysis of previous predictions and the current news, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising at 0.3 and the probability of it falling at 0.55, reflecting a cautious outlook due to potential complications but overall limited impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact its production capacity and timelines. As TSMC is a key supplier of chips to Apple, any delays or setbacks in TSMC's production could potentially affect Apple's operations and supply chain. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which showed a mix of positive and negative expectations for Apple's stock price, the current news is likely to have a moderately negative impact on Apple's stock price. This is because the delays in TSMC's Arizona plant may lead to supply chain disruptions, which could affect Apple's ability to meet demand for its products. Given the complexity of the situation, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is moderately higher due to potential supply chain disruptions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies' Q3 earnings results, including Apple (AAPL). Apple reported stronger-than-expected revenues with a 6.1% year-over-year growth, exceeding analysts' expectations. Despite no significant catalysts that would cause a dramatic price movement, the earnings results show financial health and stability. Previous rounds of predictions provided varied insights, ranging from negative impacts due to geopolitical issues to positive expectations based on past performance. Currently, the stock is only slightly up, suggesting minor movements due to the recent results. Given these factors, the probability of a substantial rise or fall appears moderate.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
