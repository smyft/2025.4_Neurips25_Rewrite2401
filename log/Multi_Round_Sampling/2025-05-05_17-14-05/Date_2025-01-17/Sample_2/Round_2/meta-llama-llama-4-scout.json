      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market for the company, with the overall annual shipments down by 17%. The data shows consistent decreases in sales throughout the year, culminating in a substantial 25% drop in Q4. Given that Huawei and Vivo have overtaken Apple in market share, this likely raises concerns among investors regarding Apple's competitiveness and growth potential in a key region. In light of this negative sales trend, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising as market sentiment may turn pessimistic.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential public relations challenges from removing TikTok from the App Store, as users may be inconvenienced. This could negatively impact Apple's image and potentially discourage some users from remaining in Apple's ecosystem. On the other hand, while it does not directly benefit from advertising revenue in the way Google or Meta would, Apple provides the platform from which other app companies get their downloads. The ban itself does therefore benefit other businesses that are in the Apple ecosystem. Because app downloads benefit Apple's ecosystem, the change in user adoption would be slightly positive. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the ban and the potential negative impact on Apple's relationship with some users and authorities, I expect a net neutral to slightly negative impact on sentiment for Apple. Because the impact is not directly benefiting nor dramatically impacting Apples bottom line, the movement is not expected to be significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information directly impacting the stock price in the short term.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a slightly higher price target ($245.17) than the current price. This suggests a modest potential upside. However, the article also points out that the projected 4% upside may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the low dividend yield is not appealing to income investors.  Overall, the news is mostly retrospective and lacks strong catalysts for immediate significant price movement. The probability of a price rise is influenced by the analyst predictions and past performance, but the lack of substantial new information tempers the expectation of a large price increase. The probability of a price fall is low because the news is generally positive and doesn't include any negative information. Therefore,  it's more likely the stock will experience a modest movement, rather than a sharp rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's announcement of new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration. While the news mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in passing as one of the Big Tech leaders attending the inauguration, there is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business operations or financial performance. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed scenario. On one hand, if TikTok is forced to shut down or be sold, Apple, as a major distributor of the app, might face short-term penalties or complications. On the other hand, the news does not fundamentally alter Apple's business model or long-term prospects. The law primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, rather than Apple directly. However, Apple's role in distributing TikTok through its app store could see a minor hit if TikTok is banned. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be minimal. But considering the indirect impact and potential for market overreaction, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact its production capacity and timelines. As TSMC is a key supplier of chips to Apple, any delays or setbacks in TSMC's production could potentially affect Apple's operations and supply chain. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts. Given the complexity of the situation, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is moderately higher due to potential supply chain disruptions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The reported significant decline in iPhone sales in China, a vital market for Apple, raises concerns among investors regarding the company's competitiveness and future growth potential. The 17% annual decline and a 25% drop in Q4 sales indicate a worrying trend, with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share. This negative news is likely to dampen investor sentiment, leading to an increased probability of the stock price falling. Comparing previous predictions, the overall sentiment has shifted towards a more bearish outlook in response to this concerning information.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its impact on various tech companies, including Apple (AAPL). While Apple doesn't directly benefit from TikTok's ad revenue, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could present both pros and cons. A con is potential user dissatisfaction and regulatory scrutiny. A pro is increased usage of competing platforms available on the App Store. Analyst Kulkarni raises valid points. Considering these counteracting forces and the potential for market overreaction, I anticipate a slightly negative impact. This round of analysis includes other model's analysis to weigh opinions across the models. In general, the models tend to believe this news will have slightly negative effects.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance over the past 10 years, showing substantial returns. This is positive but doesn't offer new information significantly influencing short-term stock price movements.  Analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings are slightly positive, and a consensus \"Buy\" rating suggests a moderate upside potential (around 4%). However, this modest upside may not excite growth investors, and the low dividend yield is unappealing to income investors.  The article also includes information from Q4 2024, showing Apple exceeding revenue and earnings expectations, which is positive.  Overall, the news is largely retrospective and lacks strong catalysts for immediate price changes.  The previous predictions show a wide range of views, reflecting the lack of a clear directional signal from the news itself.  Considering the overall mildly positive outlook, but the absence of significant new drivers, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, reflecting the analyst consensus but acknowledging the limitations of the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's activities and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration, with only a passing mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the Big Tech leaders attending the event. There is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business operations or financial performance in the news. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday' discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL). The law requires companies like Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores if it is not divested. While this news directly impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, Apple's role as a distributor of TikTok could see a minor hit if TikTok is banned. However, this does not fundamentally alter Apple's business model or long-term prospects. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be minimal. But considering the indirect impact and potential for market overreaction, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall than a rise. Based on the analysis of previous predictions and the current news, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising at 0.3 and the probability of it falling at 0.55, reflecting a cautious outlook due to potential complications but overall limited impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which showed a mix of positive and negative expectations for Apple's stock price, the current news is likely to have a moderately negative impact on Apple's stock price. This is because the delays in TSMC's Arizona plant may lead to supply chain disruptions, which could affect Apple's ability to meet demand for its products. Given the complexity of the situation, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is moderately higher due to potential supply chain disruptions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies' Q3 earnings results, including Apple (AAPL). Apple reported stronger-than-expected revenues with a 6.1% year-over-year growth, exceeding analysts' expectations. Despite no significant catalysts that would cause a dramatic price movement, the earnings results show financial health and stability. Previous rounds of predictions provided varied insights, ranging from negative impacts due to geopolitical issues to positive expectations based on past performance. Currently, the stock is only slightly up, suggesting minor movements due to the recent results. Given these factors, the probability of a substantial rise or fall appears moderate.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
