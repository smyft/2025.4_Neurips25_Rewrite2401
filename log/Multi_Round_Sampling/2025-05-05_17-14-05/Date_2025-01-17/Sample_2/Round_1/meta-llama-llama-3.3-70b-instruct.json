      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Arizona Setbacks: TSMC Struggles With U.S. Regulations While Prioritizing Taiwan's Chip Leadership\nNews Content: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market for the company, with the overall annual shipments down by 17%. The data shows consistent decreases in sales throughout the year, culminating in a substantial 25% drop in Q4. Given that Huawei and Vivo have overtaken Apple in market share, this likely raises concerns among investors regarding Apple's competitiveness and growth potential in a key region. In light of this negative sales trend, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising as market sentiment may turn pessimistic.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential public relations challenges from removing TikTok from the App Store, as users may be inconvenienced. This could negatively impact Apple's image and potentially discourage some users from remaining in Apple's ecosystem. On the other hand, while it does not directly benefit from advertising revenue in the way Google or Meta would, Apple provides the platform from which other app companies get their downloads. The ban itself does therefore benefit other businesses that are in the Apple ecosystem. Because app downloads benefit Apple's ecosystem, the change in user adoption would be slightly positive. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the ban and the potential negative impact on Apple's relationship with some users and authorities, I expect a net neutral to slightly negative impact on sentiment for Apple. Because the impact is not directly benefiting nor dramatically impacting Apples bottom line, the movement is not expected to be significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information directly impacting the stock price in the short term.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a slightly higher price target ($245.17) than the current price. This suggests a modest potential upside. However, the article also points out that the projected 4% upside may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the low dividend yield is not appealing to income investors.  Overall, the news is mostly retrospective and lacks strong catalysts for immediate significant price movement. The probability of a price rise is influenced by the analyst predictions and past performance, but the lack of substantial new information tempers the expectation of a large price increase. The probability of a price fall is low because the news is generally positive and doesn't include any negative information. Therefore,  it's more likely the stock will experience a modest movement, rather than a sharp rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's announcement of new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration. While the news mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in passing as one of the Big Tech leaders attending the inauguration, there is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business operations or financial performance. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed scenario. On one hand, if TikTok is forced to shut down or be sold, Apple, as a major distributor of the app, might face short-term penalties or complications. On the other hand, the news does not fundamentally alter Apple's business model or long-term prospects. The law primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, rather than Apple directly. However, Apple's role in distributing TikTok through its app store could see a minor hit if TikTok is banned. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be minimal. But considering the indirect impact and potential for market overreaction, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, which may impact its production capacity and timelines. As TSMC is a key supplier of chips to Apple, any delays or setbacks in TSMC's production could potentially affect Apple's operations and supply chain. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts. Given the complexity of the situation, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is moderately higher due to potential supply chain disruptions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
