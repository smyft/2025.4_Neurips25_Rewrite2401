(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about TikTok indicates significant regulatory uncertainty impacting major tech companies like Apple. The uproar regarding a potential shutdown of TikTok, which could lead to Apple's removal of the app from its store and inability to provide updates, suggests a negative sentiment among investors. Although there is a possibility of regulatory changes that could favor TikTok, the immediate impact of the ban could generate concerns about user engagement and revenue streams tied to advertising on the platform. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall for Apple increases due to the negative outlook presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on IMAX (IMAX) and Netflix (NFLX). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a comparator, it's not directly impacted by the Narnia deal. Therefore, the news has minimal immediate impact on Apple's stock. The reference to AAPL releasing movies theatrically before streaming is a neutral data point in this context. Overall, this news would not have an outsized effect up or down on Apple\u2019s stock price. Because the market typically has fluctuations day to day in any context, it's impossible to say there's a 0% change, but in this case, it's more likely that the price will be relatively stable and within its standard range.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok creates uncertainty for Apple.  The news highlights that if the ban goes into effect, Apple will be legally obligated to remove TikTok from its App Store, facing significant penalties for non-compliance.  While there's potential for Trump's intervention to delay or prevent the ban through executive action or legislative changes, this is uncertain and legally risky.  The likelihood of a delay is high, given Trump's statements, but the ultimate outcome is unclear. A delayed ban wouldn't significantly impact Apple's stock, but a full ban could negatively affect Apple's App Store revenue and its image. However, the impact would be relatively small compared to Apple's overall business, and the market likely already anticipates some level of uncertainty surrounding this issue.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is low, but a slight rise is less likely considering the uncertainty of the situation and the potential negative, though small, repercussions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple. On the other hand, the redirection of TikTok's users and revenue to other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat might not directly benefit Apple, but it also doesn't pose a significant threat to Apple's core business. However, given that a significant number of hours spent on TikTok might redirect to YouTube (owned by Google) and other platforms, it might slightly negatively impact Apple's services segment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report states that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a significant decline of 17% in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4. This indicates a loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo. Given the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales is likely to have a negative impact on the company's revenue and profitability. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban introduces significant uncertainty for Apple. As the law restricts Apple and other tech giants from allowing TikTok to operate on their platforms, there is a potential negative impact on Apple's App Store revenue and user engagement. While there is speculation about possible interventions from the incoming administration to delay the ban, the current situation suggests a serious risk. Consequently, investor sentiment may lean towards caution, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, based on the collective analysis of potential short-term pressures and the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of a 'Narnia' film. While Apple is mentioned as a comparator (rival streamer), it isn't directly affected by this deal. The primary beneficiaries are IMAX and Netflix, as evidenced by their stock price increases reported in the article. Apple's inclusion is merely to contextualize the changing release strategies of streaming companies. Given the indirect nature of the impact, the news is unlikely to cause a significant movement in Apple's stock price. However, the overall positive sentiment around streaming companies exploring theatrical releases *could* be perceived as a minor positive, potentially slightly increasing investor confidence in Apple's similar streaming strategies. However, considering the previous predictions from other models are relatively fluctuating from 0.1-0.4 as stock price rising and 0.2-0.8 as stock price falling, and also the main beneficiary of the news is IMAX and Netflix, I consider apple's stock price raising possibility to be a little low but close to 0.5. Considering the impact is indirect, I will put a near similar rates for stock price rising and falling accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban creates uncertainty, but the impact on Apple is indirect and likely minimal in the short term.  While Apple would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, the potential financial impact is relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue. The larger uncertainty lies in President-elect Trump's potential actions to delay or overturn the ban.  A delay would likely have little immediate impact on Apple's stock.  While a complete ban could slightly negatively affect App Store revenue, it's not a catastrophic event for Apple.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a stock price fall, primarily due to the uncertainty and potential for minor negative impacts. However, the market may already be pricing in this uncertainty. Given the indirect nature of the impact, along with the potential for Trump's intervention, a neutral or slightly positive reaction is also possible. The probabilities are adjusted considering the potential for both negative and positive outcomes and incorporate the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, potentially leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors as they can impact revenue and profitability. Given the historical context where similar supply chain issues have negatively affected Apple's stock, the probability of a stock price fall is higher. Previous predictions also largely favor a negative impact, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the stock is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price.

This indicates a loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo. Given the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales is likely to have a negative impact on the company's revenue and profitability. Furthermore, considering the previous predictions from other models, which have consistently indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various factors such as regulatory uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and competition, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will fall due to this news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies in the consumer electronics sector, including Apple (AAPL), with a focus on their Q3 earnings and general stock movements. Overall, Apple reported strong revenue growth of 6.1%, better than expected. While some negative factors such as the potential TikTok ban could impact the stock price, the recent earnings report reflects a positive performance. Comparing the provided previous predictions, there is a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, mainly due to external factors such as regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical issues.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential TikTok ban creates considerable regulatory uncertainty for Apple and its App Store operations. The Supreme Court's decision indicates that Apple is legally required to remove TikTok from its App Store if the ban takes effect. While there is speculation about potential intervention from the incoming administration, the overall sentiment remains negative. Most analyses suggest that investor caution will increase due to the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's viability, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline for Apple. Previous predictions predominantly favor a negative outlook, reinforcing the expectation of higher probabilities for a fall in stock price compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia'. Apple is only mentioned as a competitor in the streaming space. The direct beneficiaries are IMAX and Netflix, as evidenced by their stock price increases. While there might be a slight positive sentiment towards streaming companies exploring theatrical releases, the impact on Apple would be minimal. Considering previous predictions are mixed but slightly leaning towards a price decrease due to other news catalysts revolving around geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain issues, this agreement is not significant enough to shift investor sentiment about Apple significantly. It is more likely neutral for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban creates uncertainty, but the direct impact on Apple is relatively limited.  Apple's revenue from hosting TikTok on the App Store is a small fraction of its overall revenue. The significant uncertainty lies in President-elect Trump's potential actions to delay or overturn the ban. A delay or reversal would likely have minimal impact on Apple's stock.  A complete ban could slightly negatively affect App Store revenue and potentially Apple's image, but this is unlikely to be a major blow to the company's overall financial health.  The market likely already prices in some level of uncertainty surrounding this issue.  The previous predictions show a range, leaning slightly toward a stock price fall due to uncertainty. However, given the indirect nature of the impact and potential for Trump's intervention, the potential for a neutral or slightly positive reaction is also likely, resulting in probabilities more close to an even split.  The overall economic impact of this ruling on the tech industry also needs to be accounted for. The possibility of increased user adoption of alternative platforms could negatively impact Apple to a degree which only time will tell.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. Such supply chain disruptions are likely to negatively impact Apple's production timelines and costs, which could lead to delays in product releases or increased expenses. Historically, similar supply chain issues have negatively affected Apple's stock price. Given the consensus from previous predictions, which largely favor a negative impact, the probability of a stock price fall is higher. Therefore, the stock is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price.

The previous predictions from other models also indicate a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various factors such as regulatory uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and competition. Therefore, based on the analysis of the news and the trend in previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies in the consumer electronics sector, including Apple (AAPL), with a focus on their Q3 earnings and general stock movements.
