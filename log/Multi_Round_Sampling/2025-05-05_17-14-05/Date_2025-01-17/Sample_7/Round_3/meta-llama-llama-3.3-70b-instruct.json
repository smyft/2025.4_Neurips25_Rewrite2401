A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about TikTok indicates significant regulatory uncertainty impacting major tech companies like Apple. The uproar regarding a potential shutdown of TikTok, which could lead to Apple's removal of the app from its store and inability to provide updates, suggests a negative sentiment among investors. Although there is a possibility of regulatory changes that could favor TikTok, the immediate impact of the ban could generate concerns about user engagement and revenue streams tied to advertising on the platform. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall for Apple increases due to the negative outlook presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on IMAX (IMAX) and Netflix (NFLX). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a comparator, it's not directly impacted by the Narnia deal. Therefore, the news has minimal immediate impact on Apple's stock. The reference to AAPL releasing movies theatrically before streaming is a neutral data point in this context. Overall, this news would not have an outsized effect up or down on Apple\u2019s stock price. Because the market typically has fluctuations day to day in any context, it's impossible to say there's a 0% change, but in this case, it's more likely that the price will be relatively stable and within its standard range.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok creates uncertainty for Apple.  The news highlights that if the ban goes into effect, Apple will be legally obligated to remove TikTok from its App Store, facing significant penalties for non-compliance.  While there's potential for Trump's intervention to delay or prevent the ban through executive action or legislative changes, this is uncertain and legally risky.  The likelihood of a delay is high, given Trump's statements, but the ultimate outcome is unclear. A delayed ban wouldn't significantly impact Apple's stock, but a full ban could negatively affect Apple's App Store revenue and its image. However, the impact would be relatively small compared to Apple's overall business, and the market likely already anticipates some level of uncertainty surrounding this issue.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is low, but a slight rise is less likely considering the uncertainty of the situation and the potential negative, though small, repercussions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple. On the other hand, the redirection of TikTok's users and revenue to other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat might not directly benefit Apple, but it also doesn't pose a significant threat to Apple's core business. However, given that a significant number of hours spent on TikTok might redirect to YouTube (owned by Google) and other platforms, it might slightly negatively impact Apple's services segment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report states that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a significant decline of 17% in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4. This indicates a loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo. Given the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales is likely to have a negative impact on the company's revenue and profitability. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban introduces significant uncertainty for Apple. As the law restricts Apple and other tech giants from allowing TikTok to operate on their platforms, there is a potential negative impact on Apple's App Store revenue and user engagement. While there is speculation about possible interventions from the incoming administration to delay the ban, the current situation suggests a serious risk. Consequently, investor sentiment may lean towards caution, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, based on the collective analysis of potential short-term pressures and the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of a 'Narnia' film. While Apple is mentioned as a comparator (rival streamer), it isn't directly affected by this deal. The primary beneficiaries are IMAX and Netflix, as evidenced by their stock price increases reported in the article. Apple's inclusion is merely to contextualize the changing release strategies of streaming companies. Given the indirect nature of the impact, the news is unlikely to cause a significant movement in Apple's stock price. However, the overall positive sentiment around streaming companies exploring theatrical releases *could* be perceived as a minor positive, potentially slightly increasing investor confidence in Apple's similar streaming strategies. However, considering the previous predictions from other models are relatively fluctuating from 0.1-0.4 as stock price rising and 0.2-0.8 as stock price falling, and also the main beneficiary of the news is IMAX and Netflix, I consider apple's stock price raising possibility to be a little low but close to 0.5. Considering the impact is indirect, I will put a near similar rates for stock price rising and falling accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban creates uncertainty, but the impact on Apple is indirect and likely minimal in the short term.  While Apple would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, the potential financial impact is relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue. The larger uncertainty lies in President-elect Trump's potential actions to delay or overturn the ban.  A delay would likely have little immediate impact on Apple's stock.  While a complete ban could slightly negatively affect App Store revenue, it's not a catastrophic event for Apple.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a stock price fall, primarily due to the uncertainty and potential for minor negative impacts. However, the market may already be pricing in this uncertainty. Given the indirect nature of the impact, along with the potential for Trump's intervention, a neutral or slightly positive reaction is also possible. The probabilities are adjusted considering the potential for both negative and positive outcomes and incorporate the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, potentially leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors as they can impact revenue and profitability. Given the historical context where similar supply chain issues have negatively affected Apple's stock, the probability of a stock price fall is higher. Previous predictions also largely favor a negative impact, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the stock is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple. On the other hand, the redirection of TikTok's users and revenue to other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat might not directly benefit Apple, but it also doesn't pose a significant threat to Apple's core business. However, given that a significant number of hours spent on TikTok might redirect to YouTube (owned by Google) and other platforms, it might slightly negatively impact Apple's services segment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report states that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a significant decline of 17% in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4. This indicates a loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo. Given the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales is likely to have a negative impact on the company's revenue and profitability. Furthermore, considering the previous predictions from other models, which have consistently indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various factors such as regulatory uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and competition, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will fall due to this news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies in the consumer electronics sector, including Apple (AAPL), with a focus on their Q3 earnings and general stock movements. Overall, Apple reported strong revenue growth of 6.1%, better than expected. While some negative factors such as the potential TikTok ban could impact the stock price, the recent earnings report reflects a positive performance. Comparing the provided previous predictions, there is a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, mainly due to external factors such as regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical issues.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential TikTok ban creates considerable regulatory uncertainty for Apple and its App Store operations. The Supreme Court's decision indicates that Apple is legally required to remove TikTok from its App Store if the ban takes effect. While there is speculation about potential intervention from the incoming administration, the overall sentiment remains negative. Most analyses suggest that investor caution will increase due to the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's viability, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline for Apple. Previous predictions predominantly favor a negative outlook, reinforcing the expectation of higher probabilities for a fall in stock price compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia'. Apple is only mentioned as a competitor in the streaming space. The direct beneficiaries are IMAX and Netflix, as evidenced by their stock price increases. While there might be a slight positive sentiment towards streaming companies exploring theatrical releases, the impact on Apple would be minimal. Considering previous predictions are mixed but slightly leaning towards a price decrease due to other news catalysts revolving around geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain issues, this agreement is not significant enough to shift investor sentiment about Apple significantly. It is more likely neutral for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban creates uncertainty, but the direct impact on Apple is relatively limited.  Apple's revenue from hosting TikTok on the App Store is a small fraction of its overall revenue. The significant uncertainty lies in President-elect Trump's potential actions to delay or overturn the ban. A delay or reversal would likely have minimal impact on Apple's stock.  A complete ban could slightly negatively affect App Store revenue and potentially Apple's image, but this is unlikely to be a major blow to the company's overall financial health.  The market likely already prices in some level of uncertainty surrounding this issue.  The previous predictions show a range, leaning slightly toward a stock price fall due to uncertainty. However, given the indirect nature of the impact and potential for Trump's intervention, the potential for a neutral or slightly positive reaction is also likely, resulting in probabilities more close to an even split.  The overall economic impact of this ruling on the tech industry also needs to be accounted for. The possibility of increased user adoption of alternative platforms could negatively impact Apple to a degree which only time will tell.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. Such supply chain disruptions are likely to negatively impact Apple's production timelines and costs, which could lead to delays in product releases or increased expenses. Historically, similar supply chain issues have negatively affected Apple's stock price. Given the consensus from previous predictions, which largely favor a negative impact, the probability of a stock price fall is higher. Therefore, the stock is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price.

This loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo is likely to have a negative impact on Apple's revenue and profitability. Considering the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales will likely influence investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous predictions from other models also indicate a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various factors such as regulatory uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and competition. Therefore, based on the analysis of the news and the trend in previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies in the consumer electronics sector, including Apple (AAPL), with a focus on their Q3 earnings and general stock movements.
