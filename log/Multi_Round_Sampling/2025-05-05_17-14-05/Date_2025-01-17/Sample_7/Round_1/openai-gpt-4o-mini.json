(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Jan. 19\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about TikTok indicates significant regulatory uncertainty impacting major tech companies like Apple. The uproar regarding a potential shutdown of TikTok, which could lead to Apple's removal of the app from its store and inability to provide updates, suggests a negative sentiment among investors. Although there is a possibility of regulatory changes that could favor TikTok, the immediate impact of the ban could generate concerns about user engagement and revenue streams tied to advertising on the platform. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall for Apple increases due to the negative outlook presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on IMAX (IMAX) and Netflix (NFLX). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a comparator, it's not directly impacted by the Narnia deal. Therefore, the news has minimal immediate impact on Apple's stock. The reference to AAPL releasing movies theatrically before streaming is a neutral data point in this context. Overall, this news would not have an outsized effect up or down on Apple\u2019s stock price. Because the market typically has fluctuations day to day in any context, it's impossible to say there's a 0% change, but in this case, it's more likely that the price will be relatively stable and within its standard range.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok creates uncertainty for Apple.  The news highlights that if the ban goes into effect, Apple will be legally obligated to remove TikTok from its App Store, facing significant penalties for non-compliance.  While there's potential for Trump's intervention to delay or prevent the ban through executive action or legislative changes, this is uncertain and legally risky.  The likelihood of a delay is high, given Trump's statements, but the ultimate outcome is unclear. A delayed ban wouldn't significantly impact Apple's stock, but a full ban could negatively affect Apple's App Store revenue and its image. However, the impact would be relatively small compared to Apple's overall business, and the market likely already anticipates some level of uncertainty surrounding this issue.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is low, but a slight rise is less likely considering the uncertainty of the situation and the potential negative, though small, repercussions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple. On the other hand, the redirection of TikTok's users and revenue to other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat might not directly benefit Apple, but it also doesn't pose a significant threat to Apple's core business. However, given that a significant number of hours spent on TikTok might redirect to YouTube (owned by Google) and other platforms, it might slightly negatively impact Apple's services segment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report states that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a significant decline of 17% in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4. This indicates a loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo. Given the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales is likely to have a negative impact on the company's revenue and profitability. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
