A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about TikTok indicates significant regulatory uncertainty impacting major tech companies like Apple. The uproar regarding a potential shutdown of TikTok, which could lead to Apple's removal of the app from its store and inability to provide updates, suggests a negative sentiment among investors. Although there is a possibility of regulatory changes that could favor TikTok, the immediate impact of the ban could generate concerns about user engagement and revenue streams tied to advertising on the platform. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall for Apple increases due to the negative outlook presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on IMAX (IMAX) and Netflix (NFLX). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a comparator, it's not directly impacted by the Narnia deal. Therefore, the news has minimal immediate impact on Apple's stock. The reference to AAPL releasing movies theatrically before streaming is a neutral data point in this context. Overall, this news would not have an outsized effect up or down on Apple\u2019s stock price. Because the market typically has fluctuations day to day in any context, it's impossible to say there's a 0% change, but in this case, it's more likely that the price will be relatively stable and within its standard range.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok creates uncertainty for Apple.  The news highlights that if the ban goes into effect, Apple will be legally obligated to remove TikTok from its App Store, facing significant penalties for non-compliance.  While there's potential for Trump's intervention to delay or prevent the ban through executive action or legislative changes, this is uncertain and legally risky.  The likelihood of a delay is high, given Trump's statements, but the ultimate outcome is unclear. A delayed ban wouldn't significantly impact Apple's stock, but a full ban could negatively affect Apple's App Store revenue and its image. However, the impact would be relatively small compared to Apple's overall business, and the market likely already anticipates some level of uncertainty surrounding this issue.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is low, but a slight rise is less likely considering the uncertainty of the situation and the potential negative, though small, repercussions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple. On the other hand, the redirection of TikTok's users and revenue to other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat might not directly benefit Apple, but it also doesn't pose a significant threat to Apple's core business. However, given that a significant number of hours spent on TikTok might redirect to YouTube (owned by Google) and other platforms, it might slightly negatively impact Apple's services segment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report states that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a significant decline of 17% in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4. This indicates a loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo. Given the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales is likely to have a negative impact on the company's revenue and profitability. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
