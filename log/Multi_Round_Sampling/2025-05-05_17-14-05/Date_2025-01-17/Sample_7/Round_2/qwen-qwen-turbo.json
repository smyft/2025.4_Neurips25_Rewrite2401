This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about TikTok indicates significant regulatory uncertainty impacting major tech companies like Apple. The uproar regarding a potential shutdown of TikTok, which could lead to Apple's removal of the app from its store and inability to provide updates, suggests a negative sentiment among investors. Although there is a possibility of regulatory changes that could favor TikTok, the immediate impact of the ban could generate concerns about user engagement and revenue streams tied to advertising on the platform. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall for Apple increases due to the negative outlook presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on IMAX (IMAX) and Netflix (NFLX). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a comparator, it's not directly impacted by the Narnia deal. Therefore, the news has minimal immediate impact on Apple's stock. The reference to AAPL releasing movies theatrically before streaming is a neutral data point in this context. Overall, this news would not have an outsized effect up or down on Apple\u2019s stock price. Because the market typically has fluctuations day to day in any context, it's impossible to say there's a 0% change, but in this case, it's more likely that the price will be relatively stable and within its standard range.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok creates uncertainty for Apple.  The news highlights that if the ban goes into effect, Apple will be legally obligated to remove TikTok from its App Store, facing significant penalties for non-compliance.  While there's potential for Trump's intervention to delay or prevent the ban through executive action or legislative changes, this is uncertain and legally risky.  The likelihood of a delay is high, given Trump's statements, but the ultimate outcome is unclear. A delayed ban wouldn't significantly impact Apple's stock, but a full ban could negatively affect Apple's App Store revenue and its image. However, the impact would be relatively small compared to Apple's overall business, and the market likely already anticipates some level of uncertainty surrounding this issue.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is low, but a slight rise is less likely considering the uncertainty of the situation and the potential negative, though small, repercussions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple. On the other hand, the redirection of TikTok's users and revenue to other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat might not directly benefit Apple, but it also doesn't pose a significant threat to Apple's core business. However, given that a significant number of hours spent on TikTok might redirect to YouTube (owned by Google) and other platforms, it might slightly negatively impact Apple's services segment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report states that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a significant decline of 17% in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4. This indicates a loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo. Given the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales is likely to have a negative impact on the company's revenue and profitability. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban introduces significant uncertainty for Apple. As the law restricts Apple and other tech giants from allowing TikTok to operate on their platforms, there is a potential negative impact on Apple's App Store revenue and user engagement. While there is speculation about possible interventions from the incoming administration to delay the ban, the current situation suggests a serious risk. Consequently, investor sentiment may lean towards caution, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, based on the collective analysis of potential short-term pressures and the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of a 'Narnia' film. While Apple is mentioned as a comparator (rival streamer), it isn't directly affected by this deal. The primary beneficiaries are IMAX and Netflix, as evidenced by their stock price increases reported in the article. Apple's inclusion is merely to contextualize the changing release strategies of streaming companies. Given the indirect nature of the impact, the news is unlikely to cause a significant movement in Apple's stock price. However, the overall positive sentiment around streaming companies exploring theatrical releases *could* be perceived as a minor positive, potentially slightly increasing investor confidence in Apple's similar streaming strategies. However, considering the previous predictions from other models are relatively fluctuating from 0.1-0.4 as stock price rising and 0.2-0.8 as stock price falling, and also the main beneficiary of the news is IMAX and Netflix, I consider apple's stock price raising possibility to be a little low but close to 0.5. Considering the impact is indirect, I will put a near similar rates for stock price rising and falling accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban creates uncertainty, but the impact on Apple is indirect and likely minimal in the short term.  While Apple would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, the potential financial impact is relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue. The larger uncertainty lies in President-elect Trump's potential actions to delay or overturn the ban.  A delay would likely have little immediate impact on Apple's stock.  While a complete ban could slightly negatively affect App Store revenue, it's not a catastrophic event for Apple.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a stock price fall, primarily due to the uncertainty and potential for minor negative impacts. However, the market may already be pricing in this uncertainty. Given the indirect nature of the impact, along with the potential for Trump's intervention, a neutral or slightly positive reaction is also possible. The probabilities are adjusted considering the potential for both negative and positive outcomes and incorporate the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, potentially leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors as they can impact revenue and profitability. Given the historical context where similar supply chain issues have negatively affected Apple's stock, the probability of a stock price fall is higher. Previous predictions also largely favor a negative impact, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the stock is more likely to fall than rise based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications on the tech industry could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple.

This indicates a loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo. Given the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, this decline in sales is likely to have a negative impact on the company's revenue and profitability. Furthermore, considering the previous predictions from other models, which have consistently indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various factors such as regulatory uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and competition, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will fall due to this news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies in the consumer electronics sector, including Apple (AAPL), with a focus on their Q3 earnings and general stock movements. Overall, Apple reported strong revenue growth of 6.1%, better than expected. While some negative factors such as the potential TikTok ban could impact the stock price, the recent earnings report reflects a positive performance. Comparing the provided previous predictions, there is a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, mainly due to external factors such as regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical issues.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
