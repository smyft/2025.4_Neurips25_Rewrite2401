A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported strong Q3 earnings with revenue growth exceeding expectations, yet it was considered the weakest performer among its peers. The overall sentiment for consumer electronics seems mixed, with some companies experiencing significant stock price increases while others dropped despite beating estimates. Given the market's current volatility and the earlier indications of uncertainty regarding future rate cuts, Apple's slight price increase post-earnings suggests some investor confidence, but the company's relative weakness compared to its peers raises potential concerns. This combination leads to a moderately balanced view on the direction of AAPL's stock price, with a slight lean towards stability rather than a sharp rise or fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: This news article primarily focuses on Nvidia and its AI safety tools. While Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is mentioned, the direct impact on Apple's stock is minimal. The article lacks specific positive or negative catalysts directly affecting Apple. The overall market sentiment related to potential trade regulations under the new administration is a general concern, but it does not provide specific insights into Apple's exposure compared to other companies mentioned like NVDA and TSLA. Therefore, any price movement for Apple would more likely be influenced by broader market trends than this specific news. NVDA's success usually translates to positive sentiment for tech stocks in general, but it's a weak signal for AAPL specifically. Since there are negligible catalysts in the news related to AAPL, AAPL's price movement will be influenced to general market dynamics and not this news specifically. In absence of catalysts, the probability of positive price movement and negative price movement is almost equal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold.  While this is positive sentiment, it's important to note that the article's impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news is not revealing new information about Apple's financial performance or any significant changes in the company's outlook.  The mention of Buffett's holdings reinforces existing investor confidence, but it's unlikely to trigger a large price movement on its own. Many investors already know about Buffett's investment in Apple. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is slightly higher than the probability of a decrease, reflecting a modest positive impact from this endorsement, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market forces.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market for the company, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4. This loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests weakening demand for Apple's products in China, which could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market, increasing the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has caused IMAX stock to jump. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of allowing movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services, similar to Netflix's recent actions. Despite this, there is no direct positive or negative news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the article. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling for AAPL are estimated based on the lack of direct impact from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of the film 'Narnia'. Although the article mentions Apple Inc. as a rival streamer, there is no direct impact on Apple's stock price mentioned in the article. However, considering Apple is a competitor in the streaming industry, a successful deal between Netflix and IMAX might have a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price. Nevertheless, the impact is likely to be minimal, and the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent Q3 earnings report showed a 6.1% year-over-year revenue growth that slightly exceeded analysts' expectations, but the company was noted as the weakest performer among its peers in the consumer electronics sector. Despite a small uptick in stock price of 1.7% following the earnings, concerns about its relative performance might dampen investor sentiment. The overall mixed quarter results for consumer electronics and uncertainty regarding future market conditions (like interest rate cuts) may lead to cautious trading around AAPL. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise appears slightly better than falling but remains limited due to potential concerns. Therefore, I estimate a moderate leaning toward stability with a higher possibility of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Nvidia's AI safety tools and the potential impact of Trump's administration on the semiconductor industry. While Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is noted, this is a neutral event and doesn't directly influence Apple's stock. The mention of potential tariffs on Mexico and China is a general concern for the tech industry but lacks specifics regarding Apple's exposure compared to other companies like Nvidia. Given these factors and taking into account that previous models had very different views, I'll weigh most weight on current news. Since there are negligible catalysts in the news related to AAPL, AAPL's price movement will be influenced to general market dynamics and not this specific news. Considering this information, the probability of positive price movement and negative price movement is almost equal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, suggesting a positive outlook from a renowned investor. However, the article itself doesn't provide any new information about Apple's financials or prospects.  The impact is likely to be minimal, as Buffett's investment is already well-known.  Previous predictions show considerable divergence, with probabilities ranging from a strong likelihood of a price increase to a strong likelihood of a decrease.  This highlights the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement, driven by market-wide factors rather than this specific news.  Averaging the previous predictions, excluding the error, gives a slightly positive bias but acknowledges the considerable uncertainty. The overall sentiment for tech is not definitively positive or negative, so this reinforces the notion that this news alone will have a minimal impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market for the company, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4. This loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo indicates weakening demand for Apple's products in China, which could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market. Previous predictions also reflect a generally negative outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of the film 'Narnia', with a slight positive impact on IMAX stock and a mention of Apple Inc. as a rival streamer. However, there is no direct impact on Apple's stock price mentioned in the article. Considering the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the general trend of mixed sentiments in the tech industry, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling for AAPL are estimated based on the minimal indirect impact from the news. Given the previous predictions, which show a variety of perspectives but generally a balanced view or a slight lean towards negativity due to the competitive nature of the streaming industry, the current prediction takes into account the broad market trends and the indirect mention of Apple in the context of streaming competitors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies within the consumer electronics sector, including Apple (AAPL). Apple reported stronger Q3 revenues with a 6.1% year-on-year increase, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, among its peers, Apple was considered the weakest performer, possibly attributing to slightly lower investor confidence. Given Apple's stock price has only increased by 1.7% since the results, it reflects moderate investor reaction. Combining this with mixed signals from the broader market updates, particularly concerning rate cuts and geopolitical uncertainties, suggests a cautious investor stance. Previous predictions have indicated a somewhat balanced view with a slight pessimism; this analysis aligns closer to the earlier model predictions, albeit with updated considerations.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a 6.1% year-on-year revenue growth, which slightly exceeded analyst expectations. However, Apple was noted as the weakest performer among its peers in the consumer electronics sector, which may dampen investor sentiment despite a stock price increase of 1.7% post-earnings. The overall mixed results within the sector and concerns around future market conditions, including interest rate uncertainty, suggest cautious investor behavior. Given these factors, while there is some positive sentiment, the pressure from relative underperformance and broader market dynamics lead to a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The primary focus of the news is on Nvidia's AI safety tools and CEO's potential absence from Trump's inauguration due to a pre-scheduled trip, with a minor implication that Trump's administration might bring less regulation. Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is mentioned, however this event is neutral in terms of direct impact. Concerns about potential trade regulations, including tariffs on Mexico and China, could create general hesitancy for tech stocks. Considering that the primary news is about Nvidia, and Apple is only glancingly mentioned, the impact of this news on Apple is small. The previous round predictions were mixed, and the current news does not offer clear positive or negative signals specifically related to Apple. Also, there is no evidence that the previous price is significantly affected. Therefore, I am weighing general risk factors and the general market environment when making the decision. I'm leaning slightly toward the downside, considering these factors and uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, which is generally positive. However, the article itself provides no new substantial information about Apple's financial performance or prospects.  The impact of this news is likely to be minimal, as Buffett's investment is already publicly known and factored into the stock price.  Analysis of previous predictions shows significant divergence, ranging from a strong likelihood of a price increase to a strong likelihood of a decrease. This highlights the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement, emphasizing that market-wide factors and other news will outweigh the impact of this particular headline.  Considering the mixed signals from previous rounds, including reports of weaker-than-expected Q3 performance relative to peers and concerns about the Chinese market,  a balanced probability is most appropriate. While the Buffett mention provides a slight positive nudge, it's not strong enough to overcome the existing uncertainties. The lack of specific information in the news itself also supports a more neutral outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market for the company, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4.

Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market. Previous predictions also reflect a generally negative outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news article primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of the film 'Narnia'. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a rival streamer, similar to Netflix, allowing movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services. However, there is no direct impact on Apple's stock price mentioned in the article.

Previous predictions show a variety of perspectives but generally a balanced view or a slight lean towards negativity due to the competitive nature of the streaming industry. Therefore, I estimate a moderate leaning toward stability with a slightly higher possibility of a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Missing probability_of_stock_price_rise\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies within the consumer electronics sector, including Apple (AAPL). Apple reported stronger Q3 revenues with a 6.1% year-on-year increase, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, among its peers, Apple was considered the weakest performer, possibly attributing to slightly lower investor confidence.

Combining this with mixed signals from the broader market updates, particularly concerning rate cuts and geopolitical uncertainties, suggests a cautious investor stance.

However, it was also noted as the weakest performer among its peers in the consumer electronics sector, which may dampen investor sentiment. Despite a slight increase of 1.7% in stock price post-earnings, the uncertain market environment, including rate cuts and mixed signals from the consumer electronics sector, results in cautious trading behavior. Overall, while there are some positive indicators, the concerns regarding relative underperformance and broader market dynamics lead to a slightly higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's AI safety tools and its CEO's expected absence from Trump's inauguration, while mentioning Apple's CEO's attendance. The primary impact is on Nvidia, with potential implications for the broader AI space. Potential tariffs and regulations due to the new presidential administration could affect the tech industry broadly. However, there is no direct positive or negative news related to Apple in this particular article. The mixed sentiment combined with the Nvidia-centric nature of the news leads to a balanced outlook for Apple's stock. The market's reaction to Nvidia's AI tools might indirectly benefit the tech sector, but this effect on Apple appears minimal. Previous models indicated varying opinions, reflecting sector volatility and general economic uncertainties. I'm assigning probabilities close to 50/50, slightly leaning towards a rise, acknowledging the potentially positive overall sentiment in the tech sector because NVDA's up.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, which is generally positive but doesn't offer new substantial information.  Previous predictions show significant divergence, reflecting the influence of broader market factors and other news on Apple's stock price.  There's mention of slightly weaker-than-expected Q3 performance relative to peers and concerns about the Chinese market.  The general sentiment towards Apple, as evidenced by the range of previous predictions, is mixed with a slight negative bias. The fact that this news piece is about Buffett's holdings in general, not specific news about AAPL itself, further minimizes its impact. Therefore, a largely neutral probability is most appropriate, with a slight tilt towards a price decrease reflecting the prevailing uncertainty and relative underperformance concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market for the company, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4.
