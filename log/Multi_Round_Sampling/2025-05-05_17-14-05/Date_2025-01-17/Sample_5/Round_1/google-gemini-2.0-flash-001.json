A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported strong Q3 earnings with revenue growth exceeding expectations, yet it was considered the weakest performer among its peers. The overall sentiment for consumer electronics seems mixed, with some companies experiencing significant stock price increases while others dropped despite beating estimates. Given the market's current volatility and the earlier indications of uncertainty regarding future rate cuts, Apple's slight price increase post-earnings suggests some investor confidence, but the company's relative weakness compared to its peers raises potential concerns. This combination leads to a moderately balanced view on the direction of AAPL's stock price, with a slight lean towards stability rather than a sharp rise or fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: This news article primarily focuses on Nvidia and its AI safety tools. While Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is mentioned, the direct impact on Apple's stock is minimal. The article lacks specific positive or negative catalysts directly affecting Apple. The overall market sentiment related to potential trade regulations under the new administration is a general concern, but it does not provide specific insights into Apple's exposure compared to other companies mentioned like NVDA and TSLA. Therefore, any price movement for Apple would more likely be influenced by broader market trends than this specific news. NVDA's success usually translates to positive sentiment for tech stocks in general, but it's a weak signal for AAPL specifically. Since there are negligible catalysts in the news related to AAPL, AAPL's price movement will be influenced to general market dynamics and not this news specifically. In absence of catalysts, the probability of positive price movement and negative price movement is almost equal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold.  While this is positive sentiment, it's important to note that the article's impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news is not revealing new information about Apple's financial performance or any significant changes in the company's outlook.  The mention of Buffett's holdings reinforces existing investor confidence, but it's unlikely to trigger a large price movement on its own. Many investors already know about Buffett's investment in Apple. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is slightly higher than the probability of a decrease, reflecting a modest positive impact from this endorsement, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market forces.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market for the company, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in Q4. This loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests weakening demand for Apple's products in China, which could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. Given the importance of China to Apple's global sales, this news is likely to be perceived negatively by the market, increasing the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has caused IMAX stock to jump. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of allowing movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services, similar to Netflix's recent actions. Despite this, there is no direct positive or negative news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the article. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling for AAPL are estimated based on the lack of direct impact from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of the film 'Narnia'. Although the article mentions Apple Inc. as a rival streamer, there is no direct impact on Apple's stock price mentioned in the article. However, considering Apple is a competitor in the streaming industry, a successful deal between Netflix and IMAX might have a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price. Nevertheless, the impact is likely to be minimal, and the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
