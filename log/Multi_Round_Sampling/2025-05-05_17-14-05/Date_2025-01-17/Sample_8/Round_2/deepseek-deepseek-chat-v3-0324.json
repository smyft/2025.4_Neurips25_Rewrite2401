A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's decision to pause its AI-generated news alerts over inaccuracy issues reflects a significant setback in its venture into generative AI technology. This could lead to negative perceptions from investors concerning the company's ability to innovate and maintain quality standards. The complaints from news organizations and concerns from press freedom groups may also damage Apple's reputation, potentially affecting user trust and future adoption rates of its AI tools. While this news could have negative implications, Apple remains a strong company with diverse revenue sources, which may mitigate some downward pressure on its stock price. Therefore, there is an estimated 60% probability of the stock price falling and a 40% probability of it rising as investors may still hold confidence in the company\u2019s long-term prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives due to inaccuracies in its news summarization tool. This could negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI advancements in the short term. However, the issue is being addressed with a beta update disabling the feature and plans for future improvements, which mitigates some of the negative impact and indicates a commitment to resolving the problem. The impact seems limited as this relates to a single AI tool and Apple can implement improvements, but negative press might trigger a slight correction. Important to remember this is a Beta. So, the overall long-term strategic goals of the company are not affected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information directly impacting the stock price in the short term.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a slightly higher price target ($245.17) than the current price.  This suggests a modest positive outlook, but the 4% upside potential is not particularly strong.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low, making it less attractive to income investors.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly positive regarding past performance but doesn't offer strong indicators for immediate future price movement. The inclusion of unrelated investment opportunities throughout the article suggests a promotional element rather than pure financial analysis.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is somewhat higher than a decrease, but the effect is likely to be minimal and short-lived based on the information contained only within this specific news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline covers three main points: the TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court, Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple (AAPL), the relevant news is the pause in AI-generated news summaries due to errors. This could be perceived negatively by investors as it highlights potential flaws in Apple's AI initiatives, possibly leading to a short-term decline in investor confidence. However, the impact might be limited as this is not a core revenue-generating segment for Apple. The TikTok ban, while significant, does not directly impact Apple. Intel's news is unrelated to Apple. Given this, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past performance and future expectations. The company's historical success and strong track record have led to significant investor interest. However, the current price target only suggests a small potential upside of 4%, which might not be attractive for growth-focused investors. Additionally, the modest dividend yield of 0.43% may dissuade income-focused investors. Nevertheless, Apple's reputation and market dominance provide a solid foundation for maintaining its stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple pausing its AI-generated news alerts due to inaccuracies raises concerns over the company's ability to maintain high-quality AI products, which could negatively impact investor confidence. This setback in Apple's innovative pursuits, especially given its significant bet on AI technologies, may lead to a perception of stalling or malfunctioning advancements. While some analysts offer a cautious view, highlighting Apple's overall strength in the market and its diverse revenue sources, the immediate reaction is likely negative due to the public nature of the complaints and the suspension of a feature that was intended to enhance user experience. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline compared to a rise, though the strong fundamentals of Apple may moderate the potential downturn.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple pausing its AI-generated news alerts due to inaccuracy issues presents a mixed bag. On one hand, it demonstrates a commitment to quality and accuracy, which is positive for the long run. However, it also highlights potential shortcomings in their AI development, which could temporarily dampen investor enthusiasm. Given that the feature is relatively new and not a major revenue driver, the negative impact is likely to be limited. The previous round shows a trend toward negative sentiment, but I believe this is overly pessimistic. Previous predictions also seem to get sidetracked by unrelated things.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is primarily a retrospective analysis of Apple's stock performance over the past 10 years.  While showcasing impressive returns, this historical data doesn't offer insights into immediate future price movements.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a price target suggesting a modest 4% upside. This is a weak signal, not enough to significantly sway the probability of a price rise.  The low dividend yield further reduces the appeal to income-focused investors.  The article's inclusion of numerous unrelated investment opportunities weakens its analytical value and suggests a promotional intent rather than objective financial analysis. Considering the lack of impactful news directly affecting Apple's short-term prospects and the mixed signals from previous model predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting uncertainty about Apple's near-term trajectory.  Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price rise reflecting the analyst sentiment, but the overall probability of significant movement in either direction remains low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's pause on AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, which could negatively impact investor confidence in the company's AI initiatives. However, this is not a core revenue-generating segment for Apple, and the company's strong fundamentals and diverse revenue streams may mitigate some of the negative impact. The TikTok ban and Intel's potential acquisition are unrelated to Apple and unlikely to affect its stock price. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, which mostly leaned towards a slight negative impact, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's potential for a solid quarter, driven by emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The anticipation of the iPhone 17, with its rumored major redesign, and the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong and contribute to a positive outlook. Additionally, the issues faced by Huawei, such as chip supply problems, might allow Apple to gain market share. With a $250 price target and expectations of steady gross margins, the outlook seems positive. Considering the previous predictions, which showed a mix of sentiments but generally leaned towards a cautious optimism, the current news seems to reinforce the potential for a stock price increase. Thus, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than that of a fall, taking into account the overall positive tone of the news and the potential for future growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past performance and a modest future growth outlook coupled with a low dividend yield. While Apple has demonstrated strong historical performance, the expected 4% price target upside is modest, indicating limited potential for immediate price gains. Additionally, the low dividend yield may limit attractiveness for income-focused investors. These factors combine to suggest a restrained upside potential and modest investor expectations. Other recent models' predictions also tend towards a lower probability of stock price rising. Combining these, the estimated probabilities reflect a scenario with a higher chance of stability or decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
