A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's decision to pause its AI-generated news alerts over inaccuracy issues reflects a significant setback in its venture into generative AI technology. This could lead to negative perceptions from investors concerning the company's ability to innovate and maintain quality standards. The complaints from news organizations and concerns from press freedom groups may also damage Apple's reputation, potentially affecting user trust and future adoption rates of its AI tools. While this news could have negative implications, Apple remains a strong company with diverse revenue sources, which may mitigate some downward pressure on its stock price. Therefore, there is an estimated 60% probability of the stock price falling and a 40% probability of it rising as investors may still hold confidence in the company\u2019s long-term prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives due to inaccuracies in its news summarization tool. This could negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI advancements in the short term. However, the issue is being addressed with a beta update disabling the feature and plans for future improvements, which mitigates some of the negative impact and indicates a commitment to resolving the problem. The impact seems limited as this relates to a single AI tool and Apple can implement improvements, but negative press might trigger a slight correction. Important to remember this is a Beta. So, the overall long-term strategic goals of the company are not affected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information directly impacting the stock price in the short term.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a slightly higher price target ($245.17) than the current price.  This suggests a modest positive outlook, but the 4% upside potential is not particularly strong.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low, making it less attractive to income investors.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly positive regarding past performance but doesn't offer strong indicators for immediate future price movement. The inclusion of unrelated investment opportunities throughout the article suggests a promotional element rather than pure financial analysis.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is somewhat higher than a decrease, but the effect is likely to be minimal and short-lived based on the information contained only within this specific news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline covers three main points: the TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court, Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple (AAPL), the relevant news is the pause in AI-generated news summaries due to errors. This could be perceived negatively by investors as it highlights potential flaws in Apple's AI initiatives, possibly leading to a short-term decline in investor confidence. However, the impact might be limited as this is not a core revenue-generating segment for Apple. The TikTok ban, while significant, does not directly impact Apple. Intel's news is unrelated to Apple. Given this, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past performance and future expectations. The company's historical success and strong track record have led to significant investor interest. However, the current price target only suggests a small potential upside of 4%, which might not be attractive for growth-focused investors. Additionally, the modest dividend yield of 0.43% may dissuade income-focused investors. Nevertheless, Apple's reputation and market dominance provide a solid foundation for maintaining its stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
