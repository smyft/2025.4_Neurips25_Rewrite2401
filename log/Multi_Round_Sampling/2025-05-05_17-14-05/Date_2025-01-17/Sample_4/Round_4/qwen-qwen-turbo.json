Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the potential ban of TikTok may lead to a redistribution of its users and advertising revenue among competitors like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat. This could result in a decrease in user engagement for platforms associated with Apple, specifically if TikTok is removed from the App Store. Additionally, uncertainties about legal risks for Apple could create negative sentiment among investors, which may result in a higher probability of stock price decline. However, the extent of this impact on Apple's overall business model remains uncertain.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance and potential future growth. While the historical performance is impressive, it's already reflected in the current stock price. The forward-looking information is mixed. Analysts predict a 4% upside, which is mildly positive. The article also points out potential downsides, such as the modest dividend yield and that it might not be attractive to growth-focused investors. Q1 2025 earnings are expected to be positive, but this is already factored in by analysts - if Apple reports Q1 earnings results lower than expected there will be a significant stock price drop. Overall, the article presents a balanced view, suggesting that the news is neither strongly bullish nor strongly bearish. Therefore, stock price will be neutral (0.4) to positive (0.6).\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration.  While Nvidia's advancements are positive, the article's relevance to Apple is minimal.  The mention of Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration is purely contextual and doesn't suggest any direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price, either positively or negatively. Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the US ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the ban could reduce the number of apps available on the App Store, potentially affecting Apple's services revenue. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple's competitors in the social media space, such as Meta (META), which might see increased advertising revenue. However, Apple's core business is not directly tied to TikTok's operations, and the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the potential for increased advertising spend on other platforms that may benefit Apple indirectly. The uncertainty around Trump's potential executive order and the legal complexities add some risk, but it is not expected to significantly impact Apple's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics stocks, including Peloton (PTON), GoPro (GPRO), Apple (AAPL), and Sonos (SONO). The article highlights that Apple's Q3 earnings were satisfactory, with revenues up 6.1% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite this positive performance, the stock price reaction is relatively muted, with Apple's stock up only 1.7% since the earnings report. Considering the overall positive earnings report and the general trend of the stock market, which has been thriving in 2024, it seems that the market has already priced in the satisfactory performance. However, the uncertainty about the outlook for 2025, including potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes, might cap the upside potential. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple pausing its AI-generated news alerts due to inaccuracy issues may have a minor negative impact on the company's stock price. The issue is related to a specific feature and does not appear to be a major concern for the company's overall financial performance or long-term strategy. However, the fact that Apple is taking steps to address the issue and improve the feature may be seen as a positive sign of the company's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. Given the relatively minor nature of the issue and the company's quick response to address it, the probability of a significant stock price movement is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past performance and future expectations. The company's historical success and strong expected earnings have led to a positive analyst outlook. Despite the modest dividend yield and limited expected upside potential, the overall context suggests a stable and potentially growing stock. The news does not introduce any negative factors that would likely cause a stock price fall but does highlight a limited upside potential.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The ruling against TikTok poses potential challenges for Apple due to legal risks surrounding the app's presence in the App Store, which could lead to reduced user engagement on the platform if users migrate to competitors like Instagram and YouTube. This shift might negatively impact Apple's services revenue and create a cautious sentiment among investors, leading to an increased probability of a stock price decline. Moreover, while other competitors may benefit from TikTok's audience and revenue redistribution, the immediate implications for Apple regarding its app ecosystem and legal uncertainties dilute any potential positive outlook. Therefore, the estimated probabilities suggest a higher likelihood of stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article focuses on Apple's impressive historical performance and expected Q1 2025 earnings. The historical data showing substantial returns over the past 10 years paints a positive picture, potentially attracting investors. The expected earnings growth for Q1 2025 (EPS of $2.35, up from $2.18 year-over-year, and revenue expected to reach $124.40 billion, up from $119.58 billion) reinforces a positive outlook. However, the article also mentions a modest dividend yield and an analyst price target suggesting only a 4% upside, which could limit the enthusiasm of growth or dividend-focused investors. Given the positive earnings expectations and the article's overall tone, the probability of a price increase is slightly elevated. The prior turns have more neutral stances. After considering the previous rounds of predictions and taking on board that I have no unique information, the previous high and low average each other out.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration.  This news is largely irrelevant to Apple. The only connection is the mention of Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration, which is purely contextual and unlikely to impact Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions show a range of views, with some suggesting a slightly higher probability of a price rise and others closer to neutral. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the most likely scenario is that the news will have minimal impact on Apple's stock price. Any movement would likely be due to broader market factors or other news unrelated to this article.  The previous predictions' variance highlights the difficulty of predicting stock price movements based on limited, indirect news, reinforcing a neutral stance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the US ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, the ban could reduce the number of apps available on the App Store, potentially affecting Apple's services revenue. Additionally, there are legal uncertainties for Apple if it is required to enforce the ban, which could create negative investor sentiment. On the positive side, the ban could benefit Apple's competitors in the social media space, such as Meta (META), which might see increased advertising revenue, indirectly benefiting Apple. However, Apple's core business is not directly tied to TikTok's operations, and the overall impact is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The uncertainty around Trump's potential executive order and the legal complexities add some risk, but it is not expected to significantly impact Apple's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics stocks, including Apple (AAPL). Apple's Q3 earnings were satisfactory, with revenues up 6.1% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. The stock price reaction is relatively muted, with Apple's stock up only 1.7% since the earnings report.

Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple pausing its AI-generated news alerts due to inaccuracy issues is a minor negative development, but the company's swift response to address the issue may be seen as a positive sign of its commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. Considering the relatively minor nature of the issue and the company's quick response, the probability of a significant stock price movement is low. The previous predictions from other models show a trend of neutral to slightly positive expectations for Apple's stock price. Given this context, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past performance and future expectations, including robust projected earnings and positive historical returns. While Apple's expected earnings and current stock valuation suggest a stable market position, the modest dividend yield and limited potential upside suggest caution. Moreover, some past predictions point towards uncertainty in stock price movements due to mixed implications. However, recent earnings and analyst ratings suggest a moderately positive outlook, offsetting the cautious sentiments. Considering all these factors, the stock has a moderate chance of slight growth.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The recent ruling regarding the potential ban on TikTok brings uncertainty to Apple due to possible legal risks and implications for user engagement, as TikTok's audience may migrate to competitors like Instagram and YouTube, potentially impacting Apple's services revenue negatively. The analysis of previous predictions indicates a more cautious sentiment among analysts, with concerns over legal liabilities and competition affecting the mood around Apple's stock. However, some predictions suggest that despite these challenges, the impact on Apple's core business might be neutral to slightly positive. Balancing these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article focuses on Apple's impressive historical performance and projects continued growth, as indicated by the expected Q1 2025 earnings report. While the highlighted past performance is substantial, it may already be factored into the current stock price. Analysts' consensus suggests a 'Buy' rating and a 4% upside, which is modestly positive but might not excite growth-oriented investors. The modest dividend yield further limits appeal to income investors. Considering these factors, the positive earnings expectations for Q1 2025, and acknowledging that previous predictions are mixed, I anticipate a slightly positive outlook. The previous rounds have a range of predictions, so I will weigh them in my estimate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's developments and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple. The only tangential connection is the mention of Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration, which is highly unlikely to influence Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, from a slight likelihood of a price increase to a neutral stance. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on its stock price.  Any movement would likely be driven by broader market trends or other news unrelated to the article.  Considering the lack of direct impact and the inconsistent predictions in previous rounds, I assign near-equal probabilities to a price rise and a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the US ban on TikTok has mixed implications for Apple Inc.

Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling. The previous predictions from other models show a range of views, but generally support a neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Apple pausing its AI-generated news alerts due to inaccuracy issues is a minor negative development, but the company's swift response to address the issue may be seen as a positive sign of its commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.

Moreover, some past predictions point towards uncertainty in stock price movements due to mixed implications. However, recent earnings and analyst ratings suggest a moderately positive outlook, offsetting the cautious sentiments. Considering all these factors, the stock has a moderate chance of slight growth.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The recent Supreme Court ruling to uphold the TikTok ban introduces legal uncertainties for Apple, particularly regarding its App Store. While it presents potential challenges due to possible loss of user engagement on the platform and related advertising revenue, it is also recognized that competitors could benefit from TikTok's audience shift. Many analysts maintain mixed outlooks, with some noting that Apple's core business isn't directly tied to TikTok, suggesting a moderate potential for stock price movement. However, the prevailing legal risks and competition concerns weigh more heavily, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance and expected future earnings. The impressive historical returns suggest a positive sentiment, but this is likely already priced into the stock. Analysts predict modest upside (4%), which might not excite investors, and the dividend yield is low. Q1 2025 earnings are expected to be positive but factored into expectations, so better results might create a boost. The previous turn's range from TikTok ban concerns to neutral based on irrelevant news. I previously predicted it to be equal but now it seems that it is neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price. However, the previous turns had a slight upward trend. Given these factors, the earnings result will likely cause a slight uptick.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Nvidia's activities, with only tangential relevance to Apple.  The mention of Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration is purely contextual and unlikely to impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement based on this news alone. While some models lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, referencing Apple's historical performance and positive earnings expectations, others emphasize the lack of direct impact from the Nvidia news.  Given the minimal direct connection between the news and Apple, and the inconsistency of previous model predictions, the most likely scenario is that this news will have a negligible impact on AAPL's stock price. Any price movement will likely be driven by broader market factors or unrelated news. I've considered the trend of the earlier predictions in this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the US ban on TikTok has mixed implications for Apple Inc.
