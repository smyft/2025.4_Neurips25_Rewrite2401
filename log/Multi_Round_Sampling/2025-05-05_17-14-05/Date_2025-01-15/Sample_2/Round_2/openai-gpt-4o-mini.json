(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Goldman Sachs Eyes Early Apple Card Exit -- What It Means for Investors and Apple's Ecosystem\nNews Content: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its partnership with Apple Card could create short-term uncertainty for Apple, as it may impact user experience with their financial products. However, Apple's strong brand reputation and history of innovation suggest that they could manage the transition effectively. Thus, while there is a significant concern about disruption, the long-term outlook for Apple remains solid. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a moderate chance of decline due to initial market reaction, but limited long-term damage, hence a lower probability of rise and a moderate probability of fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, which can be seen as a positive signal to investors who might be concerned about the company's future growth. The article also mentions Apple's stock performance after the WWDC conference, indicating a positive reaction to their product announcements. However, the article also points out concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date, as well as questions about the company's ability to push AI to consumers through its products. The mention of other AI stocks presenting more promising opportunities could also detract from Apple's appeal. Overall, the news is neutral, but with the added layer of Apple being mentioned alongside \"more promising\" AI stocks, I lean towards a slightly lower probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall. It's important to remember this is based solely on this one article and a comprehensive analysis would consider various market factors, Apple's financial reports, and broader analyst sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article focuses on a shift away from the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, towards a broader diversification within the S&P 500.  While Apple's recent performance is noted as down 8% year-to-date, the article suggests that the current market environment (higher bond yields, inflated tech expectations) may not favor these large-cap tech stocks.  The recommendation to invest in other sectors, especially financials showing strong earnings growth, implies a potential relative underperformance of Apple compared to other parts of the market.  However, the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple, and Apple's long-term prospects remain strong. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but it's not a strong prediction either way due to the indirect nature of the news regarding Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various topics, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any substantial new information or catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Cramer's remarks about innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs' death are subjective and do not indicate any fundamental changes in the company's operations or financials. The broader market context mentioned (e.g., inflation, bond market reactions) is not specific to Apple. Given the lack of concrete news affecting Apple's business, the stock price is likely to remain stable in the short term. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are balanced but slightly skewed towards no significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL), to other S&P 500 stocks. The article suggests that the Mag 7 stocks, which have high valuations and expectations, may experience a slowdown in earnings growth. Specifically, it mentions that the Mag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from their 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, the article notes that rising bond yields, such as the 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5%, have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as being down 8% year to date. This negative sentiment and potential for slower growth could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a fall in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline often indicates potential challenges or downsides that could affect the company's stock price, such as market competition, regulatory issues, or internal company problems. Given the negative tone of the headline, it is reasonable to infer that the probabilities skew towards a decline in stock price rather than an increase. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling would be higher than the probability of it rising based on this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt. Apple has shown a minimal net debt load, strong cash reserves, and robust EBIT margins that exceed interest coverage requirements by a large margin. This indicates a company with a healthy balance sheet, capable of managing its liabilities effectively. Additionally, the company\u2019s cash flows are strong, further supporting its ability to manage debt or expand operations. These factors suggest a low risk profile, potentially bolstering investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its partnership with the Apple Card introduces uncertainty regarding Apple's financial products, which could negatively impact user experience. This uncertainty might lead to a short-term dip in Apple's stock price. However, Apple has a strong brand reputation and has historically demonstrated resilience amidst challenges. While initial market reactions may lean towards a decline due to the partnership concerns, Apple\u2019s innovative capabilities and strong ecosystem may limit long-term damage. Considering this mixed outlook and the analysis of previous predictions that lean towards a modest probability of decline, I estimate a higher likelihood of falling stock price in the short term but maintain some confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple's innovation against criticisms, which can be seen as a positive. The article mentions Apple's stock performance after WWDC, indicating a positive reaction to past announcements. However, it also raises concerns about year-to-date performance and Apple's ability to lead in AI. The mention of seemingly 'more promising' AI stocks and Cramer spending more time recently talking about those stocks and other CEO's is also a detracting factor. The fact that AAPL is ranked 3rd on the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed and that the article points to some AI stocks holding greater promise indicate some concern about Apple. Considering this mixed information, and the trend of previous rounds predicting more of a fall in stock price, I will skew my prediction slightly lower. While Cramer's defense is a positive signal, the concerns surrounding competition in the AI space and year-to-date stock performance seem to weigh more heavily.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a shift in investor sentiment away from the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, towards smaller-cap S&P 500 companies. This shift is driven by factors such as higher bond yields and perceived overvaluation of large tech stocks. While the article highlights the potential for strong earnings growth in other sectors and suggests Apple's earnings growth may slow, it doesn't provide any specific negative news about Apple's fundamentals.  The 8% year-to-date decline is already priced into the stock, and the article's tone is more of a suggestion for portfolio diversification rather than a bearish prediction for Apple specifically. Considering the previous predictions showing varied opinions (ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 probabilities of price rise), I lean towards a neutral stance, slightly favoring a small likelihood of price increase due to potential market overreaction to the 'Mag 7' narrative. The previous predictions demonstrate a wide range of opinions, and this article doesn't provide a substantial shift in information for Apple specifically.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on the debate around innovation since Steve Jobs' death and the broader market context. While Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date and its ability to push AI to consumers. The mixed sentiment, combined with the lack of concrete new information or catalysts, suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting market uncertainty and potential short-term negative sentiment. Therefore, the probabilities are skewed slightly towards a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) stocks, which include Apple Inc.

This negative sentiment and potential for slower growth could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a fall in stock price.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Most models predict a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling, with probabilities of a rise ranging from 0.3 to 0.45 and probabilities of a fall ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. However, one model (qwen/qwen-turbo) provided a significantly different prediction, which may indicate that it has access to different information. Given the overall trend and the negative tone of the news headline, I will estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt, with minimal net debt, strong cash reserves, and robust EBIT margins exceeding interest coverage requirements. This suggests a company with a healthy balance sheet that effectively manages its liabilities. While some past predictions leaned towards the stock price falling, reflecting concerns about market dynamics and potential disruptions, the recent news emphasizes Apple's financial resilience and strong management of debt. This could bolster investor confidence, reducing fears of debt-related risks. Considering this information, the probability of stock price rise is higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
