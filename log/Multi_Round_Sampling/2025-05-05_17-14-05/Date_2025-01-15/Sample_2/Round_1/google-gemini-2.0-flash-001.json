(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its partnership with Apple Card could create short-term uncertainty for Apple, as it may impact user experience with their financial products. However, Apple's strong brand reputation and history of innovation suggest that they could manage the transition effectively. Thus, while there is a significant concern about disruption, the long-term outlook for Apple remains solid. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a moderate chance of decline due to initial market reaction, but limited long-term damage, hence a lower probability of rise and a moderate probability of fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, which can be seen as a positive signal to investors who might be concerned about the company's future growth. The article also mentions Apple's stock performance after the WWDC conference, indicating a positive reaction to their product announcements. However, the article also points out concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date, as well as questions about the company's ability to push AI to consumers through its products. The mention of other AI stocks presenting more promising opportunities could also detract from Apple's appeal. Overall, the news is neutral, but with the added layer of Apple being mentioned alongside \"more promising\" AI stocks, I lean towards a slightly lower probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall. It's important to remember this is based solely on this one article and a comprehensive analysis would consider various market factors, Apple's financial reports, and broader analyst sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article focuses on a shift away from the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, towards a broader diversification within the S&P 500.  While Apple's recent performance is noted as down 8% year-to-date, the article suggests that the current market environment (higher bond yields, inflated tech expectations) may not favor these large-cap tech stocks.  The recommendation to invest in other sectors, especially financials showing strong earnings growth, implies a potential relative underperformance of Apple compared to other parts of the market.  However, the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple, and Apple's long-term prospects remain strong. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but it's not a strong prediction either way due to the indirect nature of the news regarding Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various topics, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any substantial new information or catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Cramer's remarks about innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs' death are subjective and do not indicate any fundamental changes in the company's operations or financials. The broader market context mentioned (e.g., inflation, bond market reactions) is not specific to Apple. Given the lack of concrete news affecting Apple's business, the stock price is likely to remain stable in the short term. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are balanced but slightly skewed towards no significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL), to other S&P 500 stocks. The article suggests that the Mag 7 stocks, which have high valuations and expectations, may experience a slowdown in earnings growth. Specifically, it mentions that the Mag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from their 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, the article notes that rising bond yields, such as the 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5%, have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as being down 8% year to date. This negative sentiment and potential for slower growth could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a fall in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline often indicates potential challenges or downsides that could affect the company's stock price, such as market competition, regulatory issues, or internal company problems. Given the negative tone of the headline, it is reasonable to infer that the probabilities skew towards a decline in stock price rather than an increase. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling would be higher than the probability of it rising based on this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt. Apple has shown a minimal net debt load, strong cash reserves, and robust EBIT margins that exceed interest coverage requirements by a large margin. This indicates a company with a healthy balance sheet, capable of managing its liabilities effectively. Additionally, the company\u2019s cash flows are strong, further supporting its ability to manage debt or expand operations. These factors suggest a low risk profile, potentially bolstering investor confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple's innovation against criticisms, which can be seen as a positive. The article mentions Apple's stock performance after WWDC, indicating a positive reaction to past announcements. However, it also raises concerns about year-to-date performance and Apple's ability to lead in AI. The mention of seemingly 'more promising' AI stocks and Cramer spending more time recently talking about those stocks and other CEO's is also a detracting factor. The fact that AAPL is ranked 3rd on the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed and that the article points to some AI stocks holding greater promise indicate some concern about Apple. Considering this mixed information, and the trend of previous rounds predicting more of a fall in stock price, I will skew my prediction slightly lower. While Cramer's defense is a positive signal, the concerns surrounding competition in the AI space and year-to-date stock performance seem to weigh more heavily.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
