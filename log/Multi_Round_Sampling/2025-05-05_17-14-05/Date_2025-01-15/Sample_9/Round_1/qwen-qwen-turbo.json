(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly in the context of innovation and market conditions. He defends Apple against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which may positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns around the broader market dynamics, such as inflation and interest rates, could also lead to cautious trading of Apple stock. Despite these factors, Cramer's affirmation of Apple's market position and the mention of ongoing competition in the tech sector might suggest a moderate bullish outlook for the stock. Overall, given the divided nature of the information, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a rise in the stock price rather than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, which can be seen as a positive signal to investors who might be concerned about the company's future growth. The article also mentions Apple's stock performance after the WWDC conference, indicating a positive reaction to their product announcements. However, the article also points out concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date, as well as questions about the company's ability to push AI to consumers through its products. The mention of other AI stocks presenting more promising opportunities could also detract from Apple's appeal. Overall, the news is neutral, but with the added layer of Apple being mentioned alongside \"more promising\" AI stocks, I lean towards a slightly lower probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall. It's important to remember this is based solely on this one article and a comprehensive analysis would consider various market factors, Apple's financial reports, and broader analyst sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, highlighting its \"timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\" However, it also notes that Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple recently, and that Apple's revenue and iPhone sales have been stagnant.  While the article points to the potential of Apple's new AI-powered tools and processor chip as a catalyst for future growth in the expanding AI market, this is a long-term prospect.  The described reduction in Berkshire's holding suggests a lack of immediate confidence in short-term growth, despite the company's overall large investment.  Therefore, the news is mixed. While the association with Buffett remains positive, the recent reduction in holdings introduces uncertainty, creating a relatively neutral outlook in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial health. Key points include: 1) Apple's net debt is relatively low at $41.5B, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.31, indicating manageable debt levels. 2) Apple's EBIT covers its interest expense 673 times, showcasing its ability to service debt comfortably. 3) The company has robust free cash flow (90% of EBIT), which positions it well for debt repayment if needed. 4) Apple's market capitalization ($3.51T) further underscores its financial stability. Given these positive indicators, the news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the company's overall financial trajectory. Apple's ability to innovate and its strong brand loyalty will likely help the company navigate this change smoothly. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products may cause some users to express concern, but Apple's history of prioritizing user experience suggests that the company will find a way to maintain its high standards. Additionally, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may even lead to improvements in the Apple Card and Savings products. Therefore, while there may be some short-term volatility, the long-term prospects for AAPL remain strong.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
