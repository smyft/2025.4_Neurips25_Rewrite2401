(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly in the context of innovation and market conditions. He defends Apple against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which may positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns around the broader market dynamics, such as inflation and interest rates, could also lead to cautious trading of Apple stock. Despite these factors, Cramer's affirmation of Apple's market position and the mention of ongoing competition in the tech sector might suggest a moderate bullish outlook for the stock. Overall, given the divided nature of the information, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a rise in the stock price rather than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, which can be seen as a positive signal to investors who might be concerned about the company's future growth. The article also mentions Apple's stock performance after the WWDC conference, indicating a positive reaction to their product announcements. However, the article also points out concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date, as well as questions about the company's ability to push AI to consumers through its products. The mention of other AI stocks presenting more promising opportunities could also detract from Apple's appeal. Overall, the news is neutral, but with the added layer of Apple being mentioned alongside \"more promising\" AI stocks, I lean towards a slightly lower probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall. It's important to remember this is based solely on this one article and a comprehensive analysis would consider various market factors, Apple's financial reports, and broader analyst sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, highlighting its \"timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\" However, it also notes that Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple recently, and that Apple's revenue and iPhone sales have been stagnant.  While the article points to the potential of Apple's new AI-powered tools and processor chip as a catalyst for future growth in the expanding AI market, this is a long-term prospect.  The described reduction in Berkshire's holding suggests a lack of immediate confidence in short-term growth, despite the company's overall large investment.  Therefore, the news is mixed. While the association with Buffett remains positive, the recent reduction in holdings introduces uncertainty, creating a relatively neutral outlook in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial health. Key points include: 1) Apple's net debt is relatively low at $41.5B, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.31, indicating manageable debt levels. 2) Apple's EBIT covers its interest expense 673 times, showcasing its ability to service debt comfortably. 3) The company has robust free cash flow (90% of EBIT), which positions it well for debt repayment if needed. 4) Apple's market capitalization ($3.51T) further underscores its financial stability. Given these positive indicators, the news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the company's overall financial trajectory. Apple's ability to innovate and its strong brand loyalty will likely help the company navigate this change smoothly. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products may cause some users to express concern, but Apple's history of prioritizing user experience suggests that the company will find a way to maintain its high standards. Additionally, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may even lead to improvements in the Apple Card and Savings products. Therefore, while there may be some short-term volatility, the long-term prospects for AAPL remain strong.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
