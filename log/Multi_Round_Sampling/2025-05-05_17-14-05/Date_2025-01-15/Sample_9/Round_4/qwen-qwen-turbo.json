(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly in the context of innovation and market conditions. He defends Apple against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which may positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns around the broader market dynamics, such as inflation and interest rates, could also lead to cautious trading of Apple stock. Despite these factors, Cramer's affirmation of Apple's market position and the mention of ongoing competition in the tech sector might suggest a moderate bullish outlook for the stock. Overall, given the divided nature of the information, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a rise in the stock price rather than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, which can be seen as a positive signal to investors who might be concerned about the company's future growth. The article also mentions Apple's stock performance after the WWDC conference, indicating a positive reaction to their product announcements. However, the article also points out concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date, as well as questions about the company's ability to push AI to consumers through its products. The mention of other AI stocks presenting more promising opportunities could also detract from Apple's appeal. Overall, the news is neutral, but with the added layer of Apple being mentioned alongside \"more promising\" AI stocks, I lean towards a slightly lower probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall. It's important to remember this is based solely on this one article and a comprehensive analysis would consider various market factors, Apple's financial reports, and broader analyst sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, highlighting its \"timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\" However, it also notes that Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple recently, and that Apple's revenue and iPhone sales have been stagnant.  While the article points to the potential of Apple's new AI-powered tools and processor chip as a catalyst for future growth in the expanding AI market, this is a long-term prospect.  The described reduction in Berkshire's holding suggests a lack of immediate confidence in short-term growth, despite the company's overall large investment.  Therefore, the news is mixed. While the association with Buffett remains positive, the recent reduction in holdings introduces uncertainty, creating a relatively neutral outlook in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial health. Key points include: 1) Apple's net debt is relatively low at $41.5B, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.31, indicating manageable debt levels. 2) Apple's EBIT covers its interest expense 673 times, showcasing its ability to service debt comfortably. 3) The company has robust free cash flow (90% of EBIT), which positions it well for debt repayment if needed. 4) Apple's market capitalization ($3.51T) further underscores its financial stability. Given these positive indicators, the news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the company's overall financial trajectory. Apple's ability to innovate and its strong brand loyalty will likely help the company navigate this change smoothly. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products may cause some users to express concern, but Apple's history of prioritizing user experience suggests that the company will find a way to maintain its high standards. Additionally, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may even lead to improvements in the Apple Card and Savings products. Therefore, while there may be some short-term volatility, the long-term prospects for AAPL remain strong.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news denotes mixed sentiments surrounding Apple's stock performance. Jim Cramer defends the company against claims of stagnation in innovation since Steve Jobs, which could buoy investor sentiment somewhat. However, concerns regarding the company's ability to push AI products to consumers and competition from other AI-focused stocks could dampen enthusiasm. Furthermore, there are ongoing macroeconomic worries related to inflation and interest rates, which tend to influence stock performance negatively. Taking all this into account, there is a slight inclination toward a price rise due to Cramer\u2019s defense of Apple, balanced by significant concerns in the broader market, leading to a moderate overall outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. Jim Cramer's defense against claims of lacking innovation is a positive signal. However, the context is a discussion about broader economic factors like inflation and interest rates, which could negatively impact the market. Concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the suggestion that other AI stocks might be more promising add another layer of complexity. Considering other predictions, there's a wide range of opinions (0.3 to 0.7 for price rise), leaning towards neutrality or slight bearishness. Given this, and based on the current news that contains both positive (Cramer's defense) and negative elements (concerns about AI and other stocks potentially offering better returns), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, which is generally positive. However, it also highlights that Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple recently, and that Apple's revenue and iPhone sales have been stagnant.  While the article mentions potential for future growth in AI, this is a long-term prospect and not reflected in current performance. The reduction in Berkshire's holding suggests a lack of immediate confidence in short-term growth.  The fact that this article is about which Buffett stocks to buy *with $1000 right now* implies a short-term to medium-term focus. The mention of Apple in this context, alongside other companies showcasing significant growth, might make it seem less attractive to new investors looking for quick gains.  Considering the mixed signals and the short-term focus of the news piece, the probability of a stock price increase is only slightly higher than the probability of a decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial health. Key points include: 1) Apple's net debt is relatively low at $41.5B, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.31, indicating manageable debt levels. 2) Apple's EBIT covers its interest expense 673 times, showcasing its ability to service debt comfortably. 3) The company has robust free cash flow (90% of EBIT), which positions it well for debt repayment if needed. 4) Apple's market capitalization ($3.51T) further underscores its financial stability. Given these positive indicators, the news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise. Previous predictions also show a trend towards a positive outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of a rise than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but the company's strong brand and history of innovation are likely to mitigate long-term effects. Short-term volatility is possible due to the potential disruption of Apple Card and Savings products. However, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, could lead to improvements in these products. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the provided predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions from slightly bullish to bearish, a moderate outlook seems most appropriate. The fact that some models predict a higher probability of the stock falling could indicate concerns about immediate financial impacts or broader market sentiments. However, Apple's robust financial health and capacity for innovation should support its stock price in the long run.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news regarding Jim Cramer defending Apple against innovation claims offers a bullish sentiment, providing some support for the stock. However, concerns remain around Apple's ability to foster AI innovation and its year-to-date performance. The mixed messages about broader economic conditions, such as inflation and interest rates, and the competitive landscape with other tech stocks suggest caution among investors. Cramer's support may encourage some purchasing activity, but uncertainty about immediate growth prospects could inhibit significant upward movement. Overall, this leads to a slightly bullish outlook, reflected in a probability of a rise, albeit moderated by broader market challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag. Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation is a positive signal, but it's countered by concerns about AI competition and general market anxieties related to inflation and interest rates. The previous predictions vary widely, showing uncertainty, but there's a slight tendency toward bearishness. Given the lack of strong direction in the news itself and the divided opinions of other models, I will keep a neutral direction with slightly leaning towards rising, and I will put more weights on the gpt-4o's prediction, as it is a stronger model that could provide reasonable predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Warren Buffett's holdings and positions them as investment opportunities.  While Apple is mentioned as a significant holding of Berkshire Hathaway, the article also highlights Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple and the stagnation of Apple's revenue and iPhone sales. This is a bearish signal.  The article mentions Apple's foray into AI as a potential future growth driver, but this is a long-term prospect and unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in the short-term.  The inclusion of Apple in this list alongside other companies that display robust growth could be interpreted negatively, as it suggests Apple is not currently a top performer in Buffett's portfolio compared to its mention with other companies.  Considering the mixed signals and that the news focuses on a short- to medium-term investment strategy, I place a slightly higher probability on a price fall. The previous predictions are mixed, with a trend towards slightly more bullish sentiment, but still centering around neutral or slightly bearish outcomes. I'm factoring in the generally negative sentiment towards the \"Magnificent Seven\", including Apple, suggested in some previous analyses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial health. Key points include: 1) Apple's net debt is relatively low at $41.5B, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.31, indicating manageable debt levels. 2) Apple's EBIT covers its interest expense 673 times, showcasing its ability to service debt comfortably. 3) The company has robust free cash flow (90% of EBIT), which positions it well for debt repayment if needed. 4) Apple's market capitalization ($3.51T) further underscores its financial stability.

The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.

However, there are significant concerns about Apple's ability to keep up with AI competitors and general market dynamics such as inflation and interest rates that could impact investor sentiment negatively. Predictions from various models have shown a mixed bag, with some favoring a price rise slightly while others lean bearish due to concerns about Apple's revenue growth and competition. Overall, this leads to a moderate probability of a stock price rise, balanced by risks of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article presents mixed signals. On one hand, Jim Cramer defending Apple against claims of lacking innovation is a bullish signal. On the other hand, concerns about AI competition, broader macroeconomic anxieties related to inflation and interest rates, and potentially better opportunities in other AI stocks represent bearish signals. Considering previous predictions, there's a wide range with a slight bearish tendency. While the defense from Cramer gives some positive support, the other mixed factors including year-to-date performance, competitive landscape with other tech stocks creates enough cautionary elements that leans towards a slight lower probability of price increase but overall a neutral outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Warren Buffett's holdings and presents them as investment opportunities. Apple is mentioned positively as a significant holding of Berkshire Hathaway, but the article also highlights that Buffett has recently reduced his stake in Apple and that Apple's revenue and iPhone sales have been stagnant.  This is a bearish signal. The article does mention Apple's foray into AI as a potential future growth driver, but this is a long-term prospect unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in the short term. The context of the article, suggesting that other companies are more attractive current investments, further weighs against a short-term price increase for Apple. While several previous models predicted a slightly higher chance of a rise, a significant portion of them showed a belief in the likelihood of a fall or a neutral stance. Considering the mixed signals and short- to medium-term focus of the news piece, along with the trend seen in the various model predictions, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, though the overall probability range remains relatively tight.  The mention of Apple within a broader discussion of Buffett's holdings might moderate the negative impact of the reduced Berkshire Hathaway stake.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt and strong financial health, which are positive indicators for investors. Key points include Apple's low net debt ($41.5B), manageable debt levels (net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.31), and robust free cash flow (90% of EBIT). These factors suggest Apple is in a strong position to handle its debt and continue growing. Previous predictions from other models show a trend towards a positive outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of a rise than a fall. Given these positive indicators and the overall sentiment from previous rounds, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly his defense against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs.

According to experts, these other stocks could present better valuations and growth opportunities, particularly in sectors like financials where earnings are expected to grow faster. This shift could potentially impact investor interest in high-profile tech stocks like Apple. However, Apple remains resilient due to its strong financial health and brand strength, though concerns about inflation and interest rates could temper optimism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
