(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly in the context of innovation and market conditions. He defends Apple against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which may positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns around the broader market dynamics, such as inflation and interest rates, could also lead to cautious trading of Apple stock. Despite these factors, Cramer's affirmation of Apple's market position and the mention of ongoing competition in the tech sector might suggest a moderate bullish outlook for the stock. Overall, given the divided nature of the information, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a rise in the stock price rather than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, which can be seen as a positive signal to investors who might be concerned about the company's future growth. The article also mentions Apple's stock performance after the WWDC conference, indicating a positive reaction to their product announcements. However, the article also points out concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date, as well as questions about the company's ability to push AI to consumers through its products. The mention of other AI stocks presenting more promising opportunities could also detract from Apple's appeal. Overall, the news is neutral, but with the added layer of Apple being mentioned alongside \"more promising\" AI stocks, I lean towards a slightly lower probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall. It's important to remember this is based solely on this one article and a comprehensive analysis would consider various market factors, Apple's financial reports, and broader analyst sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, highlighting its \"timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\" However, it also notes that Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple recently, and that Apple's revenue and iPhone sales have been stagnant.  While the article points to the potential of Apple's new AI-powered tools and processor chip as a catalyst for future growth in the expanding AI market, this is a long-term prospect.  The described reduction in Berkshire's holding suggests a lack of immediate confidence in short-term growth, despite the company's overall large investment.  Therefore, the news is mixed. While the association with Buffett remains positive, the recent reduction in holdings introduces uncertainty, creating a relatively neutral outlook in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial health. Key points include: 1) Apple's net debt is relatively low at $41.5B, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.31, indicating manageable debt levels. 2) Apple's EBIT covers its interest expense 673 times, showcasing its ability to service debt comfortably. 3) The company has robust free cash flow (90% of EBIT), which positions it well for debt repayment if needed. 4) Apple's market capitalization ($3.51T) further underscores its financial stability. Given these positive indicators, the news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the company's overall financial trajectory. Apple's ability to innovate and its strong brand loyalty will likely help the company navigate this change smoothly. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products may cause some users to express concern, but Apple's history of prioritizing user experience suggests that the company will find a way to maintain its high standards. Additionally, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may even lead to improvements in the Apple Card and Savings products. Therefore, while there may be some short-term volatility, the long-term prospects for AAPL remain strong.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news denotes mixed sentiments surrounding Apple's stock performance. Jim Cramer defends the company against claims of stagnation in innovation since Steve Jobs, which could buoy investor sentiment somewhat. However, concerns regarding the company's ability to push AI products to consumers and competition from other AI-focused stocks could dampen enthusiasm. Furthermore, there are ongoing macroeconomic worries related to inflation and interest rates, which tend to influence stock performance negatively. Taking all this into account, there is a slight inclination toward a price rise due to Cramer\u2019s defense of Apple, balanced by significant concerns in the broader market, leading to a moderate overall outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. Jim Cramer's defense against claims of lacking innovation is a positive signal. However, the context is a discussion about broader economic factors like inflation and interest rates, which could negatively impact the market. Concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the suggestion that other AI stocks might be more promising add another layer of complexity. Considering other predictions, there's a wide range of opinions (0.3 to 0.7 for price rise), leaning towards neutrality or slight bearishness. Given this, and based on the current news that contains both positive (Cramer's defense) and negative elements (concerns about AI and other stocks potentially offering better returns), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, which is generally positive. However, it also highlights that Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple recently, and that Apple's revenue and iPhone sales have been stagnant.  While the article mentions potential for future growth in AI, this is a long-term prospect and not reflected in current performance. The reduction in Berkshire's holding suggests a lack of immediate confidence in short-term growth.  The fact that this article is about which Buffett stocks to buy *with $1000 right now* implies a short-term to medium-term focus. The mention of Apple in this context, alongside other companies showcasing significant growth, might make it seem less attractive to new investors looking for quick gains.  Considering the mixed signals and the short-term focus of the news piece, the probability of a stock price increase is only slightly higher than the probability of a decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial health. Key points include: 1) Apple's net debt is relatively low at $41.5B, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.31, indicating manageable debt levels. 2) Apple's EBIT covers its interest expense 673 times, showcasing its ability to service debt comfortably. 3) The company has robust free cash flow (90% of EBIT), which positions it well for debt repayment if needed. 4) Apple's market capitalization ($3.51T) further underscores its financial stability. Given these positive indicators, the news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise. Previous predictions also show a trend towards a positive outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of a rise than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but the company's strong brand and history of innovation are likely to mitigate long-term effects. Short-term volatility is possible due to the potential disruption of Apple Card and Savings products. However, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, could lead to improvements in these products. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the provided predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions from slightly bullish to bearish, a moderate outlook seems most appropriate. The fact that some models predict a higher probability of the stock falling could indicate concerns about immediate financial impacts or broader market sentiments. However, Apple's robust financial health and capacity for innovation should support its stock price in the long run.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news regarding Jim Cramer defending Apple against innovation claims offers a bullish sentiment, providing some support for the stock. However, concerns remain around Apple's ability to foster AI innovation and its year-to-date performance. The mixed messages about broader economic conditions, such as inflation and interest rates, and the competitive landscape with other tech stocks suggest caution among investors. Cramer's support may encourage some purchasing activity, but uncertainty about immediate growth prospects could inhibit significant upward movement. Overall, this leads to a slightly bullish outlook, reflected in a probability of a rise, albeit moderated by broader market challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag. Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation is a positive signal, but it's countered by concerns about AI competition and general market anxieties related to inflation and interest rates. The previous predictions vary widely, showing uncertainty, but there's a slight tendency toward bearishness. Given the lack of strong direction in the news itself and the divided opinions of other models, I will keep a neutral direction with slightly leaning towards rising, and I will put more weights on the gpt-4o's prediction, as it is a stronger model that could provide reasonable predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Warren Buffett's holdings and positions them as investment opportunities.  While Apple is mentioned as a significant holding of Berkshire Hathaway, the article also highlights Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple and the stagnation of Apple's revenue and iPhone sales. This is a bearish signal.  The article mentions Apple's foray into AI as a potential future growth driver, but this is a long-term prospect and unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in the short-term.  The inclusion of Apple in this list alongside other companies that display robust growth could be interpreted negatively, as it suggests Apple is not currently a top performer in Buffett's portfolio compared to its mention with other companies.  Considering the mixed signals and that the news focuses on a short- to medium-term investment strategy, I place a slightly higher probability on a price fall. The previous predictions are mixed, with a trend towards slightly more bullish sentiment, but still centering around neutral or slightly bearish outcomes. I'm factoring in the generally negative sentiment towards the \"Magnificent Seven\", including Apple, suggested in some previous analyses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial health.
