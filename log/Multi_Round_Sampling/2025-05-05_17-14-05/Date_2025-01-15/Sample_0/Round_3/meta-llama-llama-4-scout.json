(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple stock, stating that it 'could get hammered this year.' Generally, when a company receives negative news, it leads to pessimism among investors, which often results in a decrease in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is expected to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in market focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other opportunities within the S&P 500. Key points include: 1) Apple's stock is already down year-to-date (-8%); 2) The article highlights potentially faster earnings growth in the broader S&P 500 compared to the slowing growth of the Mag 7; 3) Rising bond yields are cited as a headwind for the Mag 7; 4) Analysts are suggesting looking at valuations outside of the 'Magnificent Seven'. All of these factors point towards downward pressure on Apple's stock. While not overtly negative towards Apple specifically, the overall tone implies underperformance relative to other sectors. However, the impact is likely softened by the fact Apple is a behemoth with strong fundamentals and brand loyalty, so it's unlikely to crash dramatically. This leads to a slightly higher than 50% chance of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and the broader market.  While Cramer dismisses Zuckerberg's assertion of a lack of innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs, this is not a strong bullish catalyst.  The article is largely a summary of Cramer's broader market commentary, including discussions on inflation, bonds,  Elon Musk, and AI stocks.  Cramer's mention of Apple is relatively brief and doesn't offer any specific positive or negative outlook for the company.  The overall tone suggests a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment towards the market in general, which might indirectly affect Apple's price. Given the lack of specific news about Apple's financial prospects or strategy,  the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively unchanged stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, indicating potential downward pressure. However, the provided content is minimal and lacks specific details (e.g., reasons for the bearish sentiment, such as weak earnings, regulatory issues, or market conditions). Without further context, the headline alone implies a higher probability of a fall than a rise, but the uncertainty is significant due to the lack of concrete information. Thus, the probability of a fall is moderately higher than a rise, but not extreme.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors may be shifting their focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (which includes Apple Inc.) and towards other S&P 500 stocks that could offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations. The article highlights that the financials sector is expected to have the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%, and that investors are looking for quality and growth in stocks. Apple's stock price has been underperforming this year, and with the market narrative shifting towards other sectors, there may be less attention and investment in Apple and other Mag 7 stocks. Additionally, with bond yields rising and expectations of potentially fewer Fed rate cuts, investors may be cautious about investing in tech stocks like Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the company's overall financial trajectory. Apple's ability to innovate and its strong brand loyalty will likely help the company navigate this change smoothly. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products may cause some users to express concern, but Apple's history of prioritizing user experience suggests that the company will find a way to maintain its high standards. Additionally, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may even lead to improvements in the Apple Card and Savings products. Therefore, while there may be some short-term volatility, the long-term prospects for AAPL remain strong.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple as a stock often recommended by Warren Buffett. While Apple's recent performance has shown stagnation, there are indications of potential growth with the launch of new AI-powered tools. The news provides a balanced view, mentioning both historical strengths and recent challenges. Given the strategic nature of Buffett's investments, there's a mixed sentiment but leaning towards optimism for growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline explicitly indicates that Apple's stock could face significant challenges this year, suggesting a negative outlook. This sentiment aligns with the prior predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of a price decline. Previous analyses highlight various pressures on Apple, such as investor sentiment shifting away from the 'Magnificent Seven', rising bond yields, and potential earnings slowdowns. Collectively, these factors contribute to a more pessimistic view of Apple\u2019s stock performance. Hence, I predict a higher likelihood of stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article suggests a shift in investor sentiment away from the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks with potentially better growth at reasonable valuations due to factors like rising bond yields and inflated tech expectations. While financials and other sectors are expected to show stronger growth, Apple's stock is already down YTD. This indicates downward pressure on Apple's stock. However, other's estimations are rather optimistic, thus, I will update my estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece is largely a summary of Jim Cramer's market commentary, with only a brief mention of Apple. Cramer's response to Zuckerberg's comment about Apple's innovation is neutral at best, neither strongly positive nor negative.  The lack of specific news regarding Apple's financial health or future strategy makes it unlikely that Cramer's comments alone will significantly impact the stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty around the impact of this news. Considering the lack of substantial information relating to AAPL's performance, and the fact that the overall market sentiment is a more significant factor than this specific news item, I'm assigning probabilities close to a neutral stance. However, given the prevailing uncertainty in the market and previous predictions slightly leaning towards a fall, I'm slightly weighting the probability towards a fall, but not substantially.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with the phrase 'could get hammered this year' indicating potential downward pressure. Previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, with probabilities of the stock price falling ranging from 0.4 to 0.75, and rising from 0.25 to 0.6. The most consistent theme across the models is the bearish sentiment due to factors like market shifts away from the 'Magnificent Seven', rising bond yields, and potential underperformance relative to other sectors. However, some models also highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty as mitigating factors. Given the overall negative tone of the headline and the consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a fall, but with some optimism due to Apple's resilience, the probabilities are weighted more towards a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks that may offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations. The article highlights that Apple's stock is down 8% year-to-date and that the 'Mag 7' names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, rising bond yields are cited as a headwind for the Mag 7. However, Apple is a large company with strong fundamentals and brand loyalty, which could mitigate a dramatic decline. Considering these factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but the company's strong brand loyalty, ability to innovate, and potential for finding a new partner could mitigate long-term negative impacts. The article suggests that Apple's ecosystem is robust and that the company will likely navigate this change smoothly. While there may be short-term volatility, the overall tone implies that Apple's financial trajectory will not be significantly altered. Considering the previous predictions, which showed a mix of sentiments with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling and others seeing it as less likely, the current news does not drastically alter the fundamental strengths of Apple. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, reflecting the potential for Apple to manage this change effectively and continue its long-term growth trajectory.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple as a stock often recommended by Warren Buffett. While Apple's recent performance has shown stagnation, there are indications of potential growth with the launch of new AI-powered tools. The news provides a balanced view, mentioning both historical strengths and recent challenges. Given the strategic nature of Buffett's investments, there's a mixed sentiment but leaning towards optimism for growth. Previous predictions from models were relatively varied, but many indicated a moderate expectation for a rise based on Apple's long-term strength and potential for growth in emerging areas like AI.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a significantly negative outlook for Apple Inc.'s stock. Previous predictions indicate a consensus of bearish sentiment due to various market factors, such as rising bond yields, shifts away from the 'Magnificent Seven', and overall pessimism regarding Apple's future earning potential. Most models predict higher probabilities of a stock price fall, reflecting concern about the company's performance amid a changing market landscape. The overall analysis indicates a stronger inclination towards a decline in stock price compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a negative outlook for Apple. While the article doesn't directly criticize Apple, it advocates for investing in the '493 other S&P 500 stocks' due to potentially faster earnings growth and more reasonable valuations compared to the 'Magnificent Seven'. The article highlights that Apple's year-to-date performance is down 8%, and rising bond yields, combined with potentially slowing earnings growth for the Mag 7, could put downward pressure on the stock. These elements point to a higher likelihood of a price decrease than an increase. Taking previous predictions in consideration, as well as the fact that some others are optimistic, my prediction remains negative, yet acknowledging a degree of uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news piece is primarily a summary of Jim Cramer's broader market commentary, with only a brief and relatively neutral mention of Apple. Cramer's rebuttal of Zuckerberg's claim regarding Apple's lack of innovation is not a strong bullish catalyst.  The lack of specific news about Apple's financial prospects or strategy suggests minimal direct impact on the stock price.  Previous predictions show a wide range, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding this news's effect. The overall market sentiment, rather than this specific commentary, appears to be a more significant factor. Considering the mixed and often negative sentiment in previous rounds regarding broader market trends impacting tech stocks like Apple (rising bond yields, potential shift away from the 'Magnificent Seven'), and the minimal direct impact of this news piece, a neutral to slightly bearish outlook is warranted.  The probabilities are weighted more towards a slight fall due to the prevailing market uncertainties, but the effect is likely small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with the phrase 'could get hammered this year' indicating potential downward pressure.

While the company faces challenges such as recent stock price stagnation and potential changes in market dynamics towards other sectors, Apple's strong brand, historical stock performance, and the development of new technologies like AI-powered tools provide reasons for optimism. The recent news does not present any strong negative information impacting the long-term outlook significantly.
