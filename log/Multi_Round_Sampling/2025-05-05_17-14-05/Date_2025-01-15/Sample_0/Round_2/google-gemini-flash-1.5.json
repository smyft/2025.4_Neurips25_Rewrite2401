(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple stock, stating that it 'could get hammered this year.' Generally, when a company receives negative news, it leads to pessimism among investors, which often results in a decrease in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is expected to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in market focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other opportunities within the S&P 500. Key points include: 1) Apple's stock is already down year-to-date (-8%); 2) The article highlights potentially faster earnings growth in the broader S&P 500 compared to the slowing growth of the Mag 7; 3) Rising bond yields are cited as a headwind for the Mag 7; 4) Analysts are suggesting looking at valuations outside of the 'Magnificent Seven'. All of these factors point towards downward pressure on Apple's stock. While not overtly negative towards Apple specifically, the overall tone implies underperformance relative to other sectors. However, the impact is likely softened by the fact Apple is a behemoth with strong fundamentals and brand loyalty, so it's unlikely to crash dramatically. This leads to a slightly higher than 50% chance of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and the broader market.  While Cramer dismisses Zuckerberg's assertion of a lack of innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs, this is not a strong bullish catalyst.  The article is largely a summary of Cramer's broader market commentary, including discussions on inflation, bonds,  Elon Musk, and AI stocks.  Cramer's mention of Apple is relatively brief and doesn't offer any specific positive or negative outlook for the company.  The overall tone suggests a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment towards the market in general, which might indirectly affect Apple's price. Given the lack of specific news about Apple's financial prospects or strategy,  the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively unchanged stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, indicating potential downward pressure. However, the provided content is minimal and lacks specific details (e.g., reasons for the bearish sentiment, such as weak earnings, regulatory issues, or market conditions). Without further context, the headline alone implies a higher probability of a fall than a rise, but the uncertainty is significant due to the lack of concrete information. Thus, the probability of a fall is moderately higher than a rise, but not extreme.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors may be shifting their focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (which includes Apple Inc.) and towards other S&P 500 stocks that could offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations. The article highlights that the financials sector is expected to have the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%, and that investors are looking for quality and growth in stocks. Apple's stock price has been underperforming this year, and with the market narrative shifting towards other sectors, there may be less attention and investment in Apple and other Mag 7 stocks. Additionally, with bond yields rising and expectations of potentially fewer Fed rate cuts, investors may be cautious about investing in tech stocks like Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the company's overall financial trajectory. Apple's ability to innovate and its strong brand loyalty will likely help the company navigate this change smoothly. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products may cause some users to express concern, but Apple's history of prioritizing user experience suggests that the company will find a way to maintain its high standards. Additionally, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may even lead to improvements in the Apple Card and Savings products. Therefore, while there may be some short-term volatility, the long-term prospects for AAPL remain strong.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple as a stock often recommended by Warren Buffett. While Apple's recent performance has shown stagnation, there are indications of potential growth with the launch of new AI-powered tools. The news provides a balanced view, mentioning both historical strengths and recent challenges. Given the strategic nature of Buffett's investments, there's a mixed sentiment but leaning towards optimism for growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline explicitly indicates that Apple's stock could face significant challenges this year, suggesting a negative outlook. This sentiment aligns with the prior predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of a price decline. Previous analyses highlight various pressures on Apple, such as investor sentiment shifting away from the 'Magnificent Seven', rising bond yields, and potential earnings slowdowns. Collectively, these factors contribute to a more pessimistic view of Apple\u2019s stock performance. Hence, I predict a higher likelihood of stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article suggests a shift in investor sentiment away from the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks with potentially better growth at reasonable valuations due to factors like rising bond yields and inflated tech expectations. While financials and other sectors are expected to show stronger growth, Apple's stock is already down YTD. This indicates downward pressure on Apple's stock. However, other's estimations are rather optimistic, thus, I will update my estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece is largely a summary of Jim Cramer's market commentary, with only a brief mention of Apple. Cramer's response to Zuckerberg's comment about Apple's innovation is neutral at best, neither strongly positive nor negative.  The lack of specific news regarding Apple's financial health or future strategy makes it unlikely that Cramer's comments alone will significantly impact the stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty around the impact of this news. Considering the lack of substantial information relating to AAPL's performance, and the fact that the overall market sentiment is a more significant factor than this specific news item, I'm assigning probabilities close to a neutral stance. However, given the prevailing uncertainty in the market and previous predictions slightly leaning towards a fall, I'm slightly weighting the probability towards a fall, but not substantially.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with the phrase 'could get hammered this year' indicating potential downward pressure. Previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, with probabilities of the stock price falling ranging from 0.4 to 0.75, and rising from 0.25 to 0.6. The most consistent theme across the models is the bearish sentiment due to factors like market shifts away from the 'Magnificent Seven', rising bond yields, and potential underperformance relative to other sectors. However, some models also highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty as mitigating factors. Given the overall negative tone of the headline and the consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a fall, but with some optimism due to Apple's resilience, the probabilities are weighted more towards a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks that may offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations. The article highlights that Apple's stock is down 8% year-to-date and that the 'Mag 7' names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, rising bond yields are cited as a headwind for the Mag 7. However, Apple is a large company with strong fundamentals and brand loyalty, which could mitigate a dramatic decline. Considering these factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but the company's strong brand loyalty, ability to innovate, and potential for finding a new partner could mitigate long-term negative impacts. The article suggests that Apple's ecosystem is robust and that the company will likely navigate this change smoothly. While there may be short-term volatility, the overall tone implies that Apple's financial trajectory will not be significantly altered. Considering the previous predictions, which showed a mix of sentiments with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling and others seeing it as less likely, the current news does not drastically alter the fundamental strengths of Apple. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, reflecting the potential for Apple to manage this change effectively and continue its long-term growth trajectory.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple as a stock often recommended by Warren Buffett. While Apple's recent performance has shown stagnation, there are indications of potential growth with the launch of new AI-powered tools. The news provides a balanced view, mentioning both historical strengths and recent challenges. Given the strategic nature of Buffett's investments, there's a mixed sentiment but leaning towards optimism for growth. Previous predictions from models were relatively varied, but many indicated a moderate expectation for a rise based on Apple's long-term strength and potential for growth in emerging areas like AI.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
