(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Goldman Sachs Eyes Early Apple Card Exit -- What It Means for Investors and Apple's Ecosystem\nNews Content: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple stock, stating that it 'could get hammered this year.' Generally, when a company receives negative news, it leads to pessimism among investors, which often results in a decrease in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is expected to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in market focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other opportunities within the S&P 500. Key points include: 1) Apple's stock is already down year-to-date (-8%); 2) The article highlights potentially faster earnings growth in the broader S&P 500 compared to the slowing growth of the Mag 7; 3) Rising bond yields are cited as a headwind for the Mag 7; 4) Analysts are suggesting looking at valuations outside of the 'Magnificent Seven'. All of these factors point towards downward pressure on Apple's stock. While not overtly negative towards Apple specifically, the overall tone implies underperformance relative to other sectors. However, the impact is likely softened by the fact Apple is a behemoth with strong fundamentals and brand loyalty, so it's unlikely to crash dramatically. This leads to a slightly higher than 50% chance of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and the broader market.  While Cramer dismisses Zuckerberg's assertion of a lack of innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs, this is not a strong bullish catalyst.  The article is largely a summary of Cramer's broader market commentary, including discussions on inflation, bonds,  Elon Musk, and AI stocks.  Cramer's mention of Apple is relatively brief and doesn't offer any specific positive or negative outlook for the company.  The overall tone suggests a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment towards the market in general, which might indirectly affect Apple's price. Given the lack of specific news about Apple's financial prospects or strategy,  the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively unchanged stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, indicating potential downward pressure. However, the provided content is minimal and lacks specific details (e.g., reasons for the bearish sentiment, such as weak earnings, regulatory issues, or market conditions). Without further context, the headline alone implies a higher probability of a fall than a rise, but the uncertainty is significant due to the lack of concrete information. Thus, the probability of a fall is moderately higher than a rise, but not extreme.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors may be shifting their focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (which includes Apple Inc.) and towards other S&P 500 stocks that could offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations. The article highlights that the financials sector is expected to have the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%, and that investors are looking for quality and growth in stocks. Apple's stock price has been underperforming this year, and with the market narrative shifting towards other sectors, there may be less attention and investment in Apple and other Mag 7 stocks. Additionally, with bond yields rising and expectations of potentially fewer Fed rate cuts, investors may be cautious about investing in tech stocks like Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL), but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the company's overall financial trajectory. Apple's ability to innovate and its strong brand loyalty will likely help the company navigate this change smoothly. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products may cause some users to express concern, but Apple's history of prioritizing user experience suggests that the company will find a way to maintain its high standards. Additionally, the possibility of a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may even lead to improvements in the Apple Card and Savings products. Therefore, while there may be some short-term volatility, the long-term prospects for AAPL remain strong.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple as a stock often recommended by Warren Buffett. While Apple's recent performance has shown stagnation, there are indications of potential growth with the launch of new AI-powered tools. The news provides a balanced view, mentioning both historical strengths and recent challenges. Given the strategic nature of Buffett's investments, there's a mixed sentiment but leaning towards optimism for growth.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
