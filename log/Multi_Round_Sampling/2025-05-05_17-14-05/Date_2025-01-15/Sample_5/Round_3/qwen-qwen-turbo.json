(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple stock, stating that it 'could get hammered this year.' Generally, pessimistic articles can lead to a decline in investor confidence, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the context of the news, it is reasonable to predict a lower likelihood of stock price rise and a higher likelihood of stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway (indicating Buffett's confidence), and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic. Despite the mixed signals, the overall tone is slightly positive due to Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives. This translates into a higher likelihood of a price rise in the short term than a price drop. The \"Double Down\" ad is generic and doesn't specifically recommend the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is likely to have a limited impact on Apple's stock price. While the Apple Card is part of Apple's ecosystem, it's not a major revenue driver for the company.  The article itself highlights that Apple's innovation and user-centric approach will likely mitigate any significant disruption to users.  The potential for a smooth transition to a new partner and the fact that Goldman Sachs's struggles are specific to their Platform Solutions unit (not indicative of Apple's overall financial health) reduces the likelihood of a substantial negative effect on AAPL's stock price. The news focuses more on the challenges faced by Goldman Sachs than on Apple, suggesting that the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal and temporary. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall, due to the potential for relatively minimal impact of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's recommended stocks, highlighting its timeless reputation and potential growth in the AI sector. However, it also notes stagnant revenue and sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple. The launch of an AI-powered tool and development of an AI processor chip could be positive catalysts, but the overall sentiment is mixed due to recent performance and strategic sell-offs by Buffett. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock, implying potential downward pressure on the stock price. Given the bearish tone of the headline, it's reasonable to infer that the news content may discuss challenges or potential setbacks for the company, which could lead to a decline in investor confidence and subsequently, the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc., including comments on innovation and market trends. Despite acknowledging the stock's strong track record and current valuation, Cramer's remarks suggest skepticism surrounding innovation post-Steve Jobs, which may negatively impact investor sentiment. The overall tone hints at potential challenges in continuing growth, especially as competition intensifies in the AI sector.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a strong negative outlook for Apple stock, which inherently leads to investor concern and reduced confidence in its future performance. Previous predictions reveal a consensus leaning towards pessimism, with the majority forecasting a higher probability of falling stock prices. The negative tone of the news suggests many investors may react by selling their shares, which contributes to a higher likelihood of price decline. Based on this and the trend of previous forecasts leaning heavily towards a price drop, I assess that the probability of the stock price falling is significantly greater than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Goldman Sachs's potential exit from the Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. While this could cause short-term market fluctuations, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited.  The Apple Card is not a major revenue driver for Apple, and the article suggests Apple's innovation and strong ecosystem will allow for a smooth transition to a new partner.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some models assigning a higher probability of a price rise and others predicting a price fall.  Considering the limited direct impact on Apple's core business and its ability to adapt, the probability of a stock price fall is lower than a price rise, though the impact is not expected to be significant.  The overall sentiment remains relatively neutral, leaning slightly positive due to Apple's resilience and adaptability. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a timeless stalwart with a strong reputation, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential growth in the AI sector with the launch of an AI-powered tool and development of an AI processor chip. On the negative side, it mentions stagnant revenue and sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, which could be seen as a lack of confidence. The overall sentiment is balanced but leans slightly positive due to the potential growth in AI and Buffett's continued large holding. Considering previous predictions, which also show a mixed but slightly positive outlook, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early could have a limited impact on Apple's stock price. While the Apple Card is part of Apple's ecosystem, it is not a major revenue driver for the company. The article highlights that Apple's innovation and user-centric approach will likely mitigate any significant disruption to users. The potential for a smooth transition to a new partner and the fact that Goldman Sachs's struggles are specific to their Platform Solutions unit (not indicative of Apple's overall financial health) reduce the likelihood of a substantial negative effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall, due to the potential for relatively minimal impact of this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a strongly negative outlook for Apple's stock, which typically leads to a decline in investor confidence and subsequently, the stock price. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment among the models, with some suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's innovation and potential growth in the AI sector, while others emphasize the negative impact of stagnant revenue, strategic sell-offs, and bearish market trends. However, the headline's bearish tone and the overall negative sentiment presented outweigh the positive aspects, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Considering the trend of others' beliefs and the mixed predictions, a conservative estimate leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling is reasonable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc., including comments on innovation and market trends from Jim Cramer. While the company retains a strong brand reputation and has had past successes, statements suggesting a lack of innovation post-Steve Jobs and potential challenges in the AI sector could negatively affect investor confidence. Several recent predictions have noted a cautious or slightly bearish outlook, although there are also elements that highlight the company's ongoing innovations and strengths.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline indicates a strong negative outlook for Apple Inc., with the phrase 'could get hammered' suggesting significant challenges ahead. Previous predictions support this bearish sentiment, with multiple models emphasizing a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to concerns about stagnant revenue, reduced investments, or sell-offs by significant stakeholders like Berkshire Hathaway. Despite some models highlighting potential growth opportunities in AI and Apple's strong brand, the prevailing sentiment from the news and previous predictions points towards a higher probability of downside risk. Therefore, based on the trends and sentiments observed, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple. It's framed within the context of 'Warren Buffett stocks', which is generally positive. It highlights Apple's status as a frequently suggested Buffett pick and its reputation for performance. However, it also mentions stagnant revenue, sales, and the fact that Berkshire Hathaway has been paring down it's Apple stake, while clarifying Buffett still holds a large stake. A significant positive factor is Apple's entry into the AI arena. Considering all sides, and accounting for potentially bullish market trends, the probability of a rise and fall are competitive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Goldman Sachs's potential exit from the Apple Card partnership, highlighting financial losses and regulatory issues for Goldman, not Apple. While this could cause short-term market fluctuations, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited. The Apple Card is not a core revenue driver for Apple.  Apple\u2019s history of innovation and its large, loyal customer base suggest it can navigate this transition effectively, mitigating any significant disruption.  The previous predictions are mixed, but lean slightly towards a price rise. Considering the relatively minor impact on Apple's core business and the company\u2019s ability to adapt, the probability of a stock price fall is lower than a rise, though the overall impact is expected to be minimal. The situation warrants a relatively neutral stance with a slight lean towards a price rise due to the company's inherent strengths.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a timeless stalwart with a strong reputation, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential growth in the AI sector with the launch of an AI-powered tool and development of an AI processor chip. On the negative side, it mentions stagnant revenue and sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, which could be seen as a lack of confidence.

Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment among the models, but the majority lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the trend of others' beliefs and the overall negative sentiment presented, a conservative estimate leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling is reasonable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc., as highlighted by Jim Cramer's comments. Cramer dismisses the notion of a lack of innovation post-Steve Jobs and points to Apple's continued market position and potential in AI. However, there is a cautious tone regarding the company's recent performances and the challenge posed by the AI-dominated market. Previous predictions have shown a generally cautious or bearish outlook with slight variations.
