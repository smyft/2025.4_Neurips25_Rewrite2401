(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Goldman Sachs Eyes Early Apple Card Exit -- What It Means for Investors and Apple's Ecosystem\nNews Content: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple stock, stating that it 'could get hammered this year.' Generally, pessimistic articles can lead to a decline in investor confidence, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the context of the news, it is reasonable to predict a lower likelihood of stock price rise and a higher likelihood of stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway (indicating Buffett's confidence), and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic. Despite the mixed signals, the overall tone is slightly positive due to Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives. This translates into a higher likelihood of a price rise in the short term than a price drop. The \"Double Down\" ad is generic and doesn't specifically recommend the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is likely to have a limited impact on Apple's stock price. While the Apple Card is part of Apple's ecosystem, it's not a major revenue driver for the company.  The article itself highlights that Apple's innovation and user-centric approach will likely mitigate any significant disruption to users.  The potential for a smooth transition to a new partner and the fact that Goldman Sachs's struggles are specific to their Platform Solutions unit (not indicative of Apple's overall financial health) reduces the likelihood of a substantial negative effect on AAPL's stock price. The news focuses more on the challenges faced by Goldman Sachs than on Apple, suggesting that the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal and temporary. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall, due to the potential for relatively minimal impact of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's recommended stocks, highlighting its timeless reputation and potential growth in the AI sector. However, it also notes stagnant revenue and sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple. The launch of an AI-powered tool and development of an AI processor chip could be positive catalysts, but the overall sentiment is mixed due to recent performance and strategic sell-offs by Buffett. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock, implying potential downward pressure on the stock price. Given the bearish tone of the headline, it's reasonable to infer that the news content may discuss challenges or potential setbacks for the company, which could lead to a decline in investor confidence and subsequently, the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc., including comments on innovation and market trends. Despite acknowledging the stock's strong track record and current valuation, Cramer's remarks suggest skepticism surrounding innovation post-Steve Jobs, which may negatively impact investor sentiment. The overall tone hints at potential challenges in continuing growth, especially as competition intensifies in the AI sector.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a strong negative outlook for Apple stock, which inherently leads to investor concern and reduced confidence in its future performance. Previous predictions reveal a consensus leaning towards pessimism, with the majority forecasting a higher probability of falling stock prices. The negative tone of the news suggests many investors may react by selling their shares, which contributes to a higher likelihood of price decline. Based on this and the trend of previous forecasts leaning heavily towards a price drop, I assess that the probability of the stock price falling is significantly greater than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Goldman Sachs's potential exit from the Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. While this could cause short-term market fluctuations, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited.  The Apple Card is not a major revenue driver for Apple, and the article suggests Apple's innovation and strong ecosystem will allow for a smooth transition to a new partner.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some models assigning a higher probability of a price rise and others predicting a price fall.  Considering the limited direct impact on Apple's core business and its ability to adapt, the probability of a stock price fall is lower than a price rise, though the impact is not expected to be significant.  The overall sentiment remains relatively neutral, leaning slightly positive due to Apple's resilience and adaptability. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a timeless stalwart with a strong reputation, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential growth in the AI sector with the launch of an AI-powered tool and development of an AI processor chip. On the negative side, it mentions stagnant revenue and sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, which could be seen as a lack of confidence. The overall sentiment is balanced but leans slightly positive due to the potential growth in AI and Buffett's continued large holding. Considering previous predictions, which also show a mixed but slightly positive outlook, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early could have a limited impact on Apple's stock price.

The potential for a smooth transition to a new partner and the fact that Goldman Sachs's struggles are specific to their Platform Solutions unit (not indicative of Apple's overall financial health) reduce the likelihood of a substantial negative effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall, due to the potential for relatively minimal impact of this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a strongly negative outlook for Apple's stock, which typically leads to a decline in investor confidence and subsequently, the stock price. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment among the models, with some suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's innovation and potential growth in the AI sector, while others emphasize the negative impact of stagnant revenue, strategic sell-offs, and bearish market trends. However, the headline's bearish tone and the overall negative sentiment presented outweigh the positive aspects, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Considering the trend of others' beliefs and the mixed predictions, a conservative estimate leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling is reasonable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc., including comments on innovation and market trends from Jim Cramer. While the company retains a strong brand reputation and has had past successes, statements suggesting a lack of innovation post-Steve Jobs and potential challenges in the AI sector could negatively affect investor confidence. Several recent predictions have noted a cautious or slightly bearish outlook, although there are also elements that highlight the company's ongoing innovations and strengths.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
