(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is managing its debt levels conservatively while showing strong cash flow and profitability. The company's low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and the fact that it generates robust free cash flow further signal financial stability. Given these factors, the overall sentiment towards the company's debt management is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation rather than depreciation. Thus, the probabilities reflect a strong expectation for the stock price to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in market focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other opportunities within the S&P 500. Key points include: 1) Apple's stock is already down year-to-date (-8%); 2) The article highlights potentially faster earnings growth in the other 493 S&P 500 companies; 3) It also mentions that expectations for Mag 7 earnings growth are slowing; 4) Rising bond yields are negatively affecting the Mag 7; and 5) BlackRock is advocating for investments in quality and growth at a reasonable price, which suggests some investors might be seeking bargains outside the Mag 7. The overall tone is that Apple might underperform relative to other stocks. There is a slight positive note as the IT sector (where Apple is) is projected for double digit profit growth. Given the negative sentiment towards the Mag 7, combined with some double digit growth, a moderate probability of the stock price to fall is assigned with a roughly equivalent probability for a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' is inherently bearish.  However, without the actual content of the article, a precise probability assessment is impossible.  The lack of specific information prevents a detailed analysis of the potential drivers behind a price drop.  Factors like the strength of Apple's product cycle, economic conditions, and competitive landscape are not considered.  Therefore, while the headline suggests a higher probability of a price fall, the absence of article content necessitates a cautious estimation.  A moderately bearish prediction is made based solely on the headline's negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily discuss Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs and broader market commentary. While Cramer's remarks could be seen as supportive of Apple, the overall tone of the news is neutral, focusing more on general market trends and other topics like TikTok, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg. The article does not provide any significant new financial data or catalysts specific to Apple that would strongly influence its stock price. Given the mixed performance of Apple's stock recently (down 4.3% YTD in 2025) and the lack of concrete positive or negative news, the impact of this article on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral nature of the news and the absence of strong directional signals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article mentions that Buffett and his lieutenants have been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple, it also notes that Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position. The article highlights Apple's potential for growth, particularly with its AI-powered tool and processor chip development. However, the recent stagnation in revenue and iPhone sales could be a concern. Overall, the article presents a neutral to positive view of Apple's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks instead of the 'Mag 7' stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article cites that the 'Mag 7' names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024, and that the 493 other stocks could post an 11% earnings growth this year. Additionally, the article mentions that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. Considering this information, it seems that the article is not very positive about the 'Mag 7' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and is instead suggesting that investors look into other stocks. Therefore, the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is relatively high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt. Apple has shown a minimal net debt load, strong cash reserves, and robust EBIT margins, which indicate a company in a strong financial position. These factors suggest that the company can comfortably manage its debt burden, leading to reduced financial risks and improved investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. is managing its debt conservatively, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage. This suggests the company is in a strong financial position, capable of meeting its obligations without significant risk. While there are some negative sentiments around the broader market performance of 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, Apple\u2019s solid cash flow and profitability counterbalance these concerns. Therefore, despite some caution in the market, the overall financial health and performance of Apple suggest a stronger likelihood of stock price appreciation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests a negative outlook for the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple. The article highlights that these stocks might not be the best investment choice currently, with expectations of slower earnings growth compared to other S&P 500 stocks. Specifically, Apple is already down 8% year-to-date. While other models in Round 0 showed a mixed sentiment on Apple's outlook, there seems to be a consensus in general that the stock might underperform relative to the broader market indicated, leading to a slightly increased probability of a price decrease this time.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is inherently bearish, immediately suggesting a higher probability of a price drop.  However, the lack of article content prevents a definitive assessment. The previous predictions are mixed, with some models favoring a price rise (0.75 probability by gpt-4o-mini) based on Apple's strong financial position and others significantly favoring a price fall (0.7 probability by gemini-flash-1.5 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) due to concerns about market shifts away from the 'Magnificent Seven' and slower earnings growth expectations.  The wide divergence highlights the uncertainty and suggests that the headline alone is insufficient for a strong prediction.  Considering the bearish headline and the range of previous predictions, I assign a moderately higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging significant uncertainty. The mixed opinions from prior models reflect the complex factors affecting Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs and broader market commentary. While Cramer's remarks could be seen as supportive of Apple, the overall tone of the news is neutral, focusing more on general market trends and other topics like TikTok, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg. The article does not provide any significant new financial data or catalysts specific to Apple that would strongly influence its stock price. Given the mixed performance of Apple's stock recently (down 4.3% YTD in 2025) and the lack of concrete positive or negative news, the impact of this article on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral nature of the news and the absence of strong directional signals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
