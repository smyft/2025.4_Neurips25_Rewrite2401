(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is managing its debt levels conservatively while showing strong cash flow and profitability. The company's low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and the fact that it generates robust free cash flow further signal financial stability. Given these factors, the overall sentiment towards the company's debt management is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation rather than depreciation. Thus, the probabilities reflect a strong expectation for the stock price to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in market focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other opportunities within the S&P 500. Key points include: 1) Apple's stock is already down year-to-date (-8%); 2) The article highlights potentially faster earnings growth in the other 493 S&P 500 companies; 3) It also mentions that expectations for Mag 7 earnings growth are slowing; 4) Rising bond yields are negatively affecting the Mag 7; and 5) BlackRock is advocating for investments in quality and growth at a reasonable price, which suggests some investors might be seeking bargains outside the Mag 7. The overall tone is that Apple might underperform relative to other stocks. There is a slight positive note as the IT sector (where Apple is) is projected for double digit profit growth. Given the negative sentiment towards the Mag 7, combined with some double digit growth, a moderate probability of the stock price to fall is assigned with a roughly equivalent probability for a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' is inherently bearish.  However, without the actual content of the article, a precise probability assessment is impossible.  The lack of specific information prevents a detailed analysis of the potential drivers behind a price drop.  Factors like the strength of Apple's product cycle, economic conditions, and competitive landscape are not considered.  Therefore, while the headline suggests a higher probability of a price fall, the absence of article content necessitates a cautious estimation.  A moderately bearish prediction is made based solely on the headline's negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily discuss Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs and broader market commentary. While Cramer's remarks could be seen as supportive of Apple, the overall tone of the news is neutral, focusing more on general market trends and other topics like TikTok, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg. The article does not provide any significant new financial data or catalysts specific to Apple that would strongly influence its stock price. Given the mixed performance of Apple's stock recently (down 4.3% YTD in 2025) and the lack of concrete positive or negative news, the impact of this article on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral nature of the news and the absence of strong directional signals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article mentions that Buffett and his lieutenants have been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple, it also notes that Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position. The article highlights Apple's potential for growth, particularly with its AI-powered tool and processor chip development. However, the recent stagnation in revenue and iPhone sales could be a concern. Overall, the article presents a neutral to positive view of Apple's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks instead of the 'Mag 7' stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article cites that the 'Mag 7' names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024, and that the 493 other stocks could post an 11% earnings growth this year. Additionally, the article mentions that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. Considering this information, it seems that the article is not very positive about the 'Mag 7' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and is instead suggesting that investors look into other stocks. Therefore, the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of the stock price falling is relatively high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt. Apple has shown a minimal net debt load, strong cash reserves, and robust EBIT margins, which indicate a company in a strong financial position. These factors suggest that the company can comfortably manage its debt burden, leading to reduced financial risks and improved investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. is managing its debt conservatively, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage. This suggests the company is in a strong financial position, capable of meeting its obligations without significant risk. While there are some negative sentiments around the broader market performance of 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, Apple\u2019s solid cash flow and profitability counterbalance these concerns. Therefore, despite some caution in the market, the overall financial health and performance of Apple suggest a stronger likelihood of stock price appreciation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests a negative outlook for the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple. The article highlights that these stocks might not be the best investment choice currently, with expectations of slower earnings growth compared to other S&P 500 stocks. Specifically, Apple is already down 8% year-to-date. While other models in Round 0 showed a mixed sentiment on Apple's outlook, there seems to be a consensus in general that the stock might underperform relative to the broader market indicated, leading to a slightly increased probability of a price decrease this time.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is inherently bearish, immediately suggesting a higher probability of a price drop.  However, the lack of article content prevents a definitive assessment. The previous predictions are mixed, with some models favoring a price rise (0.75 probability by gpt-4o-mini) based on Apple's strong financial position and others significantly favoring a price fall (0.7 probability by gemini-flash-1.5 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) due to concerns about market shifts away from the 'Magnificent Seven' and slower earnings growth expectations.  The wide divergence highlights the uncertainty and suggests that the headline alone is insufficient for a strong prediction.  Considering the bearish headline and the range of previous predictions, I assign a moderately higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging significant uncertainty. The mixed opinions from prior models reflect the complex factors affecting Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs and broader market commentary. While Cramer's remarks could be seen as supportive of Apple, the overall tone of the news is neutral, focusing more on general market trends and other topics like TikTok, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg. The article does not provide any significant new financial data or catalysts specific to Apple that would strongly influence its stock price. Given the mixed performance of Apple's stock recently (down 4.3% YTD in 2025) and the lack of concrete positive or negative news, the impact of this article on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral nature of the news and the absence of strong directional signals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks instead of the 'Mag 7' stocks, which include Apple Inc.

The previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with some predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling.
