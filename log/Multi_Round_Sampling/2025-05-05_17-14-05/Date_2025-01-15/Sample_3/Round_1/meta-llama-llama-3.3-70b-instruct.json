(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Goldman Sachs Eyes Early Apple Card Exit -- What It Means for Investors and Apple's Ecosystem\nNews Content: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. Apple has already seen a decline in its stock price year-to-date, and the broader market sentiment seems cautious due to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic outlook. Thus, there is a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price falling compared to rising in the current environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple carries a significant amount of debt, it is comfortably manageable due to the company's large cash reserves, strong earnings, and robust free cash flow. Key ratios like net debt to EBITDA and interest cover indicate a very conservative use of debt. Additionally, Apple's increasing EBIT and the high conversion of EBIT to free cash flow further alleviate any debt-related concerns. The article concludes that Apple's sensible leverage can potentially boost returns on equity. Therefore, the news is likely to be perceived positively by investors, increasing the likelihood of a stock price increase. However, markets are complex, and external economic conditions not cited in this article could negatively impact price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and its innovation, contrasting it with other companies and broader market trends.  While Cramer dismisses criticism of Apple's innovation slowdown as 'inflammatory', the article also highlights investor concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the iPhone's sustained sales momentum.  The overall tone suggests a mixed outlook, with Cramer's defense of Apple somewhat counterbalanced by the article's mention of investor uncertainty.  The article's promotion of other AI stocks as potentially more profitable further suggests a less bullish outlook for Apple in the short term. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish outlook is more likely. The broader macroeconomic discussion about inflation and bond markets is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific stock movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, citing potential overvaluation and slowing earnings growth in the Mag 7. Apple's stock (AAPL) is specifically mentioned as being down 8% year-to-date, which could indicate negative sentiment. The article highlights that financials and other sectors may offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations, potentially diverting investment away from tech giants like Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and a high interest coverage ratio of 673 times. The company's ability to generate free cash flow amounting to 90% of its EBIT also indicates a strong position to manage its debt. Overall, the article presents a positive view of Apple's financial health and debt management, which is likely to boost investor confidence and potentially lead to a rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may lead to a short-term disruption for Apple's financial services, but Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company can navigate this challenge. The potential disruption to Apple's Apple Card and Savings products may lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence, but the overall impact on Apple's ecosystem is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates Goldman Sachs may exit its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, which has been associated with significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. While Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, their track record for user-first innovation suggests they can navigate any potential issues smoothly. Goldman's overall business performance remains strong but faces operational shifts away from its Platform Solutions. This news might cause short-term investor uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
