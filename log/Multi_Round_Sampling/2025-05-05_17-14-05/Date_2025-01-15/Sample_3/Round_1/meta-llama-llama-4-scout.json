(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. Apple has already seen a decline in its stock price year-to-date, and the broader market sentiment seems cautious due to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic outlook. Thus, there is a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price falling compared to rising in the current environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple carries a significant amount of debt, it is comfortably manageable due to the company's large cash reserves, strong earnings, and robust free cash flow. Key ratios like net debt to EBITDA and interest cover indicate a very conservative use of debt. Additionally, Apple's increasing EBIT and the high conversion of EBIT to free cash flow further alleviate any debt-related concerns. The article concludes that Apple's sensible leverage can potentially boost returns on equity. Therefore, the news is likely to be perceived positively by investors, increasing the likelihood of a stock price increase. However, markets are complex, and external economic conditions not cited in this article could negatively impact price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and its innovation, contrasting it with other companies and broader market trends.  While Cramer dismisses criticism of Apple's innovation slowdown as 'inflammatory', the article also highlights investor concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the iPhone's sustained sales momentum.  The overall tone suggests a mixed outlook, with Cramer's defense of Apple somewhat counterbalanced by the article's mention of investor uncertainty.  The article's promotion of other AI stocks as potentially more profitable further suggests a less bullish outlook for Apple in the short term. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish outlook is more likely. The broader macroeconomic discussion about inflation and bond markets is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific stock movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, citing potential overvaluation and slowing earnings growth in the Mag 7. Apple's stock (AAPL) is specifically mentioned as being down 8% year-to-date, which could indicate negative sentiment. The article highlights that financials and other sectors may offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations, potentially diverting investment away from tech giants like Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and a high interest coverage ratio of 673 times. The company's ability to generate free cash flow amounting to 90% of its EBIT also indicates a strong position to manage its debt. Overall, the article presents a positive view of Apple's financial health and debt management, which is likely to boost investor confidence and potentially lead to a rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may lead to a short-term disruption for Apple's financial services, but Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company can navigate this challenge. The potential disruption to Apple's Apple Card and Savings products may lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence, but the overall impact on Apple's ecosystem is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates Goldman Sachs may exit its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, which has been associated with significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. While Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, their track record for user-first innovation suggests they can navigate any potential issues smoothly. Goldman's overall business performance remains strong but faces operational shifts away from its Platform Solutions. This news might cause short-term investor uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
