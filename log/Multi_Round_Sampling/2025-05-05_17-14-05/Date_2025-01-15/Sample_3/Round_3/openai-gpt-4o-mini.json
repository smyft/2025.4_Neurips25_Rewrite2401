(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. Apple has already seen a decline in its stock price year-to-date, and the broader market sentiment seems cautious due to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic outlook. Thus, there is a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price falling compared to rising in the current environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple carries a significant amount of debt, it is comfortably manageable due to the company's large cash reserves, strong earnings, and robust free cash flow. Key ratios like net debt to EBITDA and interest cover indicate a very conservative use of debt. Additionally, Apple's increasing EBIT and the high conversion of EBIT to free cash flow further alleviate any debt-related concerns. The article concludes that Apple's sensible leverage can potentially boost returns on equity. Therefore, the news is likely to be perceived positively by investors, increasing the likelihood of a stock price increase. However, markets are complex, and external economic conditions not cited in this article could negatively impact price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and its innovation, contrasting it with other companies and broader market trends.  While Cramer dismisses criticism of Apple's innovation slowdown as 'inflammatory', the article also highlights investor concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the iPhone's sustained sales momentum.  The overall tone suggests a mixed outlook, with Cramer's defense of Apple somewhat counterbalanced by the article's mention of investor uncertainty.  The article's promotion of other AI stocks as potentially more profitable further suggests a less bullish outlook for Apple in the short term. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish outlook is more likely. The broader macroeconomic discussion about inflation and bond markets is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific stock movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, citing potential overvaluation and slowing earnings growth in the Mag 7. Apple's stock (AAPL) is specifically mentioned as being down 8% year-to-date, which could indicate negative sentiment. The article highlights that financials and other sectors may offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations, potentially diverting investment away from tech giants like Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and a high interest coverage ratio of 673 times. The company's ability to generate free cash flow amounting to 90% of its EBIT also indicates a strong position to manage its debt. Overall, the article presents a positive view of Apple's financial health and debt management, which is likely to boost investor confidence and potentially lead to a rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may lead to a short-term disruption for Apple's financial services, but Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company can navigate this challenge. The potential disruption to Apple's Apple Card and Savings products may lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence, but the overall impact on Apple's ecosystem is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates Goldman Sachs may exit its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, which has been associated with significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. While Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, their track record for user-first innovation suggests they can navigate any potential issues smoothly. Goldman's overall business performance remains strong but faces operational shifts away from its Platform Solutions. This news might cause short-term investor uncertainty.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a shift in investor appetite away from the Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, towards other sectors of the S&P 500. Apple's stock has already experienced a year-to-date decline of 8%, and the potential for lower earnings growth compared to other sectors raises concerns. The emphasis on finding value and growth outside the large tech stocks suggests a bearish sentiment towards Apple. Coupled with the rising bond yields and changes in market dynamics, this indicates a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the near term compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive analysis of Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative approach and strong financial health. Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high-interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest Apple can comfortably handle its debt obligations. While liabilities outweigh short-term assets, Apple's immense market capitalization renders this manageable. Considering this positive assessment and integrating the historical predictions, a slight upward revision of probability scores is warranted. Notably, earlier predictions based on other new sources have varied from primarily rising to prdominantly falling. Since the current news seems to be predominantly positive, it warrants a further update to the stock price rising probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news piece is largely focused on Jim Cramer's opinions and broader market commentary, with only tangential relevance to Apple's stock price. Cramer's defense of Apple against criticism of its innovation is mildly positive, but doesn't offer compelling reasons for a significant price increase. The mention of investor concerns regarding Apple's AI strategy and iPhone sales momentum introduces a countervailing bearish sentiment.  The article's emphasis on other, potentially more promising AI stocks further suggests a neutral to slightly bearish outlook for Apple in the short term. The macroeconomic factors discussed (inflation, bond yields) are not directly linked to Apple's specific situation and are too broad to inform a precise prediction based solely on this news. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of substantial, Apple-specific news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the overall cautious sentiment and the uncertainty around Apple's AI strategy.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, further suggesting uncertainty. My prediction leans towards the less optimistic assessments, giving more weight to the inherent risks and uncertainties mentioned in the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. Apple's stock has already declined by 8% year-to-date, indicating negative sentiment. The article highlights potential better opportunities in other sectors like financials, which could divert investment away from Apple. Given this context and the broader market caution due to macroeconomic factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling appears higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, a move that has led to significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. Apple, known for its innovation and ability to adapt, may face short-term disruptions in its Apple Card and Savings products; however, it has shown resilience in past transitions. The broader picture of Apple's strong financial health, including debt management and free cash flow, counters some negative sentiments. Other models predict mixed outcomes, leaning slightly negative. Given the mixed signals, a modest probability of decline is considered.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article highlights a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other sectors of the S&P 500, indicating potential challenges for Apple in maintaining investor enthusiasm. The mention of rising bond yields and a declining year-to-date performance for Apple (down 8%) further contributes to a cautious outlook. Additionally, earnings growth for Apple may slow compared to other sectors, which could lead to decreased investor appetite. While Apple's financial health is strong, the overall market sentiment appears to lean negative towards the stock in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article emphasizes Apple's prudent debt management, characterized by a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high-interest coverage. The company's robust free cash flow further strengthens its financial position. While the balance sheet reveals significant liabilities, these are deemed manageable given Apple's substantial market capitalization. Overall, the article conveys a positive assessment of Apple's financial health. Considering this positive news and acknowledging the mixed sentiments expressed in previous rounds, I predict a higher probability of a stock price increase. Several previous rounds mixed between negative and positive sentiments. A gemini model gives pretty high rating in the previous rounds, which weights more in this prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news piece is primarily focused on Jim Cramer's commentary, which offers a mixed outlook on Apple. While he defends Apple against criticisms of its innovation, the article also highlights lingering investor concerns about Apple's AI strategy and iPhone sales.  The promotion of other AI stocks as potentially better investments further suggests a less bullish near-term view for Apple. The macroeconomic factors discussed are too broad to significantly impact the prediction based solely on this specific news.  Previous predictions show significant divergence, ranging from strongly bullish to strongly bearish. This further highlights the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement in response to this particular news. Considering the mixed signals, the relatively neutral tone of Cramer's comments and the lack of significant positive news directly related to Apple, I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the overall cautious sentiment and uncertain outlook. However, given Apple's overall strength, a significant decline is unlikely. This prediction integrates the mixed opinions from previous rounds, acknowledging uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. Apple's stock has already declined by 8% year-to-date, indicating negative sentiment. The article highlights better opportunities in other sectors like financials, which could divert investment away from Apple. Given this context and broader market caution due to macroeconomic factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling appears higher than it rising in the short term. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline. Therefore, the analysis suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative approach and strong financial health. Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high-interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest Apple can comfortably handle its debt obligations. However, Apple's stock has already experienced a year-to-date decline of 8%, and there are concerns about its AI strategy and iPhone sales momentum. The broader market sentiment seems cautious due to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic outlook. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of Apple's stock price rising seems higher than falling, given its strong financials and manageable debt.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may lead to short-term disruptions for Apple's financial services, but Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt suggests that the company can navigate this challenge. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the potential for a smooth transition, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the uncertainty and potential disruptions. However, the overall impact on Apple's ecosystem is expected to be minimal, and the company's strong financial health counters some negative sentiments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, a move that has led to significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman.
