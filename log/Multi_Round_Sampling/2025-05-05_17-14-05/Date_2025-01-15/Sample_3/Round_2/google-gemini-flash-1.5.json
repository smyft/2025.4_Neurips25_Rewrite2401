(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. Apple has already seen a decline in its stock price year-to-date, and the broader market sentiment seems cautious due to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic outlook. Thus, there is a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price falling compared to rising in the current environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple carries a significant amount of debt, it is comfortably manageable due to the company's large cash reserves, strong earnings, and robust free cash flow. Key ratios like net debt to EBITDA and interest cover indicate a very conservative use of debt. Additionally, Apple's increasing EBIT and the high conversion of EBIT to free cash flow further alleviate any debt-related concerns. The article concludes that Apple's sensible leverage can potentially boost returns on equity. Therefore, the news is likely to be perceived positively by investors, increasing the likelihood of a stock price increase. However, markets are complex, and external economic conditions not cited in this article could negatively impact price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and its innovation, contrasting it with other companies and broader market trends.  While Cramer dismisses criticism of Apple's innovation slowdown as 'inflammatory', the article also highlights investor concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the iPhone's sustained sales momentum.  The overall tone suggests a mixed outlook, with Cramer's defense of Apple somewhat counterbalanced by the article's mention of investor uncertainty.  The article's promotion of other AI stocks as potentially more profitable further suggests a less bullish outlook for Apple in the short term. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish outlook is more likely. The broader macroeconomic discussion about inflation and bond markets is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific stock movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, citing potential overvaluation and slowing earnings growth in the Mag 7. Apple's stock (AAPL) is specifically mentioned as being down 8% year-to-date, which could indicate negative sentiment. The article highlights that financials and other sectors may offer better growth opportunities at reasonable valuations, potentially diverting investment away from tech giants like Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and a high interest coverage ratio of 673 times. The company's ability to generate free cash flow amounting to 90% of its EBIT also indicates a strong position to manage its debt. Overall, the article presents a positive view of Apple's financial health and debt management, which is likely to boost investor confidence and potentially lead to a rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may lead to a short-term disruption for Apple's financial services, but Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company can navigate this challenge. The potential disruption to Apple's Apple Card and Savings products may lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence, but the overall impact on Apple's ecosystem is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates Goldman Sachs may exit its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, which has been associated with significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. While Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, their track record for user-first innovation suggests they can navigate any potential issues smoothly. Goldman's overall business performance remains strong but faces operational shifts away from its Platform Solutions. This news might cause short-term investor uncertainty.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a shift in investor appetite away from the Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, towards other sectors of the S&P 500. Apple's stock has already experienced a year-to-date decline of 8%, and the potential for lower earnings growth compared to other sectors raises concerns. The emphasis on finding value and growth outside the large tech stocks suggests a bearish sentiment towards Apple. Coupled with the rising bond yields and changes in market dynamics, this indicates a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the near term compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive analysis of Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative approach and strong financial health. Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high-interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest Apple can comfortably handle its debt obligations. While liabilities outweigh short-term assets, Apple's immense market capitalization renders this manageable. Considering this positive assessment and integrating the historical predictions, a slight upward revision of probability scores is warranted. Notably, earlier predictions based on other new sources have varied from primarily rising to prdominantly falling. Since the current news seems to be predominantly positive, it warrants a further update to the stock price rising probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news piece is largely focused on Jim Cramer's opinions and broader market commentary, with only tangential relevance to Apple's stock price. Cramer's defense of Apple against criticism of its innovation is mildly positive, but doesn't offer compelling reasons for a significant price increase. The mention of investor concerns regarding Apple's AI strategy and iPhone sales momentum introduces a countervailing bearish sentiment.  The article's emphasis on other, potentially more promising AI stocks further suggests a neutral to slightly bearish outlook for Apple in the short term. The macroeconomic factors discussed (inflation, bond yields) are not directly linked to Apple's specific situation and are too broad to inform a precise prediction based solely on this news. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of substantial, Apple-specific news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the overall cautious sentiment and the uncertainty around Apple's AI strategy.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, further suggesting uncertainty. My prediction leans towards the less optimistic assessments, giving more weight to the inherent risks and uncertainties mentioned in the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. Apple's stock has already declined by 8% year-to-date, indicating negative sentiment. The article highlights potential better opportunities in other sectors like financials, which could divert investment away from Apple. Given this context and the broader market caution due to macroeconomic factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling appears higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, a move that has led to significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. Apple, known for its innovation and ability to adapt, may face short-term disruptions in its Apple Card and Savings products; however, it has shown resilience in past transitions. The broader picture of Apple's strong financial health, including debt management and free cash flow, counters some negative sentiments. Other models predict mixed outcomes, leaning slightly negative. Given the mixed signals, a modest probability of decline is considered.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
