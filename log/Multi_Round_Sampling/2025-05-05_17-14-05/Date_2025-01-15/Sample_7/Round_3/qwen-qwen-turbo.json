(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Goldman Sachs Eyes Early Apple Card Exit -- What It Means for Investors and Apple's Ecosystem\nNews Content: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. While Apple has been previously negatively impacted by these factors, there is also mention of broader opportunities in financials and other sectors that might offer growth. Given that Apple is part of the Mag 7, which has underperformed recently and is facing pressures from macroeconomic factors, this suggests a higher probability of stock price decline in the short term. However, overall market dynamics could still lead to some relative resilience. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is assessed to be higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple does carry debt, it's at a manageable level and is used sparingly and effectively. Key points supporting this include: low net debt to EBITDA ratio, extremely high interest coverage, robust free cash flow generation relative to EBIT, and a decrease from 1 year before. The article concludes that Apple uses debt quite reasonably and that sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. While a small increase in EBIT doesn't scream rapid improvements. This combined with the general view, it is more likely to be positive than negative. However, potential warning signs are also mentioned meaning investors should still be wary. This is not considered likely to trigger a large positive or negative impact alone.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and its innovation, contrasting it with other companies and broader market trends.  Cramer's statement that claims about a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs are 'inflammatory' is a mild positive sentiment towards Apple. However, the article's overall tone is neutral to slightly negative regarding Apple's prospects in the AI sector compared to other companies. The article highlights the general uncertainty around Apple's AI strategy and future performance, suggesting competitiveness concerns relative to other player rather than focusing on specific financial figures or announcements.  Considering the lack of strong positive or negative news impacting Apple directly, the probability of a price change in either direction based on this news alone is relatively low.  The broader market commentary discussed in the piece is largely unrelated to Apple's specific performance and therefore has little effect on probability calculations for Apple stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on his reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's statement about Apple's lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer defends Apple's innovation and integration, the broader context includes mixed performance in the AI era and concerns about iPhone sales momentum. The article does not provide significant new financial data or groundbreaking news that would strongly influence Apple's stock price. However, the defense of Apple's innovation by a prominent figure like Cramer could provide slight positive sentiment. Given the lack of substantial catalysts in the news, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a neutral or minor positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and his response to criticism about the company's innovation since Steve Jobs' era. Cramer seems to defend Apple, suggesting that the criticism is unfounded and expressing his familiarity and integration with Apple products. This positive stance from a notable financial commentator could boost investor confidence. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's performance and its position among the stocks discussed by Cramer, but it does not provide direct negative commentary on the company's prospects. However, it also mentions that Cramer's discussion does not directly imply a significant positive impact on the stock price. Given Cramer's influence and the neutral to slightly positive tone regarding Apple, there's a moderate chance the stock price could rise. However, the overall market performance, economic factors, and competition in the tech industry also play crucial roles in determining Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other stocks. Cramer finds the statement that there's been no innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs' death 'inflammatory'. This suggests a somewhat positive sentiment towards Apple. However, the article also mentions that Apple's shares are down 4.3% year-to-date in 2025, and there are concerns about the company's ability to push AI to consumers and sustain iPhone sales momentum. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but overall, the impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates Goldman Sachs may exit its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, which has been associated with significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. While Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, their track record for user-first innovation suggests they can navigate any potential issues smoothly. Goldman's overall business performance remains strong but faces operational shifts away from its Platform Solutions. This news might cause short-term investor uncertainty.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, due to concerns about slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields, leading to a bearish sentiment. While there are mentions of healthy growth opportunities in other sectors and quality investments, the context suggests a challenging environment for Apple, which is part of the declining group. Previous predictions varied, with some indicating moderate support for growth based on factors like debt management but overall, recent trends and expectations show elevated risks for the stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price decline than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative approach and strong financial health. Key indicators such as low net debt to EBITDA ratio, extremely high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation support this assessment. Although the article mentions potential risks existing outside of the balance sheet, the overall tone is reassuring regarding Apple's ability to manage its debt effectively. Considering this positive assessment coupled with the trend in the previous rounds and the fact that most agents considered previous news to have a minor + effect or a neutral effect, I think this new report, combined with the opinions of the previous rounds, will have a positive effect to the stock. Therefore, a slightly increased probability of the stock price rising is indicated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against claims of stagnant innovation since Steve Jobs.  While Cramer's positive comments offer a slight boost to sentiment, the article also highlights existing concerns about Apple's AI strategy, iPhone sales, and overall market performance.  These counterbalancing factors prevent a strong bullish or bearish prediction. The previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities ranging from 0.35 to 0.6 for a price rise and 0.4 to 0.65 for a price fall. This diversity further supports the conclusion that the news itself doesn't provide a decisive directional signal. Considering the mixed sentiment and lack of substantial new information impacting Apple's fundamentals, the probabilities lean towards a neutral stance with only a slight edge towards a price rise given Cramer's generally positive comments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he defends the company against claims of no innovation since Steve Jobs' era.

Considering these mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but overall, the impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be minimal. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with a slight tilt towards a neutral or minor positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, but given their historical ability to innovate and adapt, the impact might be mitigated. Other predictions show varied sentiments but tend to suggest minor impacts. Considering the mixed signals and the overall market dynamics, there is a moderate expectation that the stock price could see slight volatility.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, due to concerns regarding slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. This suggests a bearish sentiment towards Apple, particularly in the context of recent underperformance of the 'Mag 7.' While there are positive aspects such as strong overall sector growth and investment opportunities in other stocks, the focus on Apple's declining trajectory and the potential impact of external economic factors leads to a higher probability for a price decline than a rise. Thus, the predicted probabilities reflect this overall cautious sentiment for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's conservative and effective use of debt, highlighting its strong financial health with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow. This positive assessment, coupled with the consistent prior predictions, many pointing towards a neutral to slightly positive sentiment regarding previous news, suggests a likely positive impact to the stock price. While it's important to heed the warning signs and be aware of external risks, the overwhelming message is one of financial stability. Previously, there has been indecision about its innovation and the mixed opinions on the GS Apple Card situation. However, the debt situation looks good.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece centers on Jim Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation against recent criticism. While this is a mildly positive sentiment, the article also highlights ongoing concerns about Apple's AI strategy, iPhone sales, and broader market factors.  The lack of strong, concrete positive news about Apple's financials or product announcements means the overall impact is likely minimal.  Analysis of previous predictions reveals a wide range of probabilities, from 0.35 to 0.65 for a price rise and 0.4 to 0.65 for a price fall. This divergence suggests the Cramer comments alone aren't a decisive factor in predicting stock price movement.  Considering this lack of a clear directional signal and the mixed sentiments, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the mildly positive sentiment, but only marginally, as the overall impact is expected to be muted.  The probabilities lean towards neutral, with the previous predictions offering a good guide.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.
