(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. While Apple has been previously negatively impacted by these factors, there is also mention of broader opportunities in financials and other sectors that might offer growth. Given that Apple is part of the Mag 7, which has underperformed recently and is facing pressures from macroeconomic factors, this suggests a higher probability of stock price decline in the short term. However, overall market dynamics could still lead to some relative resilience. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is assessed to be higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple does carry debt, it's at a manageable level and is used sparingly and effectively. Key points supporting this include: low net debt to EBITDA ratio, extremely high interest coverage, robust free cash flow generation relative to EBIT, and a decrease from 1 year before. The article concludes that Apple uses debt quite reasonably and that sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. While a small increase in EBIT doesn't scream rapid improvements. This combined with the general view, it is more likely to be positive than negative. However, potential warning signs are also mentioned meaning investors should still be wary. This is not considered likely to trigger a large positive or negative impact alone.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and its innovation, contrasting it with other companies and broader market trends.  Cramer's statement that claims about a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs are 'inflammatory' is a mild positive sentiment towards Apple. However, the article's overall tone is neutral to slightly negative regarding Apple's prospects in the AI sector compared to other companies. The article highlights the general uncertainty around Apple's AI strategy and future performance, suggesting competitiveness concerns relative to other player rather than focusing on specific financial figures or announcements.  Considering the lack of strong positive or negative news impacting Apple directly, the probability of a price change in either direction based on this news alone is relatively low.  The broader market commentary discussed in the piece is largely unrelated to Apple's specific performance and therefore has little effect on probability calculations for Apple stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on his reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's statement about Apple's lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer defends Apple's innovation and integration, the broader context includes mixed performance in the AI era and concerns about iPhone sales momentum. The article does not provide significant new financial data or groundbreaking news that would strongly influence Apple's stock price. However, the defense of Apple's innovation by a prominent figure like Cramer could provide slight positive sentiment. Given the lack of substantial catalysts in the news, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a neutral or minor positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and his response to criticism about the company's innovation since Steve Jobs' era. Cramer seems to defend Apple, suggesting that the criticism is unfounded and expressing his familiarity and integration with Apple products. This positive stance from a notable financial commentator could boost investor confidence. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's performance and its position among the stocks discussed by Cramer, but it does not provide direct negative commentary on the company's prospects. However, it also mentions that Cramer's discussion does not directly imply a significant positive impact on the stock price. Given Cramer's influence and the neutral to slightly positive tone regarding Apple, there's a moderate chance the stock price could rise. However, the overall market performance, economic factors, and competition in the tech industry also play crucial roles in determining Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other stocks. Cramer finds the statement that there's been no innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs' death 'inflammatory'. This suggests a somewhat positive sentiment towards Apple. However, the article also mentions that Apple's shares are down 4.3% year-to-date in 2025, and there are concerns about the company's ability to push AI to consumers and sustain iPhone sales momentum. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but overall, the impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates Goldman Sachs may exit its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, which has been associated with significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. While Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, their track record for user-first innovation suggests they can navigate any potential issues smoothly. Goldman's overall business performance remains strong but faces operational shifts away from its Platform Solutions. This news might cause short-term investor uncertainty.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, due to concerns about slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields, leading to a bearish sentiment. While there are mentions of healthy growth opportunities in other sectors and quality investments, the context suggests a challenging environment for Apple, which is part of the declining group. Previous predictions varied, with some indicating moderate support for growth based on factors like debt management but overall, recent trends and expectations show elevated risks for the stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price decline than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative approach and strong financial health. Key indicators such as low net debt to EBITDA ratio, extremely high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation support this assessment. Although the article mentions potential risks existing outside of the balance sheet, the overall tone is reassuring regarding Apple's ability to manage its debt effectively. Considering this positive assessment coupled with the trend in the previous rounds and the fact that most agents considered previous news to have a minor + effect or a neutral effect, I think this new report, combined with the opinions of the previous rounds, will have a positive effect to the stock. Therefore, a slightly increased probability of the stock price rising is indicated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against claims of stagnant innovation since Steve Jobs.  While Cramer's positive comments offer a slight boost to sentiment, the article also highlights existing concerns about Apple's AI strategy, iPhone sales, and overall market performance.  These counterbalancing factors prevent a strong bullish or bearish prediction. The previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities ranging from 0.35 to 0.6 for a price rise and 0.4 to 0.65 for a price fall. This diversity further supports the conclusion that the news itself doesn't provide a decisive directional signal. Considering the mixed sentiment and lack of substantial new information impacting Apple's fundamentals, the probabilities lean towards a neutral stance with only a slight edge towards a price rise given Cramer's generally positive comments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he defends the company against claims of no innovation since Steve Jobs' era. While this could provide a slight positive sentiment, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's performance in the AI sector and iPhone sales momentum, with shares down 4.3% year-to-date in 2025. The mixed signals from the news, combined with the lack of significant financial data or groundbreaking announcements, suggest a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price. Considering the broader market dynamics and previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, but given their historical ability to innovate and adapt, the impact might be mitigated. Other predictions show varied sentiments but tend to suggest minor impacts. Considering the mixed signals and the overall market dynamics, there is a moderate expectation that the stock price could see slight volatility.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
