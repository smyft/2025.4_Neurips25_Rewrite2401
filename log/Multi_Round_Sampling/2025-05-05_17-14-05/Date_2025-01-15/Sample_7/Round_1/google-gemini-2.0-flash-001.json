(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. While Apple has been previously negatively impacted by these factors, there is also mention of broader opportunities in financials and other sectors that might offer growth. Given that Apple is part of the Mag 7, which has underperformed recently and is facing pressures from macroeconomic factors, this suggests a higher probability of stock price decline in the short term. However, overall market dynamics could still lead to some relative resilience. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is assessed to be higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple does carry debt, it's at a manageable level and is used sparingly and effectively. Key points supporting this include: low net debt to EBITDA ratio, extremely high interest coverage, robust free cash flow generation relative to EBIT, and a decrease from 1 year before. The article concludes that Apple uses debt quite reasonably and that sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. While a small increase in EBIT doesn't scream rapid improvements. This combined with the general view, it is more likely to be positive than negative. However, potential warning signs are also mentioned meaning investors should still be wary. This is not considered likely to trigger a large positive or negative impact alone.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and its innovation, contrasting it with other companies and broader market trends.  Cramer's statement that claims about a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs are 'inflammatory' is a mild positive sentiment towards Apple. However, the article's overall tone is neutral to slightly negative regarding Apple's prospects in the AI sector compared to other companies. The article highlights the general uncertainty around Apple's AI strategy and future performance, suggesting competitiveness concerns relative to other player rather than focusing on specific financial figures or announcements.  Considering the lack of strong positive or negative news impacting Apple directly, the probability of a price change in either direction based on this news alone is relatively low.  The broader market commentary discussed in the piece is largely unrelated to Apple's specific performance and therefore has little effect on probability calculations for Apple stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on his reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's statement about Apple's lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer defends Apple's innovation and integration, the broader context includes mixed performance in the AI era and concerns about iPhone sales momentum. The article does not provide significant new financial data or groundbreaking news that would strongly influence Apple's stock price. However, the defense of Apple's innovation by a prominent figure like Cramer could provide slight positive sentiment. Given the lack of substantial catalysts in the news, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a neutral or minor positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and his response to criticism about the company's innovation since Steve Jobs' era. Cramer seems to defend Apple, suggesting that the criticism is unfounded and expressing his familiarity and integration with Apple products. This positive stance from a notable financial commentator could boost investor confidence. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's performance and its position among the stocks discussed by Cramer, but it does not provide direct negative commentary on the company's prospects. However, it also mentions that Cramer's discussion does not directly imply a significant positive impact on the stock price. Given Cramer's influence and the neutral to slightly positive tone regarding Apple, there's a moderate chance the stock price could rise. However, the overall market performance, economic factors, and competition in the tech industry also play crucial roles in determining Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other stocks. Cramer finds the statement that there's been no innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs' death 'inflammatory'. This suggests a somewhat positive sentiment towards Apple. However, the article also mentions that Apple's shares are down 4.3% year-to-date in 2025, and there are concerns about the company's ability to push AI to consumers and sustain iPhone sales momentum. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but overall, the impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates Goldman Sachs may exit its partnership with Apple related to the Apple Card, which has been associated with significant financial losses and regulatory challenges for Goldman. While Apple may face disruptions in their Apple Card and Savings products, their track record for user-first innovation suggests they can navigate any potential issues smoothly. Goldman's overall business performance remains strong but faces operational shifts away from its Platform Solutions. This news might cause short-term investor uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
