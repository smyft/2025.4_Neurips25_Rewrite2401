This type of headline often indicates potential downward pressure on the stock price due to various factors that could be affecting the company, such as market trends, product performance, or economic conditions. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to assume that the article discusses potential challenges or weaknesses that Apple might face, which could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and subsequently a fall in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising based on this news alone.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}"
