(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is managing its debt levels conservatively while showing strong cash flow and profitability. The company's low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and the fact that it generates robust free cash flow further signal financial stability. Given these factors, the overall sentiment towards the company's debt management is positive, suggesting that the likelihood of the stock price rising is higher. However, potential warning signs noted might introduce some caution among investors. Despite this, the positive financial indicators outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of price increase compared to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' is explicitly negative. Without knowing the specific reasons detailed in the article's content (which is missing), it's impossible to make a definitive prediction. However, the language suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decrease than increase. I'm assuming the article contains arguments supporting this claim.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's prudent use of debt, highlighting its low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage.  The analysis concludes that Apple's debt levels are manageable and pose minimal risk. This positive assessment of Apple's financial health is unlikely to cause a significant stock price drop. While the positive news might cause a slight price increase, the impact is likely to be relatively small compared to other market factors influencing Apple's stock price.  The article also notes that Apple has '2 warning signs' which are not detailed, this represents a potential downside that is not explicitly addressed by the article.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderate, but the probability of a price fall is very low because the core message is positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs and broader market commentary. While Cramer's remarks may provide some positive sentiment, the article does not contain any significant new financial data, product announcements, or earnings updates that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The market's reaction to such commentary is typically muted unless it triggers broader investor sentiment shifts. Given the lack of concrete catalysts in the news, the probabilities of a significant price movement in either direction are low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance in the current year. The use of the word 'hammered' implies a significant potential decline in stock price. This kind of headline typically influences investor sentiment negatively, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price as investors may sell their holdings in anticipation of poor performance. Therefore, based on this headline, the probability of the stock price falling appears higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This type of headline often indicates potential downward pressure on the stock price due to various factors that could be affecting the company, such as market trends, product performance, or economic conditions. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to assume that the article discusses potential challenges or weaknesses that Apple might face, which could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and subsequently a fall in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising based on this news alone.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt. Apple has shown a minimal net debt load, strong cash reserves, and robust EBIT margins, which indicate a company in a strong financial position. These factors suggest that the company can comfortably manage its debt burden, leading to reduced financial risks and improved investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's conservative use of debt and strong financial metrics, including a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and substantial interest coverage. The company's ability to generate robust free cash flow further supports the positive outlook on its financial health. Despite noting two warning signs, the overall sentiment regarding Apple's debt management is favorable. This promotes investor confidence, likely leading to an increased probability of stock price rise. However, the previous mixed predictions from others, especially those suggesting a more cautious outlook, introduce some uncertainty. Therefore, my estimation considers both the positive indicators and potential investor caution.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline is strongly negative: \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year.\" This implies a high likelihood of negative news within the article, which would typically lead to a drop in stock price. However, the previous predictions by other models are diverse. Some models heavily weight the negative headline (giving high probabilities to stock price falling) while others focused on potential positive information within the *contents* of articles they claimed to analyze, assigning higher probabilities to price increases. Given that the article content is unavailable to me outside of its title, and considering the strongly negative wording of the headline, I'm giving a higher probability to a stock price fall, but slightly less extreme given the contradictory opinions in round 0.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, highlighting its low net debt, strong cash reserves, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow.  This positive financial picture suggests a low risk of financial distress and should, in theory, be viewed favorably by investors.  While the article mentions two unspecified warning signs, the overwhelming emphasis is on the positive aspects of Apple's financial health.  Many previous models provided varied probabilities, some based on additional negative news not included in this article.  Considering the exclusively positive financial information provided, the probability of a price rise is higher than the probability of a price fall. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that stock prices are affected by numerous factors beyond a single news article, including overall market sentiment, broader economic conditions, and any unforeseen events. Therefore, the probabilities are not skewed strongly towards one side, since the article doesn't contain a major event and the positive aspects are not overwhelmingly significant in comparison to the potential unspecified warning signs.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs and broader market commentary. While Cramer's remarks may provide some positive sentiment, the article does not contain any significant new financial data, product announcements, or earnings updates that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The market's reaction to such commentary is typically muted unless it triggers broader investor sentiment shifts. Given the lack of concrete catalysts in the news, the probabilities of a significant price movement in either direction are low. However, considering the mixed performance of Apple's stock in 2025 and the ongoing concerns about innovation and iPhone sales, the sentiment leans slightly negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' has a negative tone, suggesting potential downward pressure on Apple's stock price. However, the previous predictions from various models provide mixed sentiments. Some models focus on Apple's financial health, noting its conservative debt management, strong cash flow, and profitability, which suggest a positive outlook. Others emphasize the negative tone of the headline, assigning a higher probability to a stock price decrease. Considering the mixed financial indicators and the explicitly negative headline, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price has a higher chance of falling than rising. However, the presence of positive financial indicators prevents a unanimous prediction of a significant decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. However, considering the previous predictions and the fact that some models have assigned a higher probability to the stock price rising due to Apple's prudent debt management and strong financial indicators, it's essential to balance the negative sentiment with the company's fundamental strengths. The predictions from other models indicate a wide range of beliefs, from a higher likelihood of the stock price falling to a moderate probability of it rising. Given the explicit negative tone of the headline but also considering the potential for the company's financial health to mitigate negative impacts, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's financial health reveals that the company employs a conservative approach to debt management, showcasing strong financial metrics such as a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and very high interest coverage. This suggests that Apple is in a robust position to handle its debt obligations and generates significant free cash flow, which further mitigates risks related to its liabilities. While the article does mention some warning signs that may create caution among investors, the overall sentiment regarding Apple's financial management is positive. This leads to an implied higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. The recent mixed predictions from other models present a range of outcomes, but the overall financial stability and prudent risk management from Apple suggest a stronger probability of price increase compared to decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline is negative, suggesting a potential decline in Apple's stock price. However, several models in the previous rounds analyzed content seemingly different than what the headline indicates (focusing on debt management and financial health), leading to mixed predictions. While the headline is overtly negative, the varied responses in previous rounds, some emphasizing positive financial indicators, introduce uncertainty. I slightly increase the probability of a price fall given the headline, but temper it due to the diverse opinions of other models and the possibility of mitigating factors within the article content.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, highlighting its strong financial position.  Key positive indicators include a low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation. This suggests a low risk of financial distress and should be viewed favorably by investors. However, the article mentions two unspecified 'warning signs', which introduces uncertainty.  The previous predictions show considerable divergence, some focusing heavily on the potentially negative implications of an unspecified headline (which is not included in this article directly, the headline is only given in the context of multiple previous rounds), others emphasizing Apple's sound financial health. Considering the predominantly positive financial data presented in this particular news piece, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall. However, the unspecified warning signs and the overall market volatility prevent a strong positive prediction.  The range of previous predictions emphasizes that other factors outside this news piece are also influencing market sentiment towards AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs and broader market commentary. While Cramer's remarks may provide some positive sentiment, the article does not contain any significant new financial data, product announcements, or earnings updates that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The market's reaction to such commentary is typically muted unless it triggers broader investor sentiment shifts. Given the lack of concrete catalysts in the news, the probabilities of a significant price movement in either direction are low. However, considering the mixed performance of Apple's stock in 2025 and the ongoing concerns about innovation and iPhone sales, the sentiment leans slightly negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of the news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. However, considering the previous predictions from various models, which provide mixed sentiments regarding Apple's financial health and the impact of the headline, it's essential to balance the negative sentiment with the company's fundamental strengths. Some models focus on Apple's conservative debt management, strong cash flow, and profitability, suggesting a positive outlook, while others emphasize the negative tone of the headline, assigning a higher probability to a stock price decrease. Given the explicit negative tone of the headline but also considering the potential for the company's financial health to mitigate negative impacts, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautious approach, acknowledging both the positive financial indicators and the potential downward pressure indicated by the headline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt, coupled with strong cash reserves and robust free cash flow, which contributes to a favorable financial health outlook. Most recent predictions show a mixed sentiment with a slight bias toward caution. While some predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive financial metrics, others emphasize the negative headline and potential warning signs. Considering the overall positive financial picture and the fact that Apple has manageable debt and strong cash flow, along with the mix of sentiments expressed in the previous rounds, the probability of the stock price rising may be moderately higher. However, the caution indicated by previous predictions suggests a balanced outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's financial condition reveals a conservative approach to debt management, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and significant interest coverage. Apple's ability to generate robust free cash flow further supports its capability to handle its debt obligations confidently. Although the article mentions two unspecified warning signs, the overall sentiment surrounding Apple's financial stability remains positive. Previous predictions reflected a mix of optimism and caution, but the strong fundamentals in the context of its debt management suggest a higher probability of stock price increase. Thus, the expected probability of the stock price rising is greater than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The overarching narrative presents a conflict: a negative headline ('Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year') versus analyses focusing on Apple's sound financial metrics (conservative debt management, high cash flow). Previous rounds show a divergence in predictions, some weighted heavily on the headline, others on financial strength, and some attempting to balance both. In rounds where the article was claimed to focus on financial factors, predictions skewed positive. Where just the sentiment of the headline was considered, predictions were negative. Many models noted 'warning signs' that tempered their predictions, along with the state of 2025 performance and innovation concerns. Given the ambiguity (positive financials vs. negative headline and vague concerns) and the variability of interpretations in previous rounds, I'll adjust slightly toward the negative headline's influence but not overwhelmingly. The headline is a powerful signal, but the persistent evidence of strong financials is also relevant. I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling but still acknowledge the underlying strength.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, highlighting its strong financial position with a low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow. This positive financial picture suggests a low risk of financial distress and should be viewed favorably by investors.  However, the article mentions two unspecified 'warning signs', which introduces a degree of uncertainty.  The previous predictions from various models show significant divergence, reflecting the influence of factors beyond this specific news item, including market sentiment and other information not available in this context.  The headline used in previous rounds ('Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year') is strongly negative, and while not directly included here, its consistent appearance in previous prediction rounds suggests the possibility of prevailing bearish sentiment influencing the overall outlook. Considering the predominantly positive financial data presented in this news piece, I've assigned a higher probability to a price rise than a price fall. However, the unspecified warning signs, the negative headline mentioned in previous rounds, and the overall market volatility prevent a strong positive prediction.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the balance between the positive financial news and the lingering uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs and broader market commentary.

However, considering the mixed performance of Apple's stock in 2025 and the ongoing concerns about innovation and iPhone sales, the sentiment leans slightly negative. Previous predictions from other models also show a mixed sentiment, with some focusing on Apple's strong financial health and others emphasizing the negative tone of the headline. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. However, analyzing the previous predictions and the general sentiment around Apple's financial health, it appears that the company's conservative debt management, strong cash flow, and profitability contribute to a mixed outlook. While the headline indicates potential risks, Apple's financial indicators, such as its low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage, suggest a positive assessment of its financial stability. Considering these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, but the negative tone of the headline cannot be ignored.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions suggests a mixed sentiment towards Apple's stock performance. The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' implies a negative outlook, but the content of the news article, as analyzed by some models, highlights Apple's conservative debt management, strong cash flow, and profitability. Considering the diverse opinions and the company's fundamental strengths, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautious approach. The overall positive financial picture and manageable debt suggest a moderate probability of the stock price rising, while the negative headline and potential warning signs indicate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt, coupled with strong cash reserves and robust free cash flow, which contributes to a favorable financial health outlook.
