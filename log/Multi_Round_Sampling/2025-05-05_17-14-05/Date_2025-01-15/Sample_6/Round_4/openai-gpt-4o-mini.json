(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. While Apple has been previously negatively impacted by these factors, there is also mention of broader opportunities in financials and other sectors that might offer growth. Given that Apple is part of the Mag 7, which has underperformed recently and is facing pressures from macroeconomic factors, this suggests a higher probability of stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway (indicating Buffett's confidence), and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic. Despite the mixed signals, the overall tone is slightly positive due to Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives. This translates into a higher likelihood of a price rise in the short term than a price drop. The \"Double Down\" ad is generic and doesn't specifically recommend the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the Apple Card's struggles are a negative for Goldman, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted. The article highlights that Apple is adept at navigating such situations, and a smooth transition to a new partner is possible, minimizing disruption to users and the Apple ecosystem.  The potential for some short-term negative market reaction due to uncertainty is present, but Apple's overall strong financial position and broader product ecosystem are likely to outweigh the specific impact of the Apple Card partnership change. The focus on Goldman's financial issues and Apple's capacity for innovation suggests that any negative impact on Apple's stock will be temporary and relatively small compared to the overall market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, implying potential challenges or risks that could lead to a decline in its stock price. While the content of the news is not provided, the headline alone indicates bearish sentiment. However, without specific details on the reasons (e.g., financial performance, market conditions, or external factors), the analysis is limited to the sentiment conveyed by the headline. Given this, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but the exact probabilities are uncertain due to the lack of detailed information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment choices, highlighting Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top picks. Despite recent stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, the article suggests that Apple is on the cusp of significant growth, particularly with its advancements in AI technology and processor chip development for AI data centers. The article also mentions that Berkshire Hathaway still holds a significant stake in Apple, which could indicate confidence in the company's future prospects. However, the recent sale of 600 million shares by Berkshire may indicate a lack of confidence or a strategic move to manage their portfolio. Overall, the article presents a positive outlook on Apple's potential for growth, which could influence investor sentiment positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty and could negatively impact Apple's financial products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to pivot smoothly may mitigate the risks. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could affect user experience, but Apple's strong brand loyalty and ecosystem may limit the long-term damage. Considering these factors, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with an analyst criticizing the perceived lack of innovation post-Steve Jobs. However, the overall market context and the company's strong position in the technology sector suggest a balanced outlook. The stock has shown positive performance trends post-WWDC, and despite current headwinds, it remains a high-profile, influential company with substantial investor interest.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news suggests a growing concern over the stagnation of high-growth stocks, including Apple's membership in the Magnificent Seven, amid rising bond yields and expectations of slower earnings growth in the tech sector. Analysts argue that investors should consider other stocks in the S&P 500 that may provide better growth opportunities. Apple's recent underperformance and the broader market skepticism, particularly regarding tech stocks, imply a higher probability of a stock price decline in the near term. However, some analysts still view Apple as a strong investment due to its past resilience and ongoing innovations. Therefore, I estimate a higher likelihood of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. It highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, indicating strong fundamentals and long-term investment potential. Buffett's significant stake suggests confidence in the company. However, it also mentions stagnant revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's holdings, albeit possibly for strategic reasons. The focus on Apple's new AI initiatives is a positive catalyst for future growth. Considering both positive and negative elements, along with previous predictions, particularly the recent increase in bullish sentiment from some models, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. This considers the inherent uncertainty in stock predictions and the mixed signals in the news article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership presents a relatively low-impact event for Apple's stock price. While it introduces some uncertainty regarding the Apple Card's future and could cause minor short-term volatility, several factors mitigate the risk of a significant price drop. Apple has demonstrated a strong ability to adapt and innovate.  A switch in partners is unlikely to severely damage the Apple ecosystem or drastically change user experience, given Apple's control over its platform.  Furthermore, the news focuses on Goldman Sachs' financial struggles, rather than any inherent weakness in the Apple Card itself.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly toward a price decrease.  However, the magnitude of the predicted decreases is generally modest. Considering these factors and the overall strong performance of Apple, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the difference is small.  The news is unlikely to be a major catalyst for significant stock movement in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating potential challenges or risks that could lead to a decline in its stock price. Previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling (0.7) due to macroeconomic pressures and slowing earnings growth, while others suggest a more balanced or slightly positive outlook (0.5-0.6) based on Apple's strong financial position and potential growth in AI. Considering the bearish headline and the mixed but generally cautious sentiment from previous analyses, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising. However, Apple's robust ecosystem and historical resilience mitigate some of the downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of Warren Buffett's top picks, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic. Despite the mixed signals, the overall tone is slightly positive due to Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives. This translates into a higher likelihood of a price rise in the short term than a price drop.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership presents a mixed impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the Apple Card's struggles are a negative for Goldman, the effect on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted due to Apple's strong financial position, ability to innovate, and potential for a smooth transition to a new partner. Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of views from slightly bearish to slightly bullish. However, given Apple's history of navigating such situations and its strong ecosystem, the probability of a significant negative impact on the stock price is moderate. Thus, the estimated probabilities reflect a slight edge towards a neutral or mildly positive outcome, considering the company's overall strength and resilience.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting Apple Inc., including market sentiment, recent stock performance, and statements about innovation. The overall sentiment seems mixed with some positive elements such as Apple's strong ecosystem, investor interest, and potential AI-driven growth. However, there is also criticism regarding innovation post-Steve Jobs, which could impact investor confidence. The diverse range of opinions from different analysts adds complexity, but the majority still hold a generally confident stance on Apple's long-term prospects.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns regarding the performance of Apple's stock, particularly as part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' amidst rising bond yields and expectations of slower earnings growth. While some analysts recognize the potential for investment in other sectors and the possibility of AI-driven growth for Apple, the prevailing sentiment appears cautious. Apple's recent underperformance and the shifting focus towards other S&P 500 stocks may indicate a higher likelihood of a stock price decline in the short term. Overall, the analysis suggests leaning towards a probability of falling stock prices greater than that of rising, reflecting investor sentiment affected by macroeconomic factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple. It acknowledges the stagnant revenue and reduced Berkshire stake (potentially strategic). However, it emphasizes Buffett's continued large holding, Apple's AI initiatives, and its 'timeless' nature. The mixed opinions from previous rounds also highlight the ambiguity, with a slight leaning towards bullish sentiment in the most recent predictions from some models. I will weigh a bit on the slightly positive long term view even though the sales data is flat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership is largely negative for Goldman Sachs, but its impact on Apple is likely to be minimal to moderately negative in the short-term, and potentially slightly positive in the long-term.  While a disruption to Apple Card services is possible during a transition to a new partner, Apple's strong brand and ecosystem suggest a smooth transition is likely.  The fact that Goldman Sachs is exiting due to financial losses and regulatory issues, rather than Apple's performance, diminishes the negative impact.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight tendency towards a price decrease, but the magnitude is generally small.  The overall strong financial health of Apple and the potential for a positive long-term outcome for Apple by switching partners (potentially finding a more synergistic partner) outweighs the short-term uncertainty. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the difference is modest, suggesting a mostly neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). The headline suggests a potential negative impact on the stock, citing concerns over slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. However, previous predictions from various models show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling (0.6-0.7) due to macroeconomic pressures, while others suggest a more balanced or slightly positive outlook (0.5-0.55) based on Apple's strong financial position and potential growth in AI. The bearish headline and the mixed but generally cautious sentiment from previous analyses suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, Apple's robust ecosystem and historical resilience mitigate some of the downside risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of Warren Buffett's top picks, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic.

However, there is also criticism regarding innovation post-Steve Jobs, which could impact investor confidence. The diverse range of opinions from different analysts adds complexity, but the majority still hold a generally confident stance on Apple's long-term prospects. Additionally, the mentions of Warren Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives support a slightly positive outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards a broader range of S&P 500 stocks, which may indicate a bearish tilt for Apple given its recent underperformance amidst rising bond yields and expectations of slower earnings growth in the tech sector. Despite some analysts recognizing Apple's potential for AI-driven growth and its strong fundamentals, the prevailing sentiment is cautious due to macroeconomic pressures. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest that while some analysts see potential for growth, the overall outlook leans more towards a decline, supporting the estimated probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article is framed around Warren Buffett's stock picks, which generally lends a positive connotation. However, it also mentions some headwinds for Apple, such as stagnant revenue, iPhone performance, and the paring down of Berkshire's stake. This could be seen as concerning, but is offset by the article's assertion that the reduction could be strategic due to possible tax implications, and also by the significant ongoing holding. Critically the company is making strategic moves into AI which is likely to be viewed as positive The historical analysis presents a mixed view, with some models slightly favouring a price rise due to Buffett's continued investment and Apple's AI initiatives. Others are more negative due to broader market trends and concerns about revenue stagnation. Given the ambiguity in the article and the previous predictions, leaning slightly on the positive side due to Buffetts AI move, a nearly neutral stance seems fair, but slightly more toward a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership is primarily negative for Goldman Sachs, not Apple. While there's short-term uncertainty regarding a potential disruption to Apple Card services during a partner transition, Apple's robust ecosystem and brand loyalty should mitigate any significant negative impact.  The article highlights Apple's history of innovation and smooth pivots.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, oscillating around a relatively neutral outlook.  While some models lean slightly bearish due to broader macroeconomic concerns and the relatively negative sentiment on the 'Magnificent Seven', others show some bullishness due to Apple\u2019s strong fundamentals, continued large holding by Warren Buffett, and potential growth in the AI sector.  Considering the limited direct impact on Apple and the overall positive long-term outlook, a slightly positive probability of a price rise is warranted although the movement is unlikely to be significant. The consensus leans toward minimal stock price movement, suggesting a relatively neutral impact on AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating potential challenges or risks that could lead to a decline in its stock price.
