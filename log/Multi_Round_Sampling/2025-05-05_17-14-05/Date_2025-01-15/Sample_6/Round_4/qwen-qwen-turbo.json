(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. While Apple has been previously negatively impacted by these factors, there is also mention of broader opportunities in financials and other sectors that might offer growth. Given that Apple is part of the Mag 7, which has underperformed recently and is facing pressures from macroeconomic factors, this suggests a higher probability of stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway (indicating Buffett's confidence), and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic. Despite the mixed signals, the overall tone is slightly positive due to Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives. This translates into a higher likelihood of a price rise in the short term than a price drop. The \"Double Down\" ad is generic and doesn't specifically recommend the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the Apple Card's struggles are a negative for Goldman, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted. The article highlights that Apple is adept at navigating such situations, and a smooth transition to a new partner is possible, minimizing disruption to users and the Apple ecosystem.  The potential for some short-term negative market reaction due to uncertainty is present, but Apple's overall strong financial position and broader product ecosystem are likely to outweigh the specific impact of the Apple Card partnership change. The focus on Goldman's financial issues and Apple's capacity for innovation suggests that any negative impact on Apple's stock will be temporary and relatively small compared to the overall market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, implying potential challenges or risks that could lead to a decline in its stock price. While the content of the news is not provided, the headline alone indicates bearish sentiment. However, without specific details on the reasons (e.g., financial performance, market conditions, or external factors), the analysis is limited to the sentiment conveyed by the headline. Given this, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but the exact probabilities are uncertain due to the lack of detailed information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment choices, highlighting Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top picks. Despite recent stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, the article suggests that Apple is on the cusp of significant growth, particularly with its advancements in AI technology and processor chip development for AI data centers. The article also mentions that Berkshire Hathaway still holds a significant stake in Apple, which could indicate confidence in the company's future prospects. However, the recent sale of 600 million shares by Berkshire may indicate a lack of confidence or a strategic move to manage their portfolio. Overall, the article presents a positive outlook on Apple's potential for growth, which could influence investor sentiment positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty and could negatively impact Apple's financial products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to pivot smoothly may mitigate the risks. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could affect user experience, but Apple's strong brand loyalty and ecosystem may limit the long-term damage. Considering these factors, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with an analyst criticizing the perceived lack of innovation post-Steve Jobs. However, the overall market context and the company's strong position in the technology sector suggest a balanced outlook. The stock has shown positive performance trends post-WWDC, and despite current headwinds, it remains a high-profile, influential company with substantial investor interest.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news suggests a growing concern over the stagnation of high-growth stocks, including Apple's membership in the Magnificent Seven, amid rising bond yields and expectations of slower earnings growth in the tech sector. Analysts argue that investors should consider other stocks in the S&P 500 that may provide better growth opportunities. Apple's recent underperformance and the broader market skepticism, particularly regarding tech stocks, imply a higher probability of a stock price decline in the near term. However, some analysts still view Apple as a strong investment due to its past resilience and ongoing innovations. Therefore, I estimate a higher likelihood of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. It highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, indicating strong fundamentals and long-term investment potential. Buffett's significant stake suggests confidence in the company. However, it also mentions stagnant revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's holdings, albeit possibly for strategic reasons. The focus on Apple's new AI initiatives is a positive catalyst for future growth. Considering both positive and negative elements, along with previous predictions, particularly the recent increase in bullish sentiment from some models, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. This considers the inherent uncertainty in stock predictions and the mixed signals in the news article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership presents a relatively low-impact event for Apple's stock price. While it introduces some uncertainty regarding the Apple Card's future and could cause minor short-term volatility, several factors mitigate the risk of a significant price drop. Apple has demonstrated a strong ability to adapt and innovate.  A switch in partners is unlikely to severely damage the Apple ecosystem or drastically change user experience, given Apple's control over its platform.  Furthermore, the news focuses on Goldman Sachs' financial struggles, rather than any inherent weakness in the Apple Card itself.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly toward a price decrease.  However, the magnitude of the predicted decreases is generally modest. Considering these factors and the overall strong performance of Apple, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the difference is small.  The news is unlikely to be a major catalyst for significant stock movement in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating potential challenges or risks that could lead to a decline in its stock price. Previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling (0.7) due to macroeconomic pressures and slowing earnings growth, while others suggest a more balanced or slightly positive outlook (0.5-0.6) based on Apple's strong financial position and potential growth in AI. Considering the bearish headline and the mixed but generally cautious sentiment from previous analyses, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising. However, Apple's robust ecosystem and historical resilience mitigate some of the downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of Warren Buffett's top picks, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic. Despite the mixed signals, the overall tone is slightly positive due to Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives. This translates into a higher likelihood of a price rise in the short term than a price drop.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership presents a mixed impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the Apple Card's struggles are a negative for Goldman, the effect on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted due to Apple's strong financial position, ability to innovate, and potential for a smooth transition to a new partner. Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of views from slightly bearish to slightly bullish. However, given Apple's history of navigating such situations and its strong ecosystem, the probability of a significant negative impact on the stock price is moderate. Thus, the estimated probabilities reflect a slight edge towards a neutral or mildly positive outcome, considering the company's overall strength and resilience.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting Apple Inc., including market sentiment, recent stock performance, and statements about innovation. The overall sentiment seems mixed with some positive elements such as Apple's strong ecosystem, investor interest, and potential AI-driven growth. However, there is also criticism regarding innovation post-Steve Jobs, which could impact investor confidence. The diverse range of opinions from different analysts adds complexity, but the majority still hold a generally confident stance on Apple's long-term prospects.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns regarding the performance of Apple's stock, particularly as part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' amidst rising bond yields and expectations of slower earnings growth. While some analysts recognize the potential for investment in other sectors and the possibility of AI-driven growth for Apple, the prevailing sentiment appears cautious. Apple's recent underperformance and the shifting focus towards other S&P 500 stocks may indicate a higher likelihood of a stock price decline in the short term. Overall, the analysis suggests leaning towards a probability of falling stock prices greater than that of rising, reflecting investor sentiment affected by macroeconomic factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple. It acknowledges the stagnant revenue and reduced Berkshire stake (potentially strategic). However, it emphasizes Buffett's continued large holding, Apple's AI initiatives, and its 'timeless' nature. The mixed opinions from previous rounds also highlight the ambiguity, with a slight leaning towards bullish sentiment in the most recent predictions from some models. I will weigh a bit on the slightly positive long term view even though the sales data is flat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership is largely negative for Goldman Sachs, but its impact on Apple is likely to be minimal to moderately negative in the short-term, and potentially slightly positive in the long-term.  While a disruption to Apple Card services is possible during a transition to a new partner, Apple's strong brand and ecosystem suggest a smooth transition is likely.  The fact that Goldman Sachs is exiting due to financial losses and regulatory issues, rather than Apple's performance, diminishes the negative impact.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight tendency towards a price decrease, but the magnitude is generally small.  The overall strong financial health of Apple and the potential for a positive long-term outcome for Apple by switching partners (potentially finding a more synergistic partner) outweighs the short-term uncertainty. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the difference is modest, suggesting a mostly neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). The headline suggests a potential negative impact on the stock, citing concerns over slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. However, previous predictions from various models show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling (0.6-0.7) due to macroeconomic pressures, while others suggest a more balanced or slightly positive outlook (0.5-0.55) based on Apple's strong financial position and potential growth in AI. The bearish headline and the mixed but generally cautious sentiment from previous analyses suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, Apple's robust ecosystem and historical resilience mitigate some of the downside risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of Warren Buffett's top picks, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic. Despite the mixed signals, the overall tone is slightly positive due to Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives.

However, there is also criticism regarding innovation post-Steve Jobs, which could impact investor confidence. The diverse range of opinions from different analysts adds complexity, but the majority still hold a generally confident stance on Apple's long-term prospects. Additionally, the mentions of Warren Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives support a slightly positive outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards a broader range of S&P 500 stocks, which may indicate a bearish tilt for Apple given its recent underperformance amidst rising bond yields and expectations of slower earnings growth in the tech sector. Despite some analysts recognizing Apple's potential for AI-driven growth and its strong fundamentals, the prevailing sentiment is cautious due to macroeconomic pressures. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest that while some analysts see potential for growth, the overall outlook leans more towards a decline, supporting the estimated probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article is framed around Warren Buffett's stock picks, which generally lends a positive connotation. However, it also mentions some headwinds for Apple, such as stagnant revenue, iPhone performance, and the paring down of Berkshire's stake. This could be seen as concerning, but is offset by the article's assertion that the reduction could be strategic due to possible tax implications, and also by the significant ongoing holding. Critically the company is making strategic moves into AI which is likely to be viewed as positive The historical analysis presents a mixed view, with some models slightly favouring a price rise due to Buffett's continued investment and Apple's AI initiatives. Others are more negative due to broader market trends and concerns about revenue stagnation. Given the ambiguity in the article and the previous predictions, leaning slightly on the positive side due to Buffetts AI move, a nearly neutral stance seems fair, but slightly more toward a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership is primarily negative for Goldman Sachs, not Apple. While there's short-term uncertainty regarding a potential disruption to Apple Card services during a partner transition, Apple's robust ecosystem and brand loyalty should mitigate any significant negative impact.  The article highlights Apple's history of innovation and smooth pivots.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, oscillating around a relatively neutral outlook.  While some models lean slightly bearish due to broader macroeconomic concerns and the relatively negative sentiment on the 'Magnificent Seven', others show some bullishness due to Apple\u2019s strong fundamentals, continued large holding by Warren Buffett, and potential growth in the AI sector.  Considering the limited direct impact on Apple and the overall positive long-term outlook, a slightly positive probability of a price rise is warranted although the movement is unlikely to be significant. The consensus leans toward minimal stock price movement, suggesting a relatively neutral impact on AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating potential challenges or risks that could lead to a decline in its stock price. Previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling (0.6-0.7) due to macroeconomic pressures and slowing earnings growth, while others suggest a more balanced or slightly positive outlook (0.5-0.55) based on Apple's strong financial position and potential growth in AI. The bearish headline and the mixed but generally cautious sentiment from previous analyses suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, Apple's robust ecosystem and historical resilience mitigate some of the downside risks.
