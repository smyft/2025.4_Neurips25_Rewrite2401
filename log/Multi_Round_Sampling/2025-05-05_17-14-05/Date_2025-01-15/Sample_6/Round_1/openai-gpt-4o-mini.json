(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. While Apple has been previously negatively impacted by these factors, there is also mention of broader opportunities in financials and other sectors that might offer growth. Given that Apple is part of the Mag 7, which has underperformed recently and is facing pressures from macroeconomic factors, this suggests a higher probability of stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positively, it emphasizes Apple's timeless nature, significant stake held by Berkshire Hathaway (indicating Buffett's confidence), and potential growth in the AI sector. Negatively, it mentions stagnant revenue and a recent paring down of Berkshire's stake in Apple, though it suggests that might be strategic. Despite the mixed signals, the overall tone is slightly positive due to Buffett's continued large holding and Apple's AI initiatives. This translates into a higher likelihood of a price rise in the short term than a price drop. The \"Double Down\" ad is generic and doesn't specifically recommend the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the Apple Card's struggles are a negative for Goldman, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted. The article highlights that Apple is adept at navigating such situations, and a smooth transition to a new partner is possible, minimizing disruption to users and the Apple ecosystem.  The potential for some short-term negative market reaction due to uncertainty is present, but Apple's overall strong financial position and broader product ecosystem are likely to outweigh the specific impact of the Apple Card partnership change. The focus on Goldman's financial issues and Apple's capacity for innovation suggests that any negative impact on Apple's stock will be temporary and relatively small compared to the overall market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, implying potential challenges or risks that could lead to a decline in its stock price. While the content of the news is not provided, the headline alone indicates bearish sentiment. However, without specific details on the reasons (e.g., financial performance, market conditions, or external factors), the analysis is limited to the sentiment conveyed by the headline. Given this, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but the exact probabilities are uncertain due to the lack of detailed information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment choices, highlighting Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top picks. Despite recent stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, the article suggests that Apple is on the cusp of significant growth, particularly with its advancements in AI technology and processor chip development for AI data centers. The article also mentions that Berkshire Hathaway still holds a significant stake in Apple, which could indicate confidence in the company's future prospects. However, the recent sale of 600 million shares by Berkshire may indicate a lack of confidence or a strategic move to manage their portfolio. Overall, the article presents a positive outlook on Apple's potential for growth, which could influence investor sentiment positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership may cause short-term uncertainty and could negatively impact Apple's financial products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to pivot smoothly may mitigate the risks. The potential disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could affect user experience, but Apple's strong brand loyalty and ecosystem may limit the long-term damage. Considering these factors, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with an analyst criticizing the perceived lack of innovation post-Steve Jobs. However, the overall market context and the company's strong position in the technology sector suggest a balanced outlook. The stock has shown positive performance trends post-WWDC, and despite current headwinds, it remains a high-profile, influential company with substantial investor interest.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
