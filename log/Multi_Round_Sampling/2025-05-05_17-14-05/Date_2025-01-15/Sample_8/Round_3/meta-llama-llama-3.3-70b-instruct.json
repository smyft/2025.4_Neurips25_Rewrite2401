(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is managing its debt levels conservatively while showing strong cash flow and profitability. The company's low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and the fact that it generates robust free cash flow further signal financial stability. Given these factors, the overall sentiment towards the company's debt management is positive, suggesting that the likelihood of the stock price rising is higher. However, potential warning signs noted might introduce some caution among investors. Despite this, the positive financial indicators outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of price increase compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' strongly suggests negative sentiment. Without access to the actual news content detailing the reasons 'why,' I must assume a generally pessimistic outlook. The use of the word 'hammered' indicates a potentially significant price decrease. While Apple is a strong company, negative news can still impact its stock price in the short term. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative use of debt, highlighting its strong financial position with low net debt, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow.  These are positive indicators of financial health and stability. While the article mentions two unspecified warning signs, the overall tone is highly positive regarding Apple's financial management.  Given the overwhelmingly positive financial picture painted in the article, a stock price rise is more likely than a fall in the short term. However, it's important to remember that this is just one factor influencing stock price, and other market forces could outweigh this positive news. The probabilities are therefore assigned based on this analysis, acknowledging the limitations of basing predictions solely on a single news article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. While this could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem in the short term, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and user experience suggests it may smoothly transition to a new partner. The potential disruption could cause some investor concern, but Apple's overall financial health and diversified revenue streams likely mitigate significant negative impact. Conversely, Goldman Sachs' core businesses are performing well, and exiting a loss-making venture could be viewed positively by investors. However, the news is more directly relevant to Apple's ecosystem.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically in response to claims that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer finds this claim 'inflammatory' and highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. While the article does not provide specific positive or negative financial data about Apple, Cramer's defense of the company's innovation suggests a neutral to positive outlook. However, the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not introduce new financial information or significant market-moving data. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards a positive view due to Cramer's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Cramer defends Apple against claims that the company has not innovated since Steve Jobs' death, finding such statements 'inflammatory.' However, the overall tone of the article does not significantly lean towards a positive or negative outlook on AAPL specifically due to this comment. The article mentions that AAPL ranks 3rd on the list of stocks Jim Cramer discussed and notes the potential of AAPL as an investment but suggests other AI stocks might hold greater promise. Given this context, the news is somewhat neutral but slightly positive for AAPL, as it defends the company against negative innovation claims without providing significant negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, strong cash flow, and high interest coverage, which generally indicate solid financial health and stability. Despite two warning signs mentioned, the positive indicators of low net debt relative to earnings and robust free cash flow suggest that Apple is well-positioned to manage its obligations. These factors lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising. Conversely, previous predictions from others indicate some divided sentiment, but overall, the strong fundamentals discussed in the news provide a more bullish outlook. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to the stock price rising while acknowledging some risk factors that may lead to a lower probability of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" strongly suggests a negative outlook. While Apple is a strong company, such a stark warning usually precedes information likely to drive the stock price down. The previous rounds reflect differing opinions, with some models focusing on Apple's strong fundamentals while others prioritize the negative implications of the initial headline and other negative news such as Goldman Sachs' concerns about Apple Card partnership. Given all these clues, I am factoring in the strong negative signal of the headline and assign a consequently heightened probability for a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, presenting a positive outlook on its financial health.  Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow suggest strong financial stability. While the article mentions unspecified warning signs, the overwhelmingly positive portrayal of Apple's financial management overshadows these cautions.  However, the previous predictions show a divergence of opinions, ranging from strongly positive to strongly negative.  Some models highlight potential negative impacts from broader market shifts or unrelated news. While the article itself is bullish on Apple's debt management, it's crucial to acknowledge that stock prices are influenced by numerous factors beyond a single news item. To incorporate this uncertainty, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a more moderate estimate compared to a purely article-based assessment, acknowledging the potential for external factors and market sentiment to influence the price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. While this could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem in the short term, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and user experience suggests it may smoothly transition to a new partner. The potential disruption could cause some investor concern, but Apple's overall financial health and diversified revenue streams likely mitigate significant negative impact. Conversely, Goldman Sachs' core businesses are performing well, and exiting a loss-making venture could be viewed positively by investors. However, the news is more directly relevant to Apple's ecosystem. Given the mixed implications and Apple's resilience, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a negative short-term impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically his defense against claims that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer finds such claims 'inflammatory' and highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. While the article does not provide specific positive or negative financial data about Apple, Cramer's defense suggests a neutral to positive outlook. However, the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not introduce new financial information or significant market-moving data. The mixed predictions from previous models also suggest a balanced view, with slight biases towards a positive outlook due to Cramer's comments and the company's strong financial health.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he defends the company against claims that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer's comments are seen as positive for the company, but the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not introduce new financial information or significant market-moving data. Considering the mixed views from previous predictions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price rise and others to a fall, the overall sentiment seems balanced. However, given Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation and the lack of significant negative news, a slightly positive outlook can be inferred. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated with a slight bias towards a positive view.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks. Previous predictions show varied opinions, but most predictions point towards a bearish outlook. The recent underperformance of Apple relative to other major tech stocks aligns with this broader shift.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's financial position reveals strong fundamentals, including a conservative use of debt, a low net debt to EBITDA ratio, and significant interest coverage, suggesting financial stability. Despite two warning signs noted in the analysis, the overall sentiment leans positively due to Apple's ability to generate robust free cash flow, which indicates that it can comfortably manage its obligations. Previous predictions vary, but the predominant view is that the positive indicators from the recent news outweigh the potential risks. Therefore, the estimated probability of a stock price rise is higher than that of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' initially suggests a negative outlook. However, analyzing the previous rounds, the interpretations vary significantly. Some models focused on Apple's strong fundamentals, like conservative debt management and strong cash flow, suggesting a price increase. Others emphasized negative factors, such as a potential shift away from Magnificent Seven stocks, the potential loss of the Apple Card partnership with Goldman Sachs, or simply the negative connotation of the headline. The most consistent bearish argument is the headline itself and the 'Magnificent Seven' shift, while the bullish arguments center around Apple's inherent financial strengths. Given that the headline is a strong negative signal that could influence investor sentiment even if the underlying cause is temporary or not drastically impactful, and weighting the opinions of the previous rounds that are slightly skewed towards bearish, I will lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Still, I will adjust to make it slightly less bearish than the pure headline interpretation given that Apple's fundamental strength has been noted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, highlighting its strong financial position.  Key indicators like a low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow are all positive.  While the article mentions unspecified warning signs, the overwhelmingly positive portrayal of Apple's financial management is the dominant factor. Previous predictions show a divergence of opinions, influenced by other news sources and market sentiment. Some models emphasize Apple's strong fundamentals, while others highlight potential negative impacts from broader market shifts or external events.  To account for this uncertainty, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect the positive financial data in the article but also acknowledge the influence of other market forces beyond this single news piece.  The slight tilt towards a rise reflects the positive financial health showcased, while the non-zero probability of a fall acknowledges the uncertainty inherent in stock market prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from the Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues, which could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem. However, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and user experience suggests it may smoothly transition to a new partner. The potential disruption could cause short-term investor concern, but Apple's overall financial health and diversified revenue streams likely mitigate significant negative impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to the potential disruption, while others remain optimistic about Apple's resilience. Considering the mixed implications and Apple's ability to manage transitions, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a negative short-term impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against claims of no innovation since Steve Jobs' death suggests a neutral to positive outlook. However, the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not introduce new financial information or significant market-moving data. Considering the mixed views from previous predictions and the lack of significant negative news, a balanced estimate with a slight bias towards a positive view can be inferred.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in investor sentiment, suggesting that the 'Magnificent Seven' within the S&P 500 might be overvalued and that investors should consider other stocks within the index. While Apple (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', the news implies that investors might divest from it in favor of other undervalued and higher-growth potential stocks. The discussion about quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, points towards a potential negative sentiment towards Apple. The negative signals from previous rounds support a bearish outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
