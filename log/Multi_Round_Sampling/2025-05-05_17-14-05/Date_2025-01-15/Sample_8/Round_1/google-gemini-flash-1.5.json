(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is managing its debt levels conservatively while showing strong cash flow and profitability. The company's low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and the fact that it generates robust free cash flow further signal financial stability. Given these factors, the overall sentiment towards the company's debt management is positive, suggesting that the likelihood of the stock price rising is higher. However, potential warning signs noted might introduce some caution among investors. Despite this, the positive financial indicators outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of price increase compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' strongly suggests negative sentiment. Without access to the actual news content detailing the reasons 'why,' I must assume a generally pessimistic outlook. The use of the word 'hammered' indicates a potentially significant price decrease. While Apple is a strong company, negative news can still impact its stock price in the short term. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative use of debt, highlighting its strong financial position with low net debt, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow.  These are positive indicators of financial health and stability. While the article mentions two unspecified warning signs, the overall tone is highly positive regarding Apple's financial management.  Given the overwhelmingly positive financial picture painted in the article, a stock price rise is more likely than a fall in the short term. However, it's important to remember that this is just one factor influencing stock price, and other market forces could outweigh this positive news. The probabilities are therefore assigned based on this analysis, acknowledging the limitations of basing predictions solely on a single news article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. While this could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem in the short term, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and user experience suggests it may smoothly transition to a new partner. The potential disruption could cause some investor concern, but Apple's overall financial health and diversified revenue streams likely mitigate significant negative impact. Conversely, Goldman Sachs' core businesses are performing well, and exiting a loss-making venture could be viewed positively by investors. However, the news is more directly relevant to Apple's ecosystem.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically in response to claims that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer finds this claim 'inflammatory' and highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. While the article does not provide specific positive or negative financial data about Apple, Cramer's defense of the company's innovation suggests a neutral to positive outlook. However, the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not introduce new financial information or significant market-moving data. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards a positive view due to Cramer's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Cramer defends Apple against claims that the company has not innovated since Steve Jobs' death, finding such statements 'inflammatory.' However, the overall tone of the article does not significantly lean towards a positive or negative outlook on AAPL specifically due to this comment. The article mentions that AAPL ranks 3rd on the list of stocks Jim Cramer discussed and notes the potential of AAPL as an investment but suggests other AI stocks might hold greater promise. Given this context, the news is somewhat neutral but slightly positive for AAPL, as it defends the company against negative innovation claims without providing significant negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
