(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is managing its debt levels conservatively while showing strong cash flow and profitability. The company's low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and the fact that it generates robust free cash flow further signal financial stability. Given these factors, the overall sentiment towards the company's debt management is positive, suggesting that the likelihood of the stock price rising is higher. However, potential warning signs noted might introduce some caution among investors. Despite this, the positive financial indicators outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of price increase compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' strongly suggests negative sentiment. Without access to the actual news content detailing the reasons 'why,' I must assume a generally pessimistic outlook. The use of the word 'hammered' indicates a potentially significant price decrease. While Apple is a strong company, negative news can still impact its stock price in the short term. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative use of debt, highlighting its strong financial position with low net debt, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow.  These are positive indicators of financial health and stability. While the article mentions two unspecified warning signs, the overall tone is highly positive regarding Apple's financial management.  Given the overwhelmingly positive financial picture painted in the article, a stock price rise is more likely than a fall in the short term. However, it's important to remember that this is just one factor influencing stock price, and other market forces could outweigh this positive news. The probabilities are therefore assigned based on this analysis, acknowledging the limitations of basing predictions solely on a single news article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. While this could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem in the short term, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and user experience suggests it may smoothly transition to a new partner. The potential disruption could cause some investor concern, but Apple's overall financial health and diversified revenue streams likely mitigate significant negative impact. Conversely, Goldman Sachs' core businesses are performing well, and exiting a loss-making venture could be viewed positively by investors. However, the news is more directly relevant to Apple's ecosystem.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically in response to claims that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer finds this claim 'inflammatory' and highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. While the article does not provide specific positive or negative financial data about Apple, Cramer's defense of the company's innovation suggests a neutral to positive outlook. However, the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not introduce new financial information or significant market-moving data. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards a positive view due to Cramer's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Cramer defends Apple against claims that the company has not innovated since Steve Jobs' death, finding such statements 'inflammatory.' However, the overall tone of the article does not significantly lean towards a positive or negative outlook on AAPL specifically due to this comment. The article mentions that AAPL ranks 3rd on the list of stocks Jim Cramer discussed and notes the potential of AAPL as an investment but suggests other AI stocks might hold greater promise. Given this context, the news is somewhat neutral but slightly positive for AAPL, as it defends the company against negative innovation claims without providing significant negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, strong cash flow, and high interest coverage, which generally indicate solid financial health and stability. Despite two warning signs mentioned, the positive indicators of low net debt relative to earnings and robust free cash flow suggest that Apple is well-positioned to manage its obligations. These factors lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising. Conversely, previous predictions from others indicate some divided sentiment, but overall, the strong fundamentals discussed in the news provide a more bullish outlook. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to the stock price rising while acknowledging some risk factors that may lead to a lower probability of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" strongly suggests a negative outlook. While Apple is a strong company, such a stark warning usually precedes information likely to drive the stock price down. The previous rounds reflect differing opinions, with some models focusing on Apple's strong fundamentals while others prioritize the negative implications of the initial headline and other negative news such as Goldman Sachs' concerns about Apple Card partnership. Given all these clues, I am factoring in the strong negative signal of the headline and assign a consequently heightened probability for a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, presenting a positive outlook on its financial health.  Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow suggest strong financial stability. While the article mentions unspecified warning signs, the overwhelmingly positive portrayal of Apple's financial management overshadows these cautions.  However, the previous predictions show a divergence of opinions, ranging from strongly positive to strongly negative.  Some models highlight potential negative impacts from broader market shifts or unrelated news. While the article itself is bullish on Apple's debt management, it's crucial to acknowledge that stock prices are influenced by numerous factors beyond a single news item. To incorporate this uncertainty, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a more moderate estimate compared to a purely article-based assessment, acknowledging the potential for external factors and market sentiment to influence the price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. While this could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem in the short term, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and user experience suggests it may smoothly transition to a new partner. The potential disruption could cause some investor concern, but Apple's overall financial health and diversified revenue streams likely mitigate significant negative impact. Conversely, Goldman Sachs' core businesses are performing well, and exiting a loss-making venture could be viewed positively by investors. However, the news is more directly relevant to Apple's ecosystem. Given the mixed implications and Apple's resilience, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a negative short-term impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically his defense against claims that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer finds such claims 'inflammatory' and highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. While the article does not provide specific positive or negative financial data about Apple, Cramer's defense suggests a neutral to positive outlook. However, the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not introduce new financial information or significant market-moving data. The mixed predictions from previous models also suggest a balanced view, with slight biases towards a positive outlook due to Cramer's comments and the company's strong financial health.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he defends the company against claims that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer's comments are seen as positive for the company, but the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not introduce new financial information or significant market-moving data. Considering the mixed views from previous predictions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price rise and others to a fall, the overall sentiment seems balanced. However, given Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation and the lack of significant negative news, a slightly positive outlook can be inferred. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated with a slight bias towards a positive view.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks. Previous predictions show varied opinions, but most predictions point towards a bearish outlook. The recent underperformance of Apple relative to other major tech stocks aligns with this broader shift.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
