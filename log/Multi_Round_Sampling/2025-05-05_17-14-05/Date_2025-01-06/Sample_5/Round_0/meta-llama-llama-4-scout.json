(AAPL) as one of them. However, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is known to have a significant stake in Apple Inc. The lack of specific mention of AAPL in the headline does not necessarily imply a negative sentiment, as Buffett's investment in AAPL is well-documented. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling based on this neutral to slightly positive sentiment.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n\nNote that I have assumed a slightly positive sentiment, as Warren Buffett's investment in AAPL is seen as a vote of confidence by many investors. However, the news headline does not provide any specific catalyst for a significant stock price movement, hence the probabilities are close to 50-50."
