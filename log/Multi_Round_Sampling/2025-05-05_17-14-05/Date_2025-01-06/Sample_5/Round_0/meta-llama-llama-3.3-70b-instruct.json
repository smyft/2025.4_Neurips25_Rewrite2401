(AAPL) as one of those stocks. However, given Warren Buffett's historical investment strategies and his tendency to invest in strong,stable companies, if Apple were among those stocks, it could imply a positive outlook for the company. Without explicit mention, the direct impact on Apple's stock might be minimal, but the association with a renowned investor like Warren Buffett can indirectly influence investor confidence. Therefore, I estimate a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising due to the positive sentiment associated with Warren Buffett's investments, but the effect is likely to be muted since Apple is not explicitly mentioned.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
