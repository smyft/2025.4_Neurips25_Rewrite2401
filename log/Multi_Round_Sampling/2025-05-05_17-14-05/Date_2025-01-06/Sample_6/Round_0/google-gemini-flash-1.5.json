While this doesn't specify Apple's weighting within that 66%,  Warren Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed and often seen as a positive indicator by the market.  This news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to increased demand for Apple stock.  However, the impact is limited because the news is not specific to Apple and only reports on a general portfolio composition.  The market may react positively, but not dramatically.  There's also a chance the market will not react significantly or might have a muted response influenced by other market factors that are not mentioned in this specific news item.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2\n}\n```\n"
