While this doesn't specify Apple's weighting within that 66%, it's highly positive for Apple. Warren Buffett is a legendary investor, and his continued significant investment in Apple suggests strong confidence in its future performance.  This positive sentiment is likely to influence other investors, potentially driving up demand for Apple stock. However, the news itself is not specific enough to dramatically affect the stock price; the market may already have this information priced in. Therefore the probability of a price rise is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high.  The probability of a price fall is low, as the news is largely positive.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2\n}\n```\n"
