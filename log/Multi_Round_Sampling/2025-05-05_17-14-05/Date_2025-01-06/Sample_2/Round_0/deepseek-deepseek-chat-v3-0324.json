Buffett's investment decisions are closely watched by the market, and his continued confidence in AAPL could be perceived as a positive signal, potentially boosting investor sentiment. However, the headline alone does not provide specific details about changes in his position (e.g., whether he increased, decreased, or maintained his stake). Given Buffett's reputation and the general market reaction to his holdings, this news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on AAPL's stock price. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the 'Buffett effect,' but the lack of actionable details limits the magnitude of the impact.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
