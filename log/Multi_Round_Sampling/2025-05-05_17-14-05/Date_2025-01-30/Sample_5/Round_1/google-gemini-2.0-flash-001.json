      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\nNews Content: Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings miss analysts\u2019 estimates but the stock rises on optimism over the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s growth projections, Microsoft\u2019s Azure growth misses estimates, and Meta\u2019s fourth-quarter profit handily tops forecasts. Apple\u2019s quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is set to report its quarterly earnings, which typically has a significant impact on its stock price. Analysts often react strongly to earnings performance relative to expectations. The broader economic indicators such as GDP growth and home sales data may also impact market sentiment around tech stocks. Given the mixed sentiments around a slowing economy (with GDP growth expected to slow to 2.7%), there may be caution among investors. However, if Apple's earnings report meets or exceeds expectations, the stock price may rise. Thus, there is a reasonable probability of a price rise if the earnings are positive, but also substantial risk if the earnings disappoint, leading to a probability of price fall being significant as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates several major tech companies are experiencing significant stock movement based on their earnings reports. While Tesla's earnings missed estimates, its stock rose due to positive growth projections. Microsoft's Azure growth disappointed, and Meta exceeded profit forecasts. All of this suggests a mixed market sentiment for big tech. The critical piece of information is: \"Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday.\" This means the current prices do not reflect the earnings. The lack of any additional information regarding Apple implies: if their report is positive or surpasses expectations, the stock is likely to rise. Conversely, if the report is negative or misses expectations, the stock will likely fall. Considering that Apple is generally considered a strong company with a history of innovation and relatively stable earnings, I will assume that there's slightly higher chance of positive reporting. Hence, a very slight increase in the probablity of stock price rise. If the Apple's report were already released, then my answer would be based on reported results as was the case for other companies.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's strategy to mitigate risks associated with slowing growth in China by expanding into emerging markets like India and the Middle East.  This is a positive sign for long-term growth, as it demonstrates proactive diversification and the pursuit of new revenue streams. While this doesn't guarantee immediate stock price increases, it suggests potential for future growth.  The news itself is not likely to cause a significant immediate price drop. However, the market's overall sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will play a larger role in the short-term stock price movement. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the positive long-term implications of this strategic shift. However, the probabilities are relatively close, implying uncertainty due to external factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, which is generally a positive signal for the stock. However, the earnings surprise of 1.69% is relatively modest compared to the previous quarter's 10.07% surprise. Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates unfavorable earnings estimate revisions, suggesting potential underperformance in the near future. The stock has already underperformed the market year-to-date, losing 4.4% versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%. The sustainability of the stock's movement will depend on management's commentary during the earnings call. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive earnings beat but unfavorable estimate revisions and industry rank\u2014the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a negative reaction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's quarterly earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact the stock price. However, the headline does not provide specific details about the expected earnings performance. The overall market events include various tech and financial companies' earnings releases, Q4 GDP data, and home sales data. Given that Apple's earnings report is the focus, and without specific details on expected earnings, it's reasonable to assume a neutral to slightly positive bias due to the anticipation of the earnings report. However, the probabilities are not skewed heavily in either direction as the actual earnings results will dictate the stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, as a potential growth area. Since China's market is flagging, this strategic shift could help mitigate losses and potentially lead to revenue growth. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it demonstrates the company's proactive approach to adapting to changing market conditions and exploring new avenues for growth. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, a social media platform. This news does not directly affect Apple Inc. but there might be implications such as increased competition or market trends affecting both companies. The report states that Amazon was down 1% recently which might imply some uncertainty among investors. While it's uncertain how Apple will be affected directly, considering broader industry trends, there is less immediate cause for a significant change in Apple\u2019s stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Tesla's stock rose despite missing earnings estimates, fueled by growth projections optimism. Microsoft's Azure growth disappointed, and Meta exceeded expectations. Given this mixed sentiment in the tech sector and the fact that Apple's earnings are scheduled post-market, the market is holding its breath. The previous predictions vary significantly, perhaps due to different interpretations of external factors or early data I don't have. Several made an educated guess around 0.55 for rise due to Apple's general stability. However, one model's negative assessment, based on a low Zacks ranking and modest earnings surprise relative to the previous quarter, leans bearish. Seeing that the models I have access to have diverse opinions, I will slightly lean toward being optimistic of Apple outperforming even though the reports I am seeing here is more diverse. Thus, I will estimate the rise to be slightly more likely.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.60,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.40\n}\n```"
