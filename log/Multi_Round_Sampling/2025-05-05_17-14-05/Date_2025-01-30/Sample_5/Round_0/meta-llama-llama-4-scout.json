However, the headline does not provide specific details about the expected earnings performance. The overall market events include various tech and financial companies' earnings releases, Q4 GDP data, and home sales data. Given that Apple's earnings report is the focus, and without specific details on expected earnings, it's reasonable to assume a neutral to slightly positive bias due to the anticipation of the earnings report. However, the probabilities are not skewed heavily in either direction as the actual earnings results will dictate the stock price movement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple earnings, Q4 GDP data, home sales: What to Watch\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
