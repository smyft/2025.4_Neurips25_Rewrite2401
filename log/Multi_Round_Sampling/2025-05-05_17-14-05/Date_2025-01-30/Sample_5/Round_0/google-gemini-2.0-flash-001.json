While Tesla's earnings missed estimates, its stock rose due to positive growth projections. Microsoft's Azure growth disappointed, and Meta exceeded profit forecasts. All of this suggests a mixed market sentiment for big tech. The critical piece of information is: \\\"Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday.\\\" This means the current prices do not reflect the earnings. The lack of any additional information regarding Apple implies: if their report is positive or surpasses expectations, the stock is likely to rise. Conversely, if the report is negative or misses expectations, the stock will likely fall. Considering that Apple is generally considered a strong company with a history of innovation and relatively stable earnings, I will assume that there's slightly higher chance of positive reporting. Hence, a very slight increase in the probablity of stock price rise. If the Apple's report were already released, then my answer would be based on reported results as was the case for other companies.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
