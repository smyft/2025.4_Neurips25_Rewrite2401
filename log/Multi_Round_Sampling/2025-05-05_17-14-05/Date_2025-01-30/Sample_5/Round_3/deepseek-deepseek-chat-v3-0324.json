(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is set to report its quarterly earnings, which typically has a significant impact on its stock price. Analysts often react strongly to earnings performance relative to expectations. The broader economic indicators such as GDP growth and home sales data may also impact market sentiment around tech stocks. Given the mixed sentiments around a slowing economy (with GDP growth expected to slow to 2.7%), there may be caution among investors. However, if Apple's earnings report meets or exceeds expectations, the stock price may rise. Thus, there is a reasonable probability of a price rise if the earnings are positive, but also substantial risk if the earnings disappoint, leading to a probability of price fall being significant as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates several major tech companies are experiencing significant stock movement based on their earnings reports. While Tesla's earnings missed estimates, its stock rose due to positive growth projections. Microsoft's Azure growth disappointed, and Meta exceeded profit forecasts. All of this suggests a mixed market sentiment for big tech. The critical piece of information is: \"Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday.\" This means the current prices do not reflect the earnings. The lack of any additional information regarding Apple implies: if their report is positive or surpasses expectations, the stock is likely to rise. Conversely, if the report is negative or misses expectations, the stock will likely fall. Considering that Apple is generally considered a strong company with a history of innovation and relatively stable earnings, I will assume that there's slightly higher chance of positive reporting. Hence, a very slight increase in the probablity of stock price rise. If the Apple's report were already released, then my answer would be based on reported results as was the case for other companies.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's strategy to mitigate risks associated with slowing growth in China by expanding into emerging markets like India and the Middle East.  This is a positive sign for long-term growth, as it demonstrates proactive diversification and the pursuit of new revenue streams. While this doesn't guarantee immediate stock price increases, it suggests potential for future growth.  The news itself is not likely to cause a significant immediate price drop. However, the market's overall sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will play a larger role in the short-term stock price movement. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the positive long-term implications of this strategic shift. However, the probabilities are relatively close, implying uncertainty due to external factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, which is generally a positive signal for the stock. However, the earnings surprise of 1.69% is relatively modest compared to the previous quarter's 10.07% surprise. Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates unfavorable earnings estimate revisions, suggesting potential underperformance in the near future. The stock has already underperformed the market year-to-date, losing 4.4% versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%. The sustainability of the stock's movement will depend on management's commentary during the earnings call. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive earnings beat but unfavorable estimate revisions and industry rank\u2014the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a negative reaction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's quarterly earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact the stock price. However, the headline does not provide specific details about the expected earnings performance. The overall market events include various tech and financial companies' earnings releases, Q4 GDP data, and home sales data. Given that Apple's earnings report is the focus, and without specific details on expected earnings, it's reasonable to assume a neutral to slightly positive bias due to the anticipation of the earnings report. However, the probabilities are not skewed heavily in either direction as the actual earnings results will dictate the stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, as a potential growth area. Since China's market is flagging, this strategic shift could help mitigate losses and potentially lead to revenue growth. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it demonstrates the company's proactive approach to adapting to changing market conditions and exploring new avenues for growth. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, a social media platform. This news does not directly affect Apple Inc. but there might be implications such as increased competition or market trends affecting both companies. The report states that Amazon was down 1% recently which might imply some uncertainty among investors. While it's uncertain how Apple will be affected directly, considering broader industry trends, there is less immediate cause for a significant change in Apple\u2019s stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. is a significant event that generally leads to heightened volatility in stock prices. With mixed sentiments in the market driven by broader economic indicators like expected GDP growth slowing to 2.7% and pending home sales data, there remains caution among investors. Recent predictions showcase a range of opinions with probabilities for a rise mostly clustering around 0.55, while a few lean towards a slight fall probability. Given Apple's strong reputation for innovation and potential for exceeding earnings expectations, I estimate a slightly higher probability for the stock price to rise. However, concerns about economic trends and past underperformance might weigh down sentiment. Therefore, I place the probabilities at 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on major tech companies and their earnings reports, setting the stage for Apple's upcoming report. Tesla's stock rose despite missing earnings estimates, fueled by growth projections optimism. Microsoft's Azure growth disappointed, and Meta exceeded expectations. Given this mixed sentiment in the tech sector and the fact that Apple's earnings are scheduled post-market, the market is holding its breath. The previous predictions vary significantly, perhaps due to different interpretations of external factors or early data I don't have. Several made an educated guess around 0.55 for rise due to Apple's general stability. However, one model's negative assessment, based on a low Zacks ranking and modest earnings surprise relative to the previous quarter, leans bearish. Seeing that the models I have access to have diverse opinions, I will slightly lean toward being optimistic of Apple outperforming even though the reports I am seeing here is more diverse. Thus, I will estimate the rise to be slightly more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's expansion into emerging markets to offset potential losses in China. This is a positive long-term strategy, suggesting resilience and future growth potential.  However, the news itself doesn't provide immediate impetus for a price movement. The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the inherent uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price before an earnings release, and varying interpretations of market sentiment and macroeconomic factors.  The probabilities given by other models range from a slight bias towards a price increase to a slight bias towards a price decrease, with most models favoring a roughly equal chance of either outcome. Considering the long-term positive implications of the news and the generally positive outlook on Apple, while also acknowledging the inherent uncertainty before earnings, I'm slightly more optimistic.  The absence of specific information regarding earnings makes it difficult to assign a high probability to either outcome. Therefore, I'm adjusting probabilities based on the average of the earlier predictions, slightly tilting towards an increase considering the positive implications of the news on Apple's strategic outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, which is a positive signal. However, the earnings surprise of only +1.69% (vs. +10.07% last quarter) and revenue surprise of +0.24% are relatively modest. While the company has consistently beaten estimates in recent quarters, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests unfavorable earnings estimate revisions, and the industry is in the bottom quartile. The stock has already underperformed YTD (-4.4% vs. S&P +2.7%), indicating negative momentum. The immediate price movement will depend on management's commentary. Overall, the modest beat may not be enough to trigger meaningful upside given the negative earnings revision trend and weak industry outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, as a potential growth area. This strategic shift could help mitigate losses and potentially lead to revenue growth. Given this positive development and considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a slight inclination towards a price rise and others towards a fall, it's reasonable to assume a neutral to slightly positive bias. The probabilities are not skewed heavily in either direction, as the actual impact of this strategy on earnings and the overall market sentiment will dictate the stock price movement. However, the proactive approach to adapting to changing market conditions and exploring new avenues for growth is likely to be viewed positively by investors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Amazon's increased advertisement spending on X and the potential return of Apple to this platform. There is no direct information on the financial performance or strategic initiatives of Apple Inc. beyond the potential strategy to test ads on X. Previous rounds predict mixed sentiments towards the market and Apple's upcoming earnings report as key factors influencing its stock price. The news about Amazon and X does not seem to directly translate to Apple's stock price movement probabilities without considering broader implications such as market trends or competitive strategies. Given the mixed signals provided by previous models and the absence of concrete details about Apple's earnings report expectations, the probabilities are estimated based on cautious optimism.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. is a critical event likely to create volatility in its stock price. While there is anticipation that Apple may exceed earnings expectations given its historic stability and innovation, broader economic factors, such as a projected slowing GDP growth, introduce caution among investors. Previous predictions reveal a range of probabilities, largely clustering around a slightly higher chance of a price rise (around 0.55 to 0.60). Considering the strategic focus on emerging markets, the company\u2019s history of outperforming estimates, and the mixed market sentiment from other tech earnings, I estimate a probability of 0.57 for a price rise and 0.43 for a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report alongside reports from other major tech companies. The varied reactions to those reports (Tesla up despite earnings miss, Microsoft down on Azure growth, Meta up on profit) highlight the uncertainty surrounding earnings. Most past models assigned around a 55/45 split in favor of a rise, reflecting Apple's general stability. The model that predicted a fall did so based on a relatively small recent earnings surprise (+1.69% vs +10.07% QoQ), a Zacks Sell rating, and YTD underperformance. Given that the news explicitly states the report is *after* the bell, it's very hard for the price to move much *before* the report. Because these are pre-earnings predictions and I have no concrete information about the earnings report, but the bulk of signals point slightly positive, I'm weighting my probability a bit higher towards a positive movement. The models predicting on Amazon's X ad spend are basically irrelevant. Since there is no direct positive or negative info for Apple I will assume the news is likely to push for equilibrium towards a long term trend if there is limited time for people to react.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's diversification strategy into emerging markets to counter slowing growth in China. This is a long-term positive, but its immediate impact on stock price is uncertain.  The previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 for a price rise, reflecting the market's pre-earnings report uncertainty.  The lack of specific earnings information makes precise prediction difficult. Considering the generally positive long-term outlook for Apple and the proactive nature of their strategy, a slight bias towards a price increase is warranted. However, the significant spread in prior predictions emphasizes the considerable uncertainty.  I'm therefore weighting the probabilities towards the average of the previous rounds' predictions, slightly favoring a rise due to the positive news, while acknowledging the substantial uncertainty inherent in predicting stock price movements before earnings reports.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, which is generally a positive signal. However, the earnings surprise was modest at 1.69% compared to the previous quarter's 10.07%. Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates unfavorable earnings estimate revisions, and the industry is in the bottom quartile. The stock has underperformed the market YTD (-4.4% vs. S&P +2.7%), suggesting negative momentum. While the earnings beat is positive, the modest surprise and unfavorable revisions temper expectations. Management's commentary during the earnings call will be crucial, but the current data suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to these mixed signals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, as a potential growth area.
