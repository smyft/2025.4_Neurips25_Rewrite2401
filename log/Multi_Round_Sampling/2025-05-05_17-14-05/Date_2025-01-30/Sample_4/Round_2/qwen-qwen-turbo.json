(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple reports record earnings, but misses on iPhone estimates\nNews Content: Apple CEO Tim Cook on September 12, 2023 in Cupertino, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) met Wall Street\u2019s expectations with fiscal first-quarter earnings driven by the holiday season.\n\nThe iPhone maker reported revenues of $124.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 \u2014 a 4% increase year over year. Apple reported earnings per share of $2.41, and net income of $36.3 billion.\n\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cWe were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal.\u201d\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Apple was also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion.\n\nDespite being the company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter ever,\u201d Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nApple shares were up by more than 3% in after-hours trading after the company said on its earnings call it expects \u201clow to mid single digits\u201d growth on an annual basis for the March quarter. Analysts expected guidance of $95.6 billion for revenue, and $1.66 for earnings per share, according to FactSet\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 0.74% at the market close on Thursday, and are down by 5.1% so far this year.\n\nCook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call it will roll out more languages for Apple Intelligence in April, and that most customers are currently using artificial intelligence features such as Writing Tools and Image Playground.\n\nEarlier this month, Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform,\u201d citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first-quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nThe company rolled out the Apple Intelligence features in October, which \u201chas yet to gain traction with consumers,\u201d Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it was \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has surpassed earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are concerns regarding unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting that the stock may underperform in the near future. The overall industry outlook is also weak, with Apple's sector in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. Taking these factors into account, the probability of the stock price falling may be higher than the probability of it rising immediately following this earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). Positive aspects include a 6% revenue growth driven by new product launches and AI integration, specifically Apple Intelligence. The company is also recognized as one of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. However, concerns are raised about hedge funds reducing their technology holdings and the emergence of Chinese AI competitors like DeepSeek, which are causing downward pressure on tech futures. While Goldman Sachs remains overall bullish on AI and acknowledges Apple's strong performance, the article also suggests that some investors are nervous about AI sustainability in the long term. Also, the note is that AAPL may underperform other peers. The cautious approach of hedge funds and regulatory uncertainties contribute to overall uncertainty. Balancing the positive revenue growth and AI integration with market-wide anxieties, a slight upward probability of the stock is presented.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of best stocks for beginners and mentions positive aspects like strong services revenue, a large device user base, and potential AI-driven revenue streams, it also acknowledges significant headwinds.  These include a decline in Chinese shipments, the overall cautious market outlook predicted by Tom Lee (which includes a potential market pullback in the second half of 2025), and the article's own admission that other AI stocks may offer higher returns.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only the 3rd best stock further tempers the bullish sentiment. The overall market forecast is modestly positive (8% increase in S&P 500), but with considerable caveats. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so.  The uncertainty around the market outlook and Apple's performance in China contribute to a lower probability of a significant price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets like India and the Middle East, which are significant growth areas for smartphone sales. This strategic emphasis could be seen positively by investors, as it suggests potential for revenue diversification and growth beyond China, which has been a concern. However, the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth numbers in the news might limit the immediate bullish impact. Overall, the sentiment appears slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is listed among the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. The article highlights Apple's strong performance, with a 262% stock price gain over the last five years, and a forecasted 6% growth rate for 2025. Additionally, Apple's expansive platform for AI services and potential for AI-driven subscription services are seen as positive factors. However, the article also mentions challenges such as declining shipments in China. Overall, the positive factors seem to outweigh the negative, but the cautious tone from Tom Lee's market outlook for 2025, including potential pullbacks, suggests a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has expressed a positive view towards DeepSeek, an AI model from China, stating that innovation driving efficiency is a 'good thing'. This statement does not directly imply any significant impact on Apple's financial performance or stock price. However, it suggests that Apple is open to external innovation, which might be perceived positively by investors. Given the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a more substantial influence on Apple's stock price than this single statement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for revenues and earnings per share. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical component of their business. Additionally, the guidance for the next quarter suggests low to mid-single digit growth, which could be seen as modest compared to previous quarters. The recent downgrade by Jefferies and concerns over hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The earnings report spotlighted by the news is positive, showing that Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the recent quarter. However, the unfavorable estimate revisions and the Zacks Rank of #4 ('Sell') suggest ongoing concerns about future performance, leading to expectations of underperformance relative to the market. There is also an overarching weak industry outlook that tempers enthusiasm. Given these mixed signals, while the earnings beat is a positive indicator, the overall sentiment points toward a likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall slightly positive outlook for Apple. The 6% revenue growth and integration of AI are strong positives. However, concerns about hedge fund activity and competition, particularly from DeepSeek, create uncertainty. Goldman Sachs' bullish perspective on AI is supportive, but the cautionary notes regarding regulatory complexities and the wait-and-see approach of hedge funds temper enthusiasm. The previous prediction rounds are varied, reflecting this complexity, but the most recent ones lean slightly towards the negative side. Considering these factors and noting there may be some negative sentiment floating around, I estimate rise/fall probabilities of 0.5/0.5. However the overall sentiment of the article pushes for slightly higher price point in general.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While it's touted as a good stock for beginners, and highlights positive aspects like revenue growth, a large user base, and AI potential, significant concerns exist.  The decline in Chinese shipments is a major negative, as is the generally cautious market outlook for 2025 predicted by Tom Lee, including a potential second-half pullback.  The article itself acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer better returns, further dampening enthusiasm for AAPL.  Although Apple's inclusion in a list of top stocks and its ongoing revenue growth suggest some upward pressure, the significant challenges and the overall market uncertainty outweigh these positives. The previous predictions range from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, reflecting this inherent uncertainty. Considering all factors, I place a slightly higher probability on a price rise than a price fall, reflecting the balance of positive and negative factors, but acknowledge the considerable uncertainty inherent in this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic focus on emerging markets like India and the Middle East, which could be seen as a positive move to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependence on China. However, the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth metrics in the news might limit the immediate bullish impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong performance and AI potential, while others are cautious due to concerns about China's market and modest growth guidance. Overall, the sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, given the lack of new, compelling data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has expressed a positive view towards DeepSeek, an AI model from China, stating that innovation driving efficiency is a 'good thing'. This statement suggests that Apple is open to external innovation, which might be perceived positively by investors. However, the overall impact of this statement on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it does not directly imply any significant changes to the company's financial performance. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising and others indicating a higher probability of it falling, the overall sentiment appears to be moderately positive but uncertain. Taking into account the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement and the mixed market sentiment, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
