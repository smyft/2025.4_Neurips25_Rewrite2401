(AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has surpassed earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are concerns regarding unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting that the stock may underperform in the near future. The overall industry outlook is also weak, with Apple's sector in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. Taking these factors into account, the probability of the stock price falling may be higher than the probability of it rising immediately following this earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). Positive aspects include a 6% revenue growth driven by new product launches and AI integration, specifically Apple Intelligence. The company is also recognized as one of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. However, concerns are raised about hedge funds reducing their technology holdings and the emergence of Chinese AI competitors like DeepSeek, which are causing downward pressure on tech futures. While Goldman Sachs remains overall bullish on AI and acknowledges Apple's strong performance, the article also suggests that some investors are nervous about AI sustainability in the long term. Also, the note is that AAPL may underperform other peers. The cautious approach of hedge funds and regulatory uncertainties contribute to overall uncertainty. Balancing the positive revenue growth and AI integration with market-wide anxieties, a slight upward probability of the stock is presented.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of best stocks for beginners and mentions positive aspects like strong services revenue, a large device user base, and potential AI-driven revenue streams, it also acknowledges significant headwinds.  These include a decline in Chinese shipments, the overall cautious market outlook predicted by Tom Lee (which includes a potential market pullback in the second half of 2025), and the article's own admission that other AI stocks may offer higher returns.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only the 3rd best stock further tempers the bullish sentiment. The overall market forecast is modestly positive (8% increase in S&P 500), but with considerable caveats. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so.  The uncertainty around the market outlook and Apple's performance in China contribute to a lower probability of a significant price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets like India and the Middle East, which are significant growth areas for smartphone sales. This strategic emphasis could be seen positively by investors, as it suggests potential for revenue diversification and growth beyond China, which has been a concern. However, the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth numbers in the news might limit the immediate bullish impact. Overall, the sentiment appears slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is listed among the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. The article highlights Apple's strong performance, with a 262% stock price gain over the last five years, and a forecasted 6% growth rate for 2025. Additionally, Apple's expansive platform for AI services and potential for AI-driven subscription services are seen as positive factors. However, the article also mentions challenges such as declining shipments in China. Overall, the positive factors seem to outweigh the negative, but the cautious tone from Tom Lee's market outlook for 2025, including potential pullbacks, suggests a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has expressed a positive view towards DeepSeek, an AI model from China, stating that innovation driving efficiency is a 'good thing'. This statement does not directly imply any significant impact on Apple's financial performance or stock price. However, it suggests that Apple is open to external innovation, which might be perceived positively by investors. Given the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a more substantial influence on Apple's stock price than this single statement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for revenues and earnings per share. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical component of their business. Additionally, the guidance for the next quarter suggests low to mid-single digit growth, which could be seen as modest compared to previous quarters. The recent downgrade by Jefferies and concerns over hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The earnings report spotlighted by the news is positive, showing that Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the recent quarter. However, the unfavorable estimate revisions and the Zacks Rank of #4 ('Sell') suggest ongoing concerns about future performance, leading to expectations of underperformance relative to the market. There is also an overarching weak industry outlook that tempers enthusiasm. Given these mixed signals, while the earnings beat is a positive indicator, the overall sentiment points toward a likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall slightly positive outlook for Apple. The 6% revenue growth and integration of AI are strong positives. However, concerns about hedge fund activity and competition, particularly from DeepSeek, create uncertainty. Goldman Sachs' bullish perspective on AI is supportive, but the cautionary notes regarding regulatory complexities and the wait-and-see approach of hedge funds temper enthusiasm. The previous prediction rounds are varied, reflecting this complexity, but the most recent ones lean slightly towards the negative side. Considering these factors and noting there may be some negative sentiment floating around, I estimate rise/fall probabilities of 0.5/0.5. However the overall sentiment of the article pushes for slightly higher price point in general.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While it's touted as a good stock for beginners, and highlights positive aspects like revenue growth, a large user base, and AI potential, significant concerns exist.  The decline in Chinese shipments is a major negative, as is the generally cautious market outlook for 2025 predicted by Tom Lee, including a potential second-half pullback.  The article itself acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer better returns, further dampening enthusiasm for AAPL.  Although Apple's inclusion in a list of top stocks and its ongoing revenue growth suggest some upward pressure, the significant challenges and the overall market uncertainty outweigh these positives. The previous predictions range from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, reflecting this inherent uncertainty. Considering all factors, I place a slightly higher probability on a price rise than a price fall, reflecting the balance of positive and negative factors, but acknowledge the considerable uncertainty inherent in this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic focus on emerging markets like India and the Middle East, which could be seen as a positive move to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependence on China. However, the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth metrics in the news might limit the immediate bullish impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong performance and AI potential, while others are cautious due to concerns about China's market and modest growth guidance. Overall, the sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, given the lack of new, compelling data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has expressed a positive view towards DeepSeek, an AI model from China, stating that innovation driving efficiency is a 'good thing'. This statement suggests that Apple is open to external innovation, which might be perceived positively by investors. However, the overall impact of this statement on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it does not directly imply any significant changes to the company's financial performance. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising and others indicating a higher probability of it falling, the overall sentiment appears to be moderately positive but uncertain. Taking into account the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement and the mixed market sentiment, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report is a mixed bag. While the company has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates, which is a positive indicator, the underlying sentiment is tempered by unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating that the stock may underperform in the near term. The wider industry outlook for the Computer - Micro Computers sector is also weak, being in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. These factors collectively suggest that while the immediate performance shows strength, the market may react cautiously due to broader concerns about the stock's future performance. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The key highlights include a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 driven by new product launches and AI integration (Apple Intelligence). Goldman Sachs identifies Apple as an AI superstar and remains bullish on AI futures. However, hedge funds have been reducing their positions in technology stocks, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector due to competition from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Regulatory complexities are also contributing to market volatility, leading to a cautious approach from hedge funds. There are some hedge funds taking long positions, but the majority are selling. The previous predictions vary, showing that the information is not definitively leading one direction or the other. Considering the conflicting signals, the increase in the price seems very unlikely. I am lowering my estimated probability of a price increase from the predictions in Round 1.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While it's positioned as a good stock for beginners, highlighting positive aspects like revenue growth (6%), a large user base, and AI potential, significant concerns exist. The decline in Chinese shipments (17% annually, 25% in Q4 2024) is a major negative, as is the generally cautious market outlook for 2025 from Tom Lee, including a potential second-half pullback.  The article itself acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer better returns, further dampening enthusiasm for AAPL.  The prediction from various models ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, reflecting inherent uncertainty.  While Apple's inclusion in a top stocks list and revenue growth suggest some upward pressure, the significant challenges and market uncertainty outweigh these positives. The overall market sentiment appears slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, given the lack of new, compelling financial data beyond revenue growth. Considering past predictions' trend toward slightly lower probabilities of a price increase, and the significant negative aspect of declining Chinese shipments, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic focus on emerging markets like India and the Middle East, which could be seen as a positive move to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependence on China. However, the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth metrics in the news might limit the immediate bullish impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong performance and AI potential, while others are cautious due to concerns about China's market and modest growth guidance. Overall, the sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, given the lack of new, compelling data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but overall positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). It highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners, citing a 6% forecasted growth rate for 2025, a large user base of over 2.2 billion devices, and potential AI-driven revenue streams. However, it also mentions significant headwinds such as a 17% decline in annual shipments in China in fiscal year 2024 and a cautious market outlook for 2025. Previous predictions from various models range from 0.4 to 0.6 for the probability of the stock price rising, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. Considering the balance of positive factors like revenue growth and AI potential against negative factors like Chinese market challenges and modest growth guidance, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, views DeepSeek's innovation as a 'good thing' suggests a neutral to mildly positive tone. This statement does not directly imply any significant impact on Apple's financial performance or stock price. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the overall market sentiment, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low. The company's recent earnings report and revenue growth are strong positives, but concerns about China's market, modest growth guidance, and competition from other AI models create uncertainty. Taking into account the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement and the mixed market sentiment, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple met Wall Street's expectations with earnings and revenues, showing strong performance in the latest quarter. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which highlights a critical component of their business. The guidance for the following quarter suggests low to mid-single-digit growth, considered modest. Recent analyst actions and concerns about hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment. Despite some positive aspects, such as AI integration and revenue growth, the overall sentiment leans towards caution due to missed estimates and market concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
