(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has surpassed earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are concerns regarding unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting that the stock may underperform in the near future. The overall industry outlook is also weak, with Apple's sector in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. Taking these factors into account, the probability of the stock price falling may be higher than the probability of it rising immediately following this earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). Positive aspects include a 6% revenue growth driven by new product launches and AI integration, specifically Apple Intelligence. The company is also recognized as one of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. However, concerns are raised about hedge funds reducing their technology holdings and the emergence of Chinese AI competitors like DeepSeek, which are causing downward pressure on tech futures. While Goldman Sachs remains overall bullish on AI and acknowledges Apple's strong performance, the article also suggests that some investors are nervous about AI sustainability in the long term. Also, the note is that AAPL may underperform other peers. The cautious approach of hedge funds and regulatory uncertainties contribute to overall uncertainty. Balancing the positive revenue growth and AI integration with market-wide anxieties, a slight upward probability of the stock is presented.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of best stocks for beginners and mentions positive aspects like strong services revenue, a large device user base, and potential AI-driven revenue streams, it also acknowledges significant headwinds.  These include a decline in Chinese shipments, the overall cautious market outlook predicted by Tom Lee (which includes a potential market pullback in the second half of 2025), and the article's own admission that other AI stocks may offer higher returns.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only the 3rd best stock further tempers the bullish sentiment. The overall market forecast is modestly positive (8% increase in S&P 500), but with considerable caveats. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so.  The uncertainty around the market outlook and Apple's performance in China contribute to a lower probability of a significant price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets like India and the Middle East, which are significant growth areas for smartphone sales. This strategic emphasis could be seen positively by investors, as it suggests potential for revenue diversification and growth beyond China, which has been a concern. However, the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth numbers in the news might limit the immediate bullish impact. Overall, the sentiment appears slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is listed among the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. The article highlights Apple's strong performance, with a 262% stock price gain over the last five years, and a forecasted 6% growth rate for 2025. Additionally, Apple's expansive platform for AI services and potential for AI-driven subscription services are seen as positive factors. However, the article also mentions challenges such as declining shipments in China. Overall, the positive factors seem to outweigh the negative, but the cautious tone from Tom Lee's market outlook for 2025, including potential pullbacks, suggests a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has expressed a positive view towards DeepSeek, an AI model from China, stating that innovation driving efficiency is a 'good thing'. This statement does not directly imply any significant impact on Apple's financial performance or stock price. However, it suggests that Apple is open to external innovation, which might be perceived positively by investors. Given the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a more substantial influence on Apple's stock price than this single statement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for revenues and earnings per share. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical component of their business. Additionally, the guidance for the next quarter suggests low to mid-single digit growth, which could be seen as modest compared to previous quarters. The recent downgrade by Jefferies and concerns over hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The earnings report spotlighted by the news is positive, showing that Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the recent quarter. However, the unfavorable estimate revisions and the Zacks Rank of #4 ('Sell') suggest ongoing concerns about future performance, leading to expectations of underperformance relative to the market. There is also an overarching weak industry outlook that tempers enthusiasm. Given these mixed signals, while the earnings beat is a positive indicator, the overall sentiment points toward a likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall slightly positive outlook for Apple. The 6% revenue growth and integration of AI are strong positives. However, concerns about hedge fund activity and competition, particularly from DeepSeek, create uncertainty. Goldman Sachs' bullish perspective on AI is supportive, but the cautionary notes regarding regulatory complexities and the wait-and-see approach of hedge funds temper enthusiasm. The previous prediction rounds are varied, reflecting this complexity, but the most recent ones lean slightly towards the negative side. Considering these factors and noting there may be some negative sentiment floating around, I estimate rise/fall probabilities of 0.5/0.5. However the overall sentiment of the article pushes for slightly higher price point in general.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While it's touted as a good stock for beginners, and highlights positive aspects like revenue growth, a large user base, and AI potential, significant concerns exist.  The decline in Chinese shipments is a major negative, as is the generally cautious market outlook for 2025 predicted by Tom Lee, including a potential second-half pullback.  The article itself acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer better returns, further dampening enthusiasm for AAPL.  Although Apple's inclusion in a list of top stocks and its ongoing revenue growth suggest some upward pressure, the significant challenges and the overall market uncertainty outweigh these positives. The previous predictions range from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, reflecting this inherent uncertainty. Considering all factors, I place a slightly higher probability on a price rise than a price fall, reflecting the balance of positive and negative factors, but acknowledge the considerable uncertainty inherent in this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic focus on emerging markets like India and the Middle East, which could be seen as a positive move to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependence on China. However, the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth metrics in the news might limit the immediate bullish impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong performance and AI potential, while others are cautious due to concerns about China's market and modest growth guidance. Overall, the sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, given the lack of new, compelling data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has expressed a positive view towards DeepSeek, an AI model from China, stating that innovation driving efficiency is a 'good thing'. This statement suggests that Apple is open to external innovation, which might be perceived positively by investors. However, the overall impact of this statement on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it does not directly imply any significant changes to the company's financial performance. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising and others indicating a higher probability of it falling, the overall sentiment appears to be moderately positive but uncertain. Taking into account the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement and the mixed market sentiment, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report is a mixed bag. While the company has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates, which is a positive indicator, the underlying sentiment is tempered by unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating that the stock may underperform in the near term. The wider industry outlook for the Computer - Micro Computers sector is also weak, being in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. These factors collectively suggest that while the immediate performance shows strength, the market may react cautiously due to broader concerns about the stock's future performance. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The key highlights include a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 driven by new product launches and AI integration (Apple Intelligence). Goldman Sachs identifies Apple as an AI superstar and remains bullish on AI futures. However, hedge funds have been reducing their positions in technology stocks, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector due to competition from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Regulatory complexities are also contributing to market volatility, leading to a cautious approach from hedge funds. There are some hedge funds taking long positions, but the majority are selling. The previous predictions vary, showing that the information is not definitively leading one direction or the other. Considering the conflicting signals, the increase in the price seems very unlikely. I am lowering my estimated probability of a price increase from the predictions in Round 1.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While it's positioned as a good stock for beginners, highlighting positive aspects like revenue growth (6%), a large user base, and AI potential, significant concerns exist. The decline in Chinese shipments (17% annually, 25% in Q4 2024) is a major negative, as is the generally cautious market outlook for 2025 from Tom Lee, including a potential second-half pullback.  The article itself acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer better returns, further dampening enthusiasm for AAPL.  The prediction from various models ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, reflecting inherent uncertainty.  While Apple's inclusion in a top stocks list and revenue growth suggest some upward pressure, the significant challenges and market uncertainty outweigh these positives. The overall market sentiment appears slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, given the lack of new, compelling financial data beyond revenue growth. Considering past predictions' trend toward slightly lower probabilities of a price increase, and the significant negative aspect of declining Chinese shipments, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic focus on emerging markets like India and the Middle East, which could be seen as a positive move to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependence on China. However, the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth metrics in the news might limit the immediate bullish impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong performance and AI potential, while others are cautious due to concerns about China's market and modest growth guidance. Overall, the sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, given the lack of new, compelling data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but overall positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). It highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners, citing a 6% forecasted growth rate for 2025, a large user base of over 2.2 billion devices, and potential AI-driven revenue streams. However, it also mentions significant headwinds such as a 17% decline in annual shipments in China in fiscal year 2024 and a cautious market outlook for 2025. Previous predictions from various models range from 0.4 to 0.6 for the probability of the stock price rising, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. Considering the balance of positive factors like revenue growth and AI potential against negative factors like Chinese market challenges and modest growth guidance, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, views DeepSeek's innovation as a 'good thing' suggests a neutral to mildly positive tone. This statement does not directly imply any significant impact on Apple's financial performance or stock price. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the overall market sentiment, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low. The company's recent earnings report and revenue growth are strong positives, but concerns about China's market, modest growth guidance, and competition from other AI models create uncertainty. Taking into account the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement and the mixed market sentiment, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple met Wall Street's expectations with earnings and revenues, showing strong performance in the latest quarter. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which highlights a critical component of their business. The guidance for the following quarter suggests low to mid-single-digit growth, considered modest. Recent analyst actions and concerns about hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment. Despite some positive aspects, such as AI integration and revenue growth, the overall sentiment leans towards caution due to missed estimates and market concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
