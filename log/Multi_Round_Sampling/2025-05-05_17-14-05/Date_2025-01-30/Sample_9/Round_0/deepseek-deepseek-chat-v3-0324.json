This suggests strong market penetration and potential for further growth by cross-selling other Apple products like Mac, iPad, or Watch. Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. The probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.7,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.1\n}\n```"
