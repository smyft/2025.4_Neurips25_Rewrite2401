      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\nNews Content: Apple is a mature company, and it revealed in its first-quarter earnings call that its installed base of devices had reached over 2.35 billion. The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices. The numbers suggest that Apple could still have room to grow its base by convincing iPhone owners to buy a Mac, iPad, or Watch.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a bullish outlook for the stock market in 2025, particularly for large-cap companies like Apple Inc. Given its favorable ranking among stocks for beginners and its robust growth potential in AI services, there is a strong likelihood of price appreciation despite recent struggles in the Chinese market. The overall market forecast from Tom Lee supports a positive sentiment for AAPL. However, potential risks such as government efficiency initiatives and tariffs may impact sentiment. Balancing these factors, it's estimated that the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increasing its scrutiny of Australian pension fund liquidity risks. While this doesn't directly impact Apple's operations, the analysis suggests potential indirect effects. A significant financial shock in Australia, a key market for Apple, could negatively influence consumer spending and investment. Heightened scrutiny and regulatory adjustments could indirectly impact market sentiment. However, Apple is a global company with diversified revenue streams. Therefore, while a major Australian financial crisis could have *some* impact, it's unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in Apple's stock price. The 'Most Read' articles within the news piece relate to Manhattan traffic, Trump's policies, housing aid, and reading scores, none of which directly affect Apple. Similarly, the Businessweek headlines discuss skiing, Trump's backers, Tesla sales, Buc-ee's gas stations, and fertility treatments - all irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock performance. The RBA comments are focused on domestic Australian financial system risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates strong iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence, suggesting a positive correlation between the software and product demand.  This is a bullish signal, implying increased consumer interest and potentially higher revenue for Apple.  However, the news is specific to certain markets and doesn't provide overall sales figures or address other potential factors that could impact stock price, such as macroeconomic conditions or competition.  Therefore, while the news is generally positive, the impact on the stock price is not guaranteed to be significant or solely positive. A rise is more likely than a fall, but there's still a possibility of a price decrease due to other market factors or investor sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong market penetration and potential for further growth by cross-selling other Apple products like Mac, iPad, or Watch. Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. The probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact the stock price. The article also mentions that several other tech and financial companies are releasing their quarterly earnings results, which could contribute to overall market sentiment. However, there is no specific information in the headline or article that would strongly suggest a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are based on the general expectation that earnings reports can lead to stock price movements, but the direction is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is looking to emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, to compensate for flagging performance in China. This diversification strategy could lead to increased revenue and growth opportunities, potentially positively impacting the stock price. However, the news does not provide any concrete numbers or guarantees of success, and the challenges of expanding into new markets should not be underestimated. Given this, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are not extremely high due to the uncertainties involved.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
