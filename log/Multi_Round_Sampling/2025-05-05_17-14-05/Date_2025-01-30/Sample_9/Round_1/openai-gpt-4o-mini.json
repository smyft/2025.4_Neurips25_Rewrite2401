(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple (AAPL) Is the Best Stock to Buy in 2025 for Beginners\nNews Content: We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%.

The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone.

It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a bullish outlook for the stock market in 2025, particularly for large-cap companies like Apple Inc. Given its favorable ranking among stocks for beginners and its robust growth potential in AI services, there is a strong likelihood of price appreciation despite recent struggles in the Chinese market. The overall market forecast from Tom Lee supports a positive sentiment for AAPL. However, potential risks such as government efficiency initiatives and tariffs may impact sentiment. Balancing these factors, it's estimated that the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increasing its scrutiny of Australian pension fund liquidity risks. While this doesn't directly impact Apple's operations, the analysis suggests potential indirect effects. A significant financial shock in Australia, a key market for Apple, could negatively influence consumer spending and investment. Heightened scrutiny and regulatory adjustments could indirectly impact market sentiment. However, Apple is a global company with diversified revenue streams. Therefore, while a major Australian financial crisis could have *some* impact, it's unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in Apple's stock price. The 'Most Read' articles within the news piece relate to Manhattan traffic, Trump's policies, housing aid, and reading scores, none of which directly affect Apple. Similarly, the Businessweek headlines discuss skiing, Trump's backers, Tesla sales, Buc-ee's gas stations, and fertility treatments - all irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock performance. The RBA comments are focused on domestic Australian financial system risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates strong iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence, suggesting a positive correlation between the software and product demand.  This is a bullish signal, implying increased consumer interest and potentially higher revenue for Apple.  However, the news is specific to certain markets and doesn't provide overall sales figures or address other potential factors that could impact stock price, such as macroeconomic conditions or competition.  Therefore, while the news is generally positive, the impact on the stock price is not guaranteed to be significant or solely positive. A rise is more likely than a fall, but there's still a possibility of a price decrease due to other market factors or investor sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong market penetration and potential for further growth by cross-selling other Apple products like Mac, iPad, or Watch. Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. The probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact the stock price. The article also mentions that several other tech and financial companies are releasing their quarterly earnings results, which could contribute to overall market sentiment. However, there is no specific information in the headline or article that would strongly suggest a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are based on the general expectation that earnings reports can lead to stock price movements, but the direction is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is looking to emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, to compensate for flagging performance in China. This diversification strategy could lead to increased revenue and growth opportunities, potentially positively impacting the stock price. However, the news does not provide any concrete numbers or guarantees of success, and the challenges of expanding into new markets should not be underestimated. Given this, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are not extremely high due to the uncertainties involved.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
