      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\nNews Content: Apple is a mature company, and it revealed in its first-quarter earnings call that its installed base of devices had reached over 2.35 billion. The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices. The numbers suggest that Apple could still have room to grow its base by convincing iPhone owners to buy a Mac, iPad, or Watch.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a bullish outlook for the stock market in 2025, particularly for large-cap companies like Apple Inc. Given its favorable ranking among stocks for beginners and its robust growth potential in AI services, there is a strong likelihood of price appreciation despite recent struggles in the Chinese market. The overall market forecast from Tom Lee supports a positive sentiment for AAPL. However, potential risks such as government efficiency initiatives and tariffs may impact sentiment. Balancing these factors, it's estimated that the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increasing its scrutiny of Australian pension fund liquidity risks. While this doesn't directly impact Apple's operations, the analysis suggests potential indirect effects. A significant financial shock in Australia, a key market for Apple, could negatively influence consumer spending and investment. Heightened scrutiny and regulatory adjustments could indirectly impact market sentiment. However, Apple is a global company with diversified revenue streams. Therefore, while a major Australian financial crisis could have *some* impact, it's unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in Apple's stock price. The 'Most Read' articles within the news piece relate to Manhattan traffic, Trump's policies, housing aid, and reading scores, none of which directly affect Apple. Similarly, the Businessweek headlines discuss skiing, Trump's backers, Tesla sales, Buc-ee's gas stations, and fertility treatments - all irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock performance. The RBA comments are focused on domestic Australian financial system risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates strong iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence, suggesting a positive correlation between the software and product demand.  This is a bullish signal, implying increased consumer interest and potentially higher revenue for Apple.  However, the news is specific to certain markets and doesn't provide overall sales figures or address other potential factors that could impact stock price, such as macroeconomic conditions or competition.  Therefore, while the news is generally positive, the impact on the stock price is not guaranteed to be significant or solely positive. A rise is more likely than a fall, but there's still a possibility of a price decrease due to other market factors or investor sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong market penetration and potential for further growth by cross-selling other Apple products like Mac, iPad, or Watch. Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. The probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact the stock price. The article also mentions that several other tech and financial companies are releasing their quarterly earnings results, which could contribute to overall market sentiment. However, there is no specific information in the headline or article that would strongly suggest a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are based on the general expectation that earnings reports can lead to stock price movements, but the direction is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is looking to emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, to compensate for flagging performance in China. This diversification strategy could lead to increased revenue and growth opportunities, potentially positively impacting the stock price. However, the news does not provide any concrete numbers or guarantees of success, and the challenges of expanding into new markets should not be underestimated. Given this, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are not extremely high due to the uncertainties involved.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a generally optimistic outlook for Apple and the overall market through 2025, driven by expected growth in earnings and the potential for expanding revenue from AI services and a large installed device base. Despite challenges in the Chinese market, the forecasted growth rate of 6% and Apple's position as a top choice for beginner investors strengthens the bullish sentiment. However, risks such as possible government efficiency measures and tariffs could dampen prospects. Overall, the probabilities reflect a stronger belief in AAPL's upward potential, aligning with the predictions of other analyses that favor a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increasing its scrutiny of Australian pension fund liquidity risks. This has an indirect impact on Apple. A significant financial shock in Australia, a key market for Apple, could negatively influence consumer spending and investment. Heightened scrutiny and regulatory adjustments could indirectly impact market sentiment. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams mitigate the risk. Reviewing the previous rounds' predictions, there's broad disagreement on the likely price movement. Some models focus on Apple-specific factors making bullish predictions, while others highlight potentially negative economic factors making relatively bearish predictions. The current article focuses on macroeconomic risks in Australia. Given that there is a risk in Australia that may impact consumer spending and investment, I lean towards a slight downturn, although not a very significant one. Also note that the previous rounds' predictions overall tend to be positive about the stock, so I discount my negative estimation appropriately.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is positive, indicating strong iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence. This suggests a positive correlation between the new software and product demand, a bullish signal. However, the news is limited in scope, focusing only on specific markets and not providing overall sales figures.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some emphasizing the positive correlation between AI software and sales, while others highlight potential risks in various markets and macroeconomic conditions.  The strongest positive predictions were 0.7, and the strongest negative 0.65, implying the overall sentiment is still moderately positive but with significant uncertainties. Considering the positive news coupled with the range of previous predictions, a moderate probability increase is predicted. However, the lack of comprehensive data prevents a vastly bullish prediction. Therefore, a probability of rise slightly higher than the average of the predictions is most appropriate, accounting for the positive news but also acknowledging inherent uncertainties.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers.

Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. The probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a rise probability between 0.55 and 0.7. The consensus suggests a bullish outlook, albeit with some caution due to the company's maturity and potential market uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report along with other market events such as Q4 GDP data and home sales. While the news does not directly provide Apple's earnings results, it sets a context of significant market events that could impact Apple's stock price. Historically, earnings reports can lead to substantial stock price movements. Given that Apple is a major tech company with a strong presence in the market, positive earnings could lead to a stock price increase, while negative results could lead to a decrease. However, without specific details on Apple's performance, we rely on general market sentiment and the importance of earnings reports. The mixed predictions from previous models suggest uncertainty, but overall, a slight bias towards a positive reaction is considered given Apple's market position and potential for growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is looking to emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, to compensate for flagging performance in China. This diversification strategy could lead to increased revenue and growth opportunities, potentially positively impacting the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, most models suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, with some variation in the estimated probabilities. However, the news does not provide any concrete numbers or guarantees of success, and the challenges of expanding into new markets should not be underestimated. Given this, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term. The previous predictions from various models show varying degrees of bullish and bearish sentiments, but the declining revenue in Greater China and the current Zacks rank seem to outweigh the positive earnings surprises.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a generally optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its ranking as a top stock for beginners and highlighting a potential growth in earnings driven by AI services and a strong installed base of devices. While there are challenges in China and macroeconomic risks, the overall sentiment is positive, especially with a projected growth rate of 6% for 2025. Predictors lean towards bullish predictions based on Apple's strong market position and product demand, despite acknowledging certain risks. Consequently, the probabilities show a higher likelihood of price appreciation, influenced by the broader positive market outlook for mega-cap stocks and ongoing innovations from Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's increasing scrutiny of pension fund liquidity risks. This is unlikely to have a direct immediate impact on Apple's stock price, although Australia is a market for Apple. However, a broader financial crisis triggered by the risks RBA is dealing with may have a negative influence on consumer spending and overall market sentiment, indirectly impacting Apple. Most previous rounds' predictions are related to different news headlines and contexts, with diverse outlooks. Given the indirect and mild nature of the risk arising from the RBA scrutiny and the generally positive sentiment shown by previous rounds' analysis, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than the rise, but not by much. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign a slightly higher probability to stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news is positive, showing stronger iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence. This suggests a positive correlation between the AI software and product demand, a bullish signal. However, the news is limited in scope, focusing only on specific markets and not providing overall sales figures.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty. Some models focus on the positive correlation between AI and sales, while others highlight potential risks in various markets and macroeconomic conditions.  The range of previous predictions (0.3 to 0.7 for probability of rise) indicates significant uncertainty.  Considering the positive news and the range of previous predictions, a moderate probability of a rise is predicted, acknowledging the lack of comprehensive data and the mixed signals from previous analyses. I'm weighting the positive news more heavily given that it is directly related to Apple's product performance, but I am acknowledging the uncertainty by not giving a high probability.  The overall sentiment from previous rounds leans slightly bullish, so I will not drastically deviate from that, but I remain cautiously optimistic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers.

Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a rise probability between 0.55 and 0.7. The consensus suggests a bullish outlook, albeit with some caution due to the company's maturity and potential market uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The provided news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report along with other market events such as Q4 GDP data and home sales.

(AAPL), highlighting its status as a top stock for beginners and potential growth driven by innovative AI services. Despite challenges in the Chinese market, the overall sentiment is positive, aided by a projected 6% growth rate for 2025. Historical data and analysts' predictions suggest strong revenue capabilities and market demand for AAPL products, particularly with a vast installed device base that supports additional growth through services. Although there are risks such as possible government initiatives and tariffs, the bullish sentiment from multiple analyses strengthens the case for a rise in stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price rising versus falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news focuses on the RBA's increased scrutiny of Australian pension fund liquidity risks. This event is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock. However, an Australian financial crisis triggered by these risks could negatively influence consumer spending and overall market sentiment, impacting Apple indirectly. The previous rounds show mixed sentiment, with the majority leaning towards a positive outlook based on different news. Considering the indirect and mild nature of the news impact, offset by majority positive sentiment from prior rounds, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly nudged.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is positive, highlighting stronger iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence. This suggests a positive correlation between the AI software and product demand, a bullish signal. However, the news is limited in scope, focusing only on specific markets and not providing overall sales figures.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting significant uncertainty. The range of previous probabilities of a price rise is wide (0.3 to 0.7).  Considering the positive news and the range of previous predictions, I'm assigning a moderate probability of a price rise.  The lack of comprehensive data and mixed signals prevent a strongly bullish or bearish prediction.  The overall sentiment across multiple models and rounds shows a slight bias towards a positive outlook which I am taking into account.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong market penetration and potential for further growth by cross-selling other Apple products like Mac, iPad, or Watch. Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic.

The consensus suggests a bullish outlook, albeit with some caution due to the company's maturity and potential market uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'As China Flags, Apple Looks to Emerging Markets' suggests that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams by focusing on emerging markets, particularly in India and the Middle East, to compensate for the decline in sales in China. This strategy could lead to increased revenue and growth opportunities, potentially positively impacting the stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, most of which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, and taking into account the potential for growth in emerging markets, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the challenges of expanding into new markets and the lack of concrete numbers or guarantees of success should not be underestimated, which is why I will not assign a very high probability to the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth.
