      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\nNews Content: Apple is a mature company, and it revealed in its first-quarter earnings call that its installed base of devices had reached over 2.35 billion. The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices. The numbers suggest that Apple could still have room to grow its base by convincing iPhone owners to buy a Mac, iPad, or Watch.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's revelation of a growing installed base of over 2.35 billion devices indicates continued customer acquisition, suggesting potential growth opportunities for sales across its product lines. This is a positive sign for investors, likely leading to an increase in stock price. While market volatility exists, the overall sentiment should lean towards a rise in stock price due to the optimistic growth outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's strategic shift towards emerging markets, specifically India and the Middle East, to offset challenges in China. This suggests proactive management and potential growth opportunities in new markets. While challenges in China are a concern, the focus on emerging markets signals a potential for future revenue streams and could be viewed positively by investors. However, the success of these efforts is not guaranteed, and depends on execution and competition in those regions. The market reaction will likely depend on the market's larger view on Apple's global diversification and the growth prospects in these emerging markets. Based on the tone and the topic, the market is likely to view this information positively, though not significantly. I'd predict market optimism is slightly higher than pessimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights a potential slowdown in iPhone sales based on a historical three-year refresh cycle.  However, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, downplayed this concern, attributing past high sales to the COVID-19 period and emphasizing future opportunities.  This suggests a degree of uncertainty. While the missing refresh cycle could negatively impact short-term sales figures, Cook's optimistic outlook and the continued focus on new product opportunities mitigate the potential for a significant negative market reaction.  The overall market sentiment towards Apple and its long-term prospects remains largely positive. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the uncertainty warrants probabilities closer to even.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report along with other key market events like Q4 GDP data and home sales. Apple's stock price movement will likely be influenced by its earnings results, which are a significant driver of investor sentiment. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have led to notable stock price movements, depending on whether they meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. The broader economic data (GDP and home sales) may have a secondary impact, but the primary focus will be on Apple's earnings. Given the uncertainty surrounding earnings outcomes, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive reaction due to Apple's strong track record and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's iPhone sales may be experiencing a downturn or irregularity in their typical refresh cycle. The CEO's response focuses on future opportunities rather than addressing the current cycle's impact. This could lead to investor concerns about the company's short-term performance, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, the emphasis on future opportunities and the historical context of Apple's product cycles might mitigate severe declines or even lead to a rise if investors interpret the news as an expected fluctuation. Given the neutral to slightly negative tone, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has made a positive statement about DeepSeek, an AI model from China. Since Tim Cook's statement is neutral and does not explicitly state that Apple will be collaborating or directly benefiting from DeepSeek, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, the fact that the CEO is open to innovation and views efficiency-driven technology positively may be perceived as a mildly positive sentiment. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are close to being equal due to the lack of concrete information about the potential impact of DeepSeek on Apple's business.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
