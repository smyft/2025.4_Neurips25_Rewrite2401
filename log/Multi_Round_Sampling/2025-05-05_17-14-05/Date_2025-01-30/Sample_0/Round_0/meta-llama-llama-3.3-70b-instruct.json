Since Tim Cook's statement is neutral and does not explicitly state that Apple will be collaborating or directly benefiting from DeepSeek, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, the fact that the CEO is open to innovation and views efficiency-driven technology positively may be perceived as a mildly positive sentiment. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are close to being equal due to the lack of concrete information about the potential impact of DeepSeek on Apple's business.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
