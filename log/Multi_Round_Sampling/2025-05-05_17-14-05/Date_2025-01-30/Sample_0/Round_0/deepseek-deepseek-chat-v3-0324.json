Apple's stock price movement will likely be influenced by its earnings results, which are a significant driver of investor sentiment. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have led to notable stock price movements, depending on whether they meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. The broader economic data (GDP and home sales) may have a secondary impact, but the primary focus will be on Apple's earnings. Given the uncertainty surrounding earnings outcomes, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive reaction due to Apple's strong track record and market position.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple earnings, Q4 GDP data, home sales: What to Watch\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
