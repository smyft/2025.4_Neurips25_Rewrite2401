      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The decrease in iPhone sales, which is a key revenue driver for Apple, indicates potential challenges in meeting investor expectations. Although total revenue increased, the miss on iPhone sales suggests that growth may not be as robust as anticipated, particularly with the focus on AI advancements not translating into immediate sales growth. Therefore, the negative sentiment surrounding the iPhone sales figures may lead to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Wall Street analysts predict only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales, a key driver of Apple's revenue (representing half of total revenue in fiscal 2024). This low growth projection, following a period of similar low growth in fiscal years 2022-2024, suggests a potential for disappointment if the actual results fall short of expectations or even slightly meet the low forecast.  Investors may react negatively to underwhelming iPhone sales figures, potentially leading to a stock price decline. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and overall strong financial position could mitigate this negative impact to some degree.  Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, though the impact is likely to be moderate, not extreme.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, which is generally a positive signal for the stock. However, the article also mentions that the estimate revisions trend for Apple is unfavorable, translating to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance in the near future. Additionally, the stock has already underperformed the market year-to-date, and the industry rank is in the bottom 28%, which could weigh on the stock. The immediate price movement may also depend on management's commentary during the earnings call. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a rise is tempered by the unfavorable earnings outlook and industry performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report along with other market events such as Q4 GDP data and home sales. Generally, earnings reports can cause stock price volatility. If Apple's earnings beat expectations, the stock price is likely to rise. However, if the earnings miss expectations or if the overall market sentiment turns negative due to GDP or home sales data, the stock price could fall. Given that the article does not provide specific details about Apple's earnings expectations, we must consider the general impact of earnings announcements and economic data. Historically, tech stocks like Apple can experience a positive reaction if earnings are strong, but economic data like GDP and home sales can influence the broader market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) increased scrutiny on the liquidity risks associated with the nation's pension fund industry. However, this news does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), a technology company. The article focuses on the Australian economy and financial system, with no mention of Apple or its operations. Therefore, it is unlikely that this news will have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strong investment by Warren Buffett in AI-related stocks, implying that Apple, with its focus on AI and technology, could be one of these leading stocks. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple as an AI-driven company, potentially driving investment. However, the news doesn't specifically mention Berkshire's investment in Apple, which limits direct impact on Apple's stock. Thus, we need to consider if this news reflects positively or not on the broader perception of Apple\u2019s position in AI.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
