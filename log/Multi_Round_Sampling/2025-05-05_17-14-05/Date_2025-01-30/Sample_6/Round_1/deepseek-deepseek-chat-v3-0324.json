(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The decrease in iPhone sales, which is a key revenue driver for Apple, indicates potential challenges in meeting investor expectations. Although total revenue increased, the miss on iPhone sales suggests that growth may not be as robust as anticipated, particularly with the focus on AI advancements not translating into immediate sales growth. Therefore, the negative sentiment surrounding the iPhone sales figures may lead to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Wall Street analysts predict only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales, a key driver of Apple's revenue (representing half of total revenue in fiscal 2024). This low growth projection, following a period of similar low growth in fiscal years 2022-2024, suggests a potential for disappointment if the actual results fall short of expectations or even slightly meet the low forecast.  Investors may react negatively to underwhelming iPhone sales figures, potentially leading to a stock price decline. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and overall strong financial position could mitigate this negative impact to some degree.  Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, though the impact is likely to be moderate, not extreme.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, which is generally a positive signal for the stock. However, the article also mentions that the estimate revisions trend for Apple is unfavorable, translating to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance in the near future. Additionally, the stock has already underperformed the market year-to-date, and the industry rank is in the bottom 28%, which could weigh on the stock. The immediate price movement may also depend on management's commentary during the earnings call. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a rise is tempered by the unfavorable earnings outlook and industry performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report along with other market events such as Q4 GDP data and home sales. Generally, earnings reports can cause stock price volatility. If Apple's earnings beat expectations, the stock price is likely to rise. However, if the earnings miss expectations or if the overall market sentiment turns negative due to GDP or home sales data, the stock price could fall. Given that the article does not provide specific details about Apple's earnings expectations, we must consider the general impact of earnings announcements and economic data. Historically, tech stocks like Apple can experience a positive reaction if earnings are strong, but economic data like GDP and home sales can influence the broader market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) increased scrutiny on the liquidity risks associated with the nation's pension fund industry. However, this news does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), a technology company. The article focuses on the Australian economy and financial system, with no mention of Apple or its operations. Therefore, it is unlikely that this news will have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strong investment by Warren Buffett in AI-related stocks, implying that Apple, with its focus on AI and technology, could be one of these leading stocks. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple as an AI-driven company, potentially driving investment. However, the news doesn't specifically mention Berkshire's investment in Apple, which limits direct impact on Apple's stock. Thus, we need to consider if this news reflects positively or not on the broader perception of Apple\u2019s position in AI.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
