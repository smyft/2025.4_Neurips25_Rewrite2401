(AAPL)\nNews Headline: RBA Ramps Up Scrutiny on Australian Pension Fund Liquidity Risks\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Australia\u2019s central bank is honing its focus on potential financial shocks linked to the nation\u2019s fast-growing A$4.1 trillion ($2.6 trillion) pensions industry, and working through multiple scenarios with regulators.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nSpeaking at a conference run by Conexus Financial on Thursday, Reserve Bank Assistant Governor Brad Jones said it would be a \u201cdereliction of our duty not to be engaging with the industry\u201d on liquidity risks. He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
