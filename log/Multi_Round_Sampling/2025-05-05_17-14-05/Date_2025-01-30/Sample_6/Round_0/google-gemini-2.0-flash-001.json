(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\nNews Content: Apple is a mature company, and it revealed in its first-quarter earnings call that its installed base of devices had reached over 2.35 billion. The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices. The numbers suggest that Apple could still have room to grow its base by convincing iPhone owners to buy a Mac, iPad, or Watch.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
