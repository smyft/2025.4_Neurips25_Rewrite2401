      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\nNews Content: When Apple reports its fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, the stakes are particularly high. 1. At half of total revenue in fiscal 2024, iPhone sales are always paramount in Apple\u2019s financials. Wall Street analysts see only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales from a year before, so it may mean another year of low iPhone growth, like in fiscal 2022 through 2024.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips could negatively impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it suggests potential supply chain issues or challenges ahead for tech companies relying on these semiconductors. As Apple is a major customer of STMicroelectronics, a decline in chip sales may lead to concerns about their production capabilities and product availability. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is increased, while the likelihood of a rise seems less probable given the context of the report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the company beat earnings estimates and matched sales expectations (indicating financial strength and effective management), the decline in iPhone sales is a concern, potentially signaling weakening demand for their flagship product. However, the positive earnings report and the increase in the stock price during extended trading suggest an initial positive market reaction, likely driven by the earnings beat and the growth in services. Considering this and recent trends. The positive aspects outweigh the negative in the immediate term, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings showed a slight beat on both revenue and EPS compared to analyst estimates. However, a closer look at the geographic and product-line revenue reveals a mixed picture. While some segments like Europe and Japan showed strong growth, Greater China experienced a significant decline.  The iPhone, Apple's flagship product, saw a slight year-over-year decrease in revenue, despite meeting analysts' estimates.  Other segments like Wearables, Home, and Accessories missed expectations.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests near-term underperformance. Although the earnings beat is positive, the mixed performance across segments and the negative Zacks ranking suggest that the market's reaction might be muted or even negative. Considering the mixed results and negative Zacks ranking, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be higher than the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant portion of its portfolio invested in two leading AI stocks, one of which is likely Apple Inc. (AAPL). This indicates strong confidence from a highly respected investor, which could positively influence market sentiment. Additionally, Apple's involvement in the AI revolution may attract more investor interest, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's AI initiatives or financial performance, so the impact may be moderate. The probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall due to the positive sentiment and Buffett's endorsement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway having a significant portion of its portfolio invested in two leading AI stocks, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, given Apple's significant involvement in AI through projects like Siri, Apple Intelligence, and its strategic acquisitions, it's plausible that Apple could be one of the AI stocks referenced. If investors perceive Apple as a key player in the AI space, this news could positively influence its stock price. Nonetheless, the lack of direct mention introduces uncertainty, which could temper the stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Wall Street analysts expect only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales, which is a significant contributor to Apple's revenue. This low growth expectation may negatively impact the stock price. However, Apple's overall financial health, diversification of products, and potential upside from other segments like services could mitigate the impact. Considering the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the earnings report, but still a significant probability of the stock price rising if other factors like earnings surprises or positive guidance are announced.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector as a whole, including Apple's earnings, Microsoft and Meta's defensiveness on AI spending, Tesla's efforts to slash costs and introduce cheaper EV models, and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. For Apple, the news indicates tepid quarterly revenue growth due to increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to AI-enhanced features. Although Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers, the tepid growth expectation may weigh on investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
