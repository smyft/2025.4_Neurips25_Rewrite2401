(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Compared to Estimates, Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: A Look at Key Metrics\nNews Content: For the quarter ended December 2024, Apple (AAPL) reported revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% over the same period last year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips could negatively impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it suggests potential supply chain issues or challenges ahead for tech companies relying on these semiconductors. As Apple is a major customer of STMicroelectronics, a decline in chip sales may lead to concerns about their production capabilities and product availability. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is increased, while the likelihood of a rise seems less probable given the context of the report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the company beat earnings estimates and matched sales expectations (indicating financial strength and effective management), the decline in iPhone sales is a concern, potentially signaling weakening demand for their flagship product. However, the positive earnings report and the increase in the stock price during extended trading suggest an initial positive market reaction, likely driven by the earnings beat and the growth in services. Considering this and recent trends. The positive aspects outweigh the negative in the immediate term, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings showed a slight beat on both revenue and EPS compared to analyst estimates. However, a closer look at the geographic and product-line revenue reveals a mixed picture. While some segments like Europe and Japan showed strong growth, Greater China experienced a significant decline.  The iPhone, Apple's flagship product, saw a slight year-over-year decrease in revenue, despite meeting analysts' estimates.  Other segments like Wearables, Home, and Accessories missed expectations.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests near-term underperformance. Although the earnings beat is positive, the mixed performance across segments and the negative Zacks ranking suggest that the market's reaction might be muted or even negative. Considering the mixed results and negative Zacks ranking, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be higher than the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant portion of its portfolio invested in two leading AI stocks, one of which is likely Apple Inc. (AAPL). This indicates strong confidence from a highly respected investor, which could positively influence market sentiment. Additionally, Apple's involvement in the AI revolution may attract more investor interest, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's AI initiatives or financial performance, so the impact may be moderate. The probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall due to the positive sentiment and Buffett's endorsement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway having a significant portion of its portfolio invested in two leading AI stocks, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, given Apple's significant involvement in AI through projects like Siri, Apple Intelligence, and its strategic acquisitions, it's plausible that Apple could be one of the AI stocks referenced. If investors perceive Apple as a key player in the AI space, this news could positively influence its stock price. Nonetheless, the lack of direct mention introduces uncertainty, which could temper the stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Wall Street analysts expect only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales, which is a significant contributor to Apple's revenue. This low growth expectation may negatively impact the stock price. However, Apple's overall financial health, diversification of products, and potential upside from other segments like services could mitigate the impact. Considering the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the earnings report, but still a significant probability of the stock price rising if other factors like earnings surprises or positive guidance are announced.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector as a whole, including Apple's earnings, Microsoft and Meta's defensiveness on AI spending, Tesla's efforts to slash costs and introduce cheaper EV models, and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. For Apple, the news indicates tepid quarterly revenue growth due to increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to AI-enhanced features. Although Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers, the tepid growth expectation may weigh on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Beating earnings targets is positive, and the after-hours stock increase suggests initial market optimism. However, declining iPhone sales are concerning, potentially indicating weakening demand for their flagship product. The overall sentiment from earlier rounds is mixed, with predictions ranging from a higher probability of rise to a higher probability of fall. Given that the after-hours trading saw a rise, the probability of continued upward momentum in the short term is slightly elevated. However, the known iPhone decline caps the potential, therefore considering earlier predictions and their possible hidden information, along with the current information, the probability of fall is slightly higher due to concerns about the long-term implications and potential future downgrades.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings report shows a mixed bag. While it beat EPS and revenue expectations slightly, a deeper dive reveals concerns.  The significant decline in Greater China revenue (-11.1% YoY) is a major negative.  Although other geographic regions showed growth, the overall picture is less robust than initially perceived. iPhone revenue was essentially flat YoY, a key point of concern given its significance to Apple's overall revenue.  The Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment also missed expectations. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further adds to the bearish sentiment. While the Services segment performed well (+13.9% YoY) and some product lines like Mac and iPad showed strong growth, the weakness in other key areas, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, outweighs these positives. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions. However, considering the mixed performance across segments, the negative Zacks rating, and the significant downturn in the Chinese market, the probability of a price fall appears higher than a rise in the immediate term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, with Apple likely being one of them, given its strong presence in the AI space through projects like Siri and Apple Intelligence. This endorsement from a respected investor like Buffett could positively influence market sentiment and attract more investor interest. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's AI initiatives or financial performance, which introduces some uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions\u2014where some models emphasized positive sentiment from Buffett's investment while others pointed to tepid growth expectations and competition\u2014I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to the positive sentiment, but with a significant probability of the stock price falling if the market focuses on broader challenges like competition and growth concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway having a significant portion of its portfolio invested in two leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks. Although Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned, given its significant involvement in AI through projects like Siri, Apple Intelligence, and strategic acquisitions, it's plausible that Apple could be one of the AI stocks referenced. This association with AI and the endorsement from a highly respected investor like Warren Buffett could positively influence Apple's stock price. However, the lack of direct mention introduces uncertainty, which could temper the stock price movement. Considering the positive sentiment and potential AI involvement, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple's upcoming earnings report highlights the importance of iPhone sales, which are expected to show only a 1.4% annual increase. This low growth expectation could negatively impact the stock price. However, considering the trend of others' predictions and the mixed signals from the news, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. Additionally, the predictions from other models indicate a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise due to positive factors such as Warren Buffett's investment and Apple's involvement in AI, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to low iPhone growth expectations and mixed financial performance. Taking into account the mixed signals and the range of opinions, I estimate the probabilities as follows.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector as a whole, including Apple's earnings, Microsoft and Meta's defensiveness on AI spending, Tesla's efforts to slash costs and introduce cheaper EV models, and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. For Apple specifically, the news highlights tepid quarterly revenue growth due to increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to AI-enhanced features. Although Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers, tepid growth expectations may weigh on investor sentiment, while positive sentiments from some positive earnings news and past forecasts may support a slightly more optimistic view.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
