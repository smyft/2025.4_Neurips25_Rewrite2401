A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, suggesting a conservative approach in contrast to increasing investments seen in other tech companies like Meta. While Apple is still a leader in many areas, being perceived as lagging in AI may invoke concerns about its competitive positioning. However, the mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach may provide some support for investor confidence. Overall, the impact could be negative due to fear of falling behind in the AI race, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a slightly positive sentiment. Tim Cook acknowledging DeepSeek as a 'good thing' indicates Apple is open to and acknowledges innovation in the AI space, even outside of its own developments. This could be interpreted positively by investors as it suggests Apple is aware of the competitive landscape and potentially open to collaboration or integration of advanced technologies. However, the statement is relatively general and doesn't involve any concrete partnerships or product implications. Therefore, the impact should be subtle and unlikely to cause a major price swing. It is more likely that the effect on the stock is net positive, though relatively moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race, others may interpret it as a sign of fiscal responsibility and a focus on profitability rather than excessive investment in a still-developing field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could further support this positive interpretation.  However, the substantial AI investments by competitors, especially Meta's announced $60-$65 billion CAPEX increase, could put pressure on Apple's stock if investors perceive a widening competitive gap in the AI space.  The overall impact is uncertain, and the market reaction will depend on whether the market prioritizes Apple's conservative approach or views the lower AI expenditure as a competitive disadvantage.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. Since Apple is one of its customers, this could imply potential supply chain issues or reduced component availability for Apple products, which might negatively impact Apple's production or costs. However, the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited if the company has diversified suppliers or if the demand for its products remains strong. Given the mixed implications, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. Despite some geographic and product segment revenues beating estimates, others like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories missed expectations. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Considering the mixed results and the current sell rating, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the stock. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend suggest that the stock may underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, Apple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the Q1 quarter, showing strong financial performance. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests that near-term expectations are not favorable, and the shares might underperform the market. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the broader market since the beginning of the year, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
