(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, suggesting a conservative approach in contrast to increasing investments seen in other tech companies like Meta. While Apple is still a leader in many areas, being perceived as lagging in AI may invoke concerns about its competitive positioning. However, the mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach may provide some support for investor confidence. Overall, the impact could be negative due to fear of falling behind in the AI race, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a slightly positive sentiment. Tim Cook acknowledging DeepSeek as a 'good thing' indicates Apple is open to and acknowledges innovation in the AI space, even outside of its own developments. This could be interpreted positively by investors as it suggests Apple is aware of the competitive landscape and potentially open to collaboration or integration of advanced technologies. However, the statement is relatively general and doesn't involve any concrete partnerships or product implications. Therefore, the impact should be subtle and unlikely to cause a major price swing. It is more likely that the effect on the stock is net positive, though relatively moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race, others may interpret it as a sign of fiscal responsibility and a focus on profitability rather than excessive investment in a still-developing field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could further support this positive interpretation.  However, the substantial AI investments by competitors, especially Meta's announced $60-$65 billion CAPEX increase, could put pressure on Apple's stock if investors perceive a widening competitive gap in the AI space.  The overall impact is uncertain, and the market reaction will depend on whether the market prioritizes Apple's conservative approach or views the lower AI expenditure as a competitive disadvantage.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. Since Apple is one of its customers, this could imply potential supply chain issues or reduced component availability for Apple products, which might negatively impact Apple's production or costs. However, the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited if the company has diversified suppliers or if the demand for its products remains strong. Given the mixed implications, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. Despite some geographic and product segment revenues beating estimates, others like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories missed expectations. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Considering the mixed results and the current sell rating, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the stock. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend suggest that the stock may underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, Apple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the Q1 quarter, showing strong financial performance. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests that near-term expectations are not favorable, and the shares might underperform the market. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the broader market since the beginning of the year, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
