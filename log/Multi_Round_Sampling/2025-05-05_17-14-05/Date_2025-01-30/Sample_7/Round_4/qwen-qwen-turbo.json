(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, suggesting a conservative approach in contrast to increasing investments seen in other tech companies like Meta. While Apple is still a leader in many areas, being perceived as lagging in AI may invoke concerns about its competitive positioning. However, the mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach may provide some support for investor confidence. Overall, the impact could be negative due to fear of falling behind in the AI race, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a slightly positive sentiment. Tim Cook acknowledging DeepSeek as a 'good thing' indicates Apple is open to and acknowledges innovation in the AI space, even outside of its own developments. This could be interpreted positively by investors as it suggests Apple is aware of the competitive landscape and potentially open to collaboration or integration of advanced technologies. However, the statement is relatively general and doesn't involve any concrete partnerships or product implications. Therefore, the impact should be subtle and unlikely to cause a major price swing. It is more likely that the effect on the stock is net positive, though relatively moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race, others may interpret it as a sign of fiscal responsibility and a focus on profitability rather than excessive investment in a still-developing field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could further support this positive interpretation.  However, the substantial AI investments by competitors, especially Meta's announced $60-$65 billion CAPEX increase, could put pressure on Apple's stock if investors perceive a widening competitive gap in the AI space.  The overall impact is uncertain, and the market reaction will depend on whether the market prioritizes Apple's conservative approach or views the lower AI expenditure as a competitive disadvantage.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. Since Apple is one of its customers, this could imply potential supply chain issues or reduced component availability for Apple products, which might negatively impact Apple's production or costs. However, the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited if the company has diversified suppliers or if the demand for its products remains strong. Given the mixed implications, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. Despite some geographic and product segment revenues beating estimates, others like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories missed expectations. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Considering the mixed results and the current sell rating, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the stock. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend suggest that the stock may underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, Apple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the Q1 quarter, showing strong financial performance. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests that near-term expectations are not favorable, and the shares might underperform the market. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the broader market since the beginning of the year, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's spending on AI remains muted compared to peers like Meta, which suggests a more conservative approach. While DeepSeek validates Apple's strategy, investors might perceive the company's lower investment as a potential competitive disadvantage. Given the contrasting massive investments from competitors, this could lead to concerns about Apple's innovation and market positioning. Hence, the probability of the stock price falling is higher, though there are elements that could support slight upward movement due to fiscal responsibility and validation from DeepSeek.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is generally positive, indicating that Apple is aware of and acknowledges innovation in the AI space, specifically DeepSeek. This can be interpreted by investors as Apple staying current and being potentially open to future collaboration or integration of advanced technologies. However, it is a brief statement and does not imply concrete partnerships or product implications. Considering the previous model predictions, there's a mix of opinions, with some models suggesting concern over Apple's approach to AI while others see it as fiscally responsible. Given this context, market's short-term reaction isn't clear. Based on the new piece of news, I would slightly increase the probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging there's significant skepticism about Apple's long-term AI strategy within other AI model predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's comparatively low AI spending. While this could be seen negatively (lagging behind competitors), it could also be interpreted positively (fiscal responsibility, focusing on profitability).  The mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach further adds to the ambiguity. Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.55 probability of a price rise.  The mixed signals and the lack of concrete information make a strong prediction difficult.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the somewhat negative sentiment in several previous predictions (potentially influenced by other undisclosed factors), I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall. However, the probability is not significantly high given Apple's status and the potential for different interpretations of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This could imply potential supply chain issues or increased costs for Apple, which might negatively impact its production or margins. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong brand loyalty could mitigate some of these risks. Given the mixed implications and the previous predictions leaning towards a negative impact, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news reports Apple's Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. However, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Some geographic and product segment revenues beat estimates, while others like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories missed expectations. Considering the mixed results and the current sell rating, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the stock. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend suggest that the stock may underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, Apple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous predictions from other models also tend to agree on a higher probability of the stock price falling, with predictions ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for the probability of the stock price falling. Taking into account the mixed results, the current sell rating, and the industry performance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the Q1 quarter, which is generally a positive indication for the stock. The company's performance is better than anticipated, which typically leads to positive market reactions. However, the recent Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the unfavorable trend in estimate revisions suggest caution. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the market since the beginning of the year. The overall market sentiment, mixed results across different regions and segments, along with the current bearish rating, contribute to a cautious outlook. Despite the positive earnings surprise, these factors suggest a balanced outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple continues to spend less on AI compared to its peers, which may create a perception of falling behind in the competitive landscape. While DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could lend some investor confidence, the overall sentiment appears cautious due to substantial investments by competitors like Meta. Given these dynamics, there is an inclination towards a higher probability of stock price decline based on investor fears about competitiveness in AI, despite any potential signals of fiscal responsibility from Apple's conservative spending.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news itself is mildly positive. Cook acknowledging DeepSeek shows awareness of the AI landscape. However, it's a vague statement and doesn't indicate concrete actions. Previous rounds reveal a mixed sentiment, with some models concerned about Apple's AI approach and others highlighting fiscal responsibility. A significant factor is the context from previous rounds, including mentions of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which is a bearish signal, and revenue misses in some segments. Given the mixed signals and the negative downward pressure from previous predictions. the overall sentiment is still leaning towards a potential price decrease. There is also a forecast sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips by STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple. Therefore, balancing the mildly positive news against the broader negative sentiments, a slightly increased probability of stock price fall is predicted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's muted AI spending presents a mixed signal. While the lower spending compared to peers could be seen as fiscally responsible or a sign of focusing on proven technologies, it also risks portraying Apple as lagging in the rapidly developing AI field.  The validation from DeepSeek partially mitigates this concern, suggesting Apple's current approach may be viable. However, the significant AI investments by competitors like Meta create a potential competitive pressure.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the market's reaction.  Some models emphasize the positive aspects of Apple's earnings and revenue beating estimates, while others focus on the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), underperformance in certain segments, and the overall negative trend in the sector.  Considering the conflicting information and the lack of a clear consensus among previous predictive models, I assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable, leaning slightly towards a fall due to the competitive AI landscape.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This could imply potential supply chain issues or increased costs for Apple, which might negatively impact its production or margins. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong brand loyalty could mitigate some of these risks.

The previous predictions from other models also tend to agree on a higher probability of the stock price falling, with predictions ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for the probability of the stock price falling. Taking into account the mixed results, the current sell rating, and the industry performance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.6.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news reports Apple's Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. However, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Some geographic and product segment revenues beat estimates, while others like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories missed expectations. The mixed results, current sell rating, and industry performance suggest a cautious outlook. Additionally, concerns about Apple's approach to AI spending and its potential competitive disadvantage compared to peers may contribute to a negative perception. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the stock. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend suggest that the stock may underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, Apple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the Q1 quarter, which is generally a positive indication for the stock. The company's performance is better than anticipated, which typically leads to positive market reactions. However, the recent Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the unfavorable trend in estimate revisions suggest caution. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the market since the beginning of the year. The overall market sentiment, mixed results across different regions and segments, along with the current bearish rating, contribute to a cautious outlook. Despite the positive earnings surprise, these factors suggest a balanced outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's continued muted spending on AI compared to its peers raises concerns about its competitive positioning in the rapidly growing AI sector. While DeepSeek's validation of Apple's strategy could support investor confidence, the overall sentiment leans negative as competitors like Meta are making substantial investments. Coupled with the mixed performance in Q1 earnings and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), these factors contribute to a higher perceived risk of stock price decline. Thus, despite some positive aspects, the majority sentiment remains cautious, favoring a probability of falling stock prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline about Tim Cook's positive comment on DeepSeek is mildly positive, suggesting Apple acknowledges and is aware of advancements in AI, which could foster investor confidence in Apple's awareness of the competitive landscape. However, this positive sentiment is weak because it does not describe concrete actions, collaborations or innovations. Furthermore, the previous rounds indicate mixed sentiments and a general lean towards a potentially negative view of the stock in the short term, noting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), underperformance relative to the market, reduced demands from supplies, and some previous underperformance in Greater China and Wearables. Considering the mildly positive news against the larger context of existing market concerns and previous model predictions which tend towards a somewhat more negative outlook, the probability of the stock price increasing is only slightly higher than the probability of it decreasing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's muted AI spending presents a mixed picture. While the lower spending compared to competitors could be viewed positively as fiscally responsible, it also risks making Apple appear less innovative in the rapidly developing AI field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's strategy offers some support, but the significant AI investments by competitors, particularly Meta, introduce considerable competitive pressure.  The previous predictions show a notable divergence of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding market reaction.  Several models cite the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, underperformance in certain segments, and negative industry trends as bearish indicators, outweighing the positive impact of exceeding Q1 earnings and revenue estimates.  The mixed signals from the news itself, combined with the prevailing negative sentiment from other models and the potential for supply chain issues (STMicroelectronics forecast), suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price fall. However, the probability is not overwhelmingly high given Apple's strong brand and generally robust performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This could imply potential supply chain issues or increased costs for Apple, which might negatively impact its production or margins. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong brand loyalty could mitigate some of these risks.

The previous predictions from other models also tend to agree on a higher probability of the stock price falling, with predictions ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for the probability of the stock price falling. Taking into account the mixed results, the current sell rating, and the industry performance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.6.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.
