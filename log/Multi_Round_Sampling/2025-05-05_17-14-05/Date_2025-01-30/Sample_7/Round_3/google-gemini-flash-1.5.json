      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue. DeepSeek Validates the Approach.\nNews Content: Apple continues to spend less than its Magnificent 7 peers on artificial intelligence. American tech companies have spent billions of dollars on developing generative artificial intelligence projects, with plans to spend much more. Facebook parent Meta Platforms said last week that Meta is planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year while significantly increasing the size of the company\u2019s AI teams.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, suggesting a conservative approach in contrast to increasing investments seen in other tech companies like Meta. While Apple is still a leader in many areas, being perceived as lagging in AI may invoke concerns about its competitive positioning. However, the mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach may provide some support for investor confidence. Overall, the impact could be negative due to fear of falling behind in the AI race, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a slightly positive sentiment. Tim Cook acknowledging DeepSeek as a 'good thing' indicates Apple is open to and acknowledges innovation in the AI space, even outside of its own developments. This could be interpreted positively by investors as it suggests Apple is aware of the competitive landscape and potentially open to collaboration or integration of advanced technologies. However, the statement is relatively general and doesn't involve any concrete partnerships or product implications. Therefore, the impact should be subtle and unlikely to cause a major price swing. It is more likely that the effect on the stock is net positive, though relatively moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race, others may interpret it as a sign of fiscal responsibility and a focus on profitability rather than excessive investment in a still-developing field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could further support this positive interpretation.  However, the substantial AI investments by competitors, especially Meta's announced $60-$65 billion CAPEX increase, could put pressure on Apple's stock if investors perceive a widening competitive gap in the AI space.  The overall impact is uncertain, and the market reaction will depend on whether the market prioritizes Apple's conservative approach or views the lower AI expenditure as a competitive disadvantage.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. Since Apple is one of its customers, this could imply potential supply chain issues or reduced component availability for Apple products, which might negatively impact Apple's production or costs. However, the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited if the company has diversified suppliers or if the demand for its products remains strong. Given the mixed implications, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. Despite some geographic and product segment revenues beating estimates, others like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories missed expectations. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Considering the mixed results and the current sell rating, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the stock. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend suggest that the stock may underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, Apple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the Q1 quarter, showing strong financial performance. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests that near-term expectations are not favorable, and the shares might underperform the market. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the broader market since the beginning of the year, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's spending on AI remains muted compared to peers like Meta, which suggests a more conservative approach. While DeepSeek validates Apple's strategy, investors might perceive the company's lower investment as a potential competitive disadvantage. Given the contrasting massive investments from competitors, this could lead to concerns about Apple's innovation and market positioning. Hence, the probability of the stock price falling is higher, though there are elements that could support slight upward movement due to fiscal responsibility and validation from DeepSeek.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is generally positive, indicating that Apple is aware of and acknowledges innovation in the AI space, specifically DeepSeek. This can be interpreted by investors as Apple staying current and being potentially open to future collaboration or integration of advanced technologies. However, it is a brief statement and does not imply concrete partnerships or product implications. Considering the previous model predictions, there's a mix of opinions, with some models suggesting concern over Apple's approach to AI while others see it as fiscally responsible. Given this context, market's short-term reaction isn't clear. Based on the new piece of news, I would slightly increase the probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging there's significant skepticism about Apple's long-term AI strategy within other AI model predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's comparatively low AI spending. While this could be seen negatively (lagging behind competitors), it could also be interpreted positively (fiscal responsibility, focusing on profitability).  The mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach further adds to the ambiguity. Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.55 probability of a price rise.  The mixed signals and the lack of concrete information make a strong prediction difficult.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the somewhat negative sentiment in several previous predictions (potentially influenced by other undisclosed factors), I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall. However, the probability is not significantly high given Apple's status and the potential for different interpretations of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This could imply potential supply chain issues or increased costs for Apple, which might negatively impact its production or margins. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong brand loyalty could mitigate some of these risks. Given the mixed implications and the previous predictions leaning towards a negative impact, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news reports Apple's Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. However, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Some geographic and product segment revenues beat estimates, while others like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories missed expectations. Considering the mixed results and the current sell rating, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the stock. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend suggest that the stock may underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, Apple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous predictions from other models also tend to agree on a higher probability of the stock price falling, with predictions ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for the probability of the stock price falling. Taking into account the mixed results, the current sell rating, and the industry performance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the Q1 quarter, which is generally a positive indication for the stock. The company's performance is better than anticipated, which typically leads to positive market reactions. However, the recent Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the unfavorable trend in estimate revisions suggest caution. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the market since the beginning of the year. The overall market sentiment, mixed results across different regions and segments, along with the current bearish rating, contribute to a cautious outlook. Despite the positive earnings surprise, these factors suggest a balanced outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple continues to spend less on AI compared to its peers, which may create a perception of falling behind in the competitive landscape. While DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could lend some investor confidence, the overall sentiment appears cautious due to substantial investments by competitors like Meta. Given these dynamics, there is an inclination towards a higher probability of stock price decline based on investor fears about competitiveness in AI, despite any potential signals of fiscal responsibility from Apple's conservative spending.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news itself is mildly positive. Cook acknowledging DeepSeek shows awareness of the AI landscape. However, it's a vague statement and doesn't indicate concrete actions. Previous rounds reveal a mixed sentiment, with some models concerned about Apple's AI approach and others highlighting fiscal responsibility. A significant factor is the context from previous rounds, including mentions of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which is a bearish signal, and revenue misses in some segments. Given the mixed signals and the negative downward pressure from previous predictions. the overall sentiment is still leaning towards a potential price decrease. There is also a forecast sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips by STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple. Therefore, balancing the mildly positive news against the broader negative sentiments, a slightly increased probability of stock price fall is predicted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's muted AI spending presents a mixed signal. While the lower spending compared to peers could be seen as fiscally responsible or a sign of focusing on proven technologies, it also risks portraying Apple as lagging in the rapidly developing AI field.  The validation from DeepSeek partially mitigates this concern, suggesting Apple's current approach may be viable. However, the significant AI investments by competitors like Meta create a potential competitive pressure.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the market's reaction.  Some models emphasize the positive aspects of Apple's earnings and revenue beating estimates, while others focus on the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), underperformance in certain segments, and the overall negative trend in the sector.  Considering the conflicting information and the lack of a clear consensus among previous predictive models, I assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable, leaning slightly towards a fall due to the competitive AI landscape.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips.

However, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Some geographic and product segment revenues beat estimates, while others like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories missed expectations. The mixed results, current sell rating, and industry performance suggest a cautious outlook. Additionally, concerns about Apple's approach to AI spending and its potential competitive disadvantage compared to peers may contribute to a negative perception. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the stock. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend suggest that the stock may underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, Apple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.
