(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

However, the total revenue still showed an increase, suggesting that other aspects of the company's business are performing well. The introduction of artificial-intelligence software is awaited as a potential growth catalyst. Given the mixed nature of the report, with both a slight decline in a crucial product's sales and an overall increase in revenue, the market reaction could be muted. The slight miss in iPhone sales may lead to a short-term negative reaction, but the overall revenue growth and the anticipation of AI-driven growth could support the stock price.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}"
