      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\nNews Content: Apple CEO Tim Cook is a fan of DeepSeek's innovation. When an analyst asked the executive on the earnings call about what he thinks about the AI model from China, Cook replied: \u201cI think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips could negatively impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it suggests potential supply chain issues or challenges in product performance that rely on these semiconductors. As Apple is a major customer of STMicroelectronics, a decline in chip supply or an increase in costs could affect Apple's profit margins and product availability. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline, considering the interconnected nature of the chip supply chain and its direct impact on Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline \"Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\" suggests a positive, albeit subtle, sentiment from Apple's CEO regarding AI innovation from DeepSeek. While not a direct endorsement or investment announcement, Cook's acknowledgement signals an openness to external AI developments, which could be interpreted as a positive signal for Apple's future strategies, suggesting potential future integration or partnerships. Such positive signals typically have uptrending tendencies on stock prices, so I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of a price increase than a price decrease. However, the impact is likely to be small given the statement is not a major announcement. I am also factoring in the current overall market climate, where any positive AI mention is more likely to yield an uptrend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights a potential slowdown in iPhone sales due to a perceived missing refresh cycle.  Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, acknowledges the impact of COVID-19 on sales but focuses on future opportunities.  While the missing refresh cycle could indicate weaker near-term sales,  the emphasis on future opportunities suggests Apple is confident it can maintain growth. The market's reaction will depend on investor confidence in Apple's long-term strategy and its ability to drive future innovation and sales. A missing refresh cycle *could* lead to lower-than-expected sales in the short term, potentially impacting the stock price negatively. However, Apple's overall financial health and brand loyalty suggest this impact will likely be limited. The market likely already factored in a potential sales slowdown, and the focus on future opportunities might mitigate negative investor reaction. Therefore, a small price increase is more likely than a significant price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's iPhone sales growth, which accounts for half of its total revenue. Analysts expect only a 1.4% annual increase, indicating stagnation similar to previous years. This lack of significant growth could disappoint investors, potentially leading to a negative market reaction. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some downside risk. The market's reaction will likely hinge on whether the earnings report includes any positive surprises or forward-looking guidance that offsets the weak iPhone growth narrative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that an analyst, Antoine Chkaiban from New Street Research, remains concerned about Apple's prospects for the next couple of quarters. He cites three main reasons: 1) uncertainty about on-device AI enabling game-changing user experiences, 2) elongating replacement cycles for iPhones, and 3) stalled share gains in China due to intensifying competition. Despite Apple beating earnings expectations, the analyst's concerns could lead to a negative market perception, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, the positive earnings beat might mitigate some of the negative impact, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the total revenue still showed an increase, suggesting that other aspects of the company's business are performing well. The introduction of artificial-intelligence software is awaited as a potential growth catalyst. Given the mixed nature of the report, with both a slight decline in a crucial product's sales and an overall increase in revenue, the market reaction could be muted. The slight miss in iPhone sales may lead to a short-term negative reaction, but the overall revenue growth and the anticipation of AI-driven growth could support the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
