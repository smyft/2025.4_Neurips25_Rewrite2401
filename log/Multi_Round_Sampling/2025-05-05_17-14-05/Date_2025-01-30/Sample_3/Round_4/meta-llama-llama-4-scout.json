      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\nNews Content: Apple's (AAPL) earnings beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines for the fiscal first quarter despite some weakness in iPhone sales and missed revenue estimates in the Greater China region.\n\nNew Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to discuss the results and explain his reaction to the earnings print.\n\n\"We remain concerned about the next couple of quarters, and that's for a number of reasons,\" Chkaiban says, outlining three issues driving this concern for the iPhone maker in the near term.\n\n\"First, we're not convinced that on-device [artificial intelligence] AI will enable game-changing user experiences because the hardware is not game-changing,\" he says. \"Apple Intelligence features that are tightly integrated with the operating system, with iOS, have not really gotten great feedback so far.\"\n\n\"On top of that, you have elongating replacement cycles,\" Chkaiban explains, which only makes users less likely to justify upgrading their devices. \u76f8\u95dc\u5f71\u7247\n\n20:42\n\nApple Q1 earnings, market takeaways: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 01:35\n\nOne portfolio manager's picks to hedge tariff risk\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:17\n\nAre veteran transition programs seeing return on investment?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 14 hours ago\n\nFinally, \"you have the fact that share gains in China, which have been a tailwind in the past, have now stalled,\" he notes, highlighting Apple's struggle to compete in China as competition intensifies with domestic smartphone makers.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\n\u67e5\u770b\u7559\u8a00\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips could negatively impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it suggests potential supply chain issues or challenges in product performance that rely on these semiconductors. As Apple is a major customer of STMicroelectronics, a decline in chip supply or an increase in costs could affect Apple's profit margins and product availability. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline, considering the interconnected nature of the chip supply chain and its direct impact on Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline \"Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\" suggests a positive, albeit subtle, sentiment from Apple's CEO regarding AI innovation from DeepSeek. While not a direct endorsement or investment announcement, Cook's acknowledgement signals an openness to external AI developments, which could be interpreted as a positive signal for Apple's future strategies, suggesting potential future integration or partnerships. Such positive signals typically have uptrending tendencies on stock prices, so I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of a price increase than a price decrease. However, the impact is likely to be small given the statement is not a major announcement. I am also factoring in the current overall market climate, where any positive AI mention is more likely to yield an uptrend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights a potential slowdown in iPhone sales due to a perceived missing refresh cycle.  Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, acknowledges the impact of COVID-19 on sales but focuses on future opportunities.  While the missing refresh cycle could indicate weaker near-term sales,  the emphasis on future opportunities suggests Apple is confident it can maintain growth. The market's reaction will depend on investor confidence in Apple's long-term strategy and its ability to drive future innovation and sales. A missing refresh cycle *could* lead to lower-than-expected sales in the short term, potentially impacting the stock price negatively. However, Apple's overall financial health and brand loyalty suggest this impact will likely be limited. The market likely already factored in a potential sales slowdown, and the focus on future opportunities might mitigate negative investor reaction. Therefore, a small price increase is more likely than a significant price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's iPhone sales growth, which accounts for half of its total revenue. Analysts expect only a 1.4% annual increase, indicating stagnation similar to previous years. This lack of significant growth could disappoint investors, potentially leading to a negative market reaction. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some downside risk. The market's reaction will likely hinge on whether the earnings report includes any positive surprises or forward-looking guidance that offsets the weak iPhone growth narrative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that an analyst, Antoine Chkaiban from New Street Research, remains concerned about Apple's prospects for the next couple of quarters. He cites three main reasons: 1) uncertainty about on-device AI enabling game-changing user experiences, 2) elongating replacement cycles for iPhones, and 3) stalled share gains in China due to intensifying competition. Despite Apple beating earnings expectations, the analyst's concerns could lead to a negative market perception, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, the positive earnings beat might mitigate some of the negative impact, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the total revenue still showed an increase, suggesting that other aspects of the company's business are performing well. The introduction of artificial-intelligence software is awaited as a potential growth catalyst. Given the mixed nature of the report, with both a slight decline in a crucial product's sales and an overall increase in revenue, the market reaction could be muted. The slight miss in iPhone sales may lead to a short-term negative reaction, but the overall revenue growth and the anticipation of AI-driven growth could support the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy semiconductors raises concerns for Apple Inc. as a major customer. This situation can indicate potential supply chain issues or challenges in product availability that may adversely affect Apple's profit margins. Although some past analyses noted positive sentiments related to AI and other innovations at Apple, the direct impact of STMicroelectronics' forecast is likely to overshadow these aspects in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline because of the potential adverse effects on Apple's supply chain and demand for its products.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive sentiment from Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, regarding DeepSeek's AI innovation. While not a major announcement like a partnership or acquisition, his acknowledgement signals an openness to external AI developments, which could be seen as a positive sign for Apple's AI strategy. This is a small positive signal, especially given the current market interest in AI. Considering the previous round's varied predictions and the overall potentially muted impact of this single statement, I will lean slightly towards a price increase. Previous rounds demonstrated a mixed bag of results, with many believing the stock would decline. I will keep my prediction close to the middle to take into consideration the mixed opinions and small impact this sentence may actually have.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential slowdown in iPhone sales due to a perceived three-year refresh cycle. While this could negatively impact short-term sales, Cook's focus on future opportunities and the potential for growth in other product categories suggests a more nuanced outlook.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from a 25% to 60% probability of a price increase.  The significant variation highlights the uncertainty surrounding the market's reaction. The fact that the missing refresh cycle is acknowledged by Apple suggests it may already be factored into investor expectations.  While a short-term dip is possible, Apple's overall financial strength and brand loyalty could limit the extent of any decline. The lack of a significant negative surprise in the earnings report (mentioned in previous predictions, though details aren't fully provided here) further suggests a less drastic negative impact is likely. Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, a moderate probability of both price increase and decrease seems appropriate, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the overall strength of the company and the CEO's forward-looking statements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's iPhone sales growth, which accounts for half of its total revenue, with only a 1.4% annual increase expected. This stagnation could disappoint investors and lead to a negative market reaction. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and diversified product ecosystem might mitigate some downside risk. The market's reaction will likely depend on whether the earnings report includes any positive surprises or forward-looking guidance. Considering the previous predictions, which lean slightly towards a negative impact but with some mitigating factors, I estimate a balanced but cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'' and the content provided by analyst Antoine Chkaiban from New Street Research outline three main concerns: 1) uncertainty about on-device AI enabling game-changing user experiences, 2) elongating replacement cycles for iPhones, and 3) stalled share gains in China due to intensifying competition. Despite Apple beating earnings expectations, these concerns could lead to a negative market perception. However, the positive earnings beat might mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the concerns raised and the overall positive earnings report, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news reports a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the total revenue still showed an increase, suggesting that other aspects of the company's business are performing well. The introduction of artificial-intelligence software is awaited as a potential growth catalyst. Considering the mixed nature of the report and the overall market reaction, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising and falling. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential future growth opportunities, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the decline in iPhone sales. Taking into account the mixed report and the overall market sentiment, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a minor decline in iPhone sales, which is the company's most valuable product. This miss against projections, coupled with the anticipation that artificial-intelligence software hasn't driven significant growth yet, indicates potential short-term investor caution. However, total revenue did see positive growth, and Apple's diversified offerings might offset some concerns. The mix of negative and neutral-positive elements leads to a balanced outlook. Considering previous predictions, there's a general consensus of slight pessimism, with some models predicting minimal movements. Hence, while a modest probability of decline is indicated, the mixed scenario could also result in a stable stock performance.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips raises concerns for Apple Inc., given its reliance on such semiconductor products. This situation indicates potential supply chain issues that could negatively impact Apple's profit margins and product availability. The previous predictions lean towards negative sentiment due to declining iPhone sales, diverse challenges faced by Apple, and cautious market reactions. Despite some analysts factoring in Apple's overall financial strength and brand loyalty, the direct implications of reduced chip demand and iPhone sales are likely to outweigh any positive sentiments about future innovations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019' suggests a positive, albeit weak, sentiment from Apple's CEO regarding AI innovation from a Chinese company. This can be interpreted as a signal of Apple's openness to external AI developments, and potentially, future collaborations. However, the statement is generic and does not indicate any concrete plans or partnerships. The previous predictions, even those reacting to seemingly more impactful news (like sales declines or concerns raised by analysts), show a divergence of opinion. The general sentiment toward apple has been lukewarm as it is at best a mixed bag of iPhone sales and AI catalyst. I will adjust the probability slightly towards an uptrend compared to others predictions, but it will not be so as not to be heavily influenced.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's 'missing refresh cycle' presents a mixed picture.  While a slowdown in iPhone sales is concerning, especially given its significant contribution to Apple's revenue,  Cook's emphasis on future opportunities suggests a long-term optimistic outlook. The previous predictions show significant disagreement, ranging from a 20% probability of a price increase to an 80% probability of a price decrease. This divergence highlights considerable uncertainty in the market's reaction.  Several models cite concerns about weakening demand due to possibly elongating iPhone replacement cycles and competition in China.  However, Apple's overall financial health, brand loyalty, and diversification across products mitigate some of the downside risk.  The lack of a strong negative reaction to the earnings announcement (as hinted at in the previous round's predictions) suggests the market may have already partially priced in a potential sales slowdown.  Considering this, combined with the conflicting predictions and the mixed nature of the news itself, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price decline due to the immediate concern of slower iPhone sales but acknowledge a significant chance of stable or slightly positive movement due to the company's resilience and potential for future growth in other sectors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's iPhone sales growth, which is a critical revenue driver, with only a 1.4% annual increase expected. This stagnation could disappoint investors, leading to a negative market reaction. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some downside risk. The market's reaction will likely depend on whether the earnings report includes any positive surprises or forward-looking guidance. Considering the previous predictions, which lean slightly towards a negative impact but with some mitigating factors, I estimate a balanced but cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'' outlines concerns from analyst Antoine Chkaiban about Apple's near-term prospects. Despite Apple beating earnings expectations, the analyst cites uncertainty about on-device AI, elongating replacement cycles for iPhones, and stalled share gains in China due to intensifying competition. These concerns could lead to a negative market perception, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, the positive earnings beat might mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the mixed nature of the report and the overall market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news reports a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the total revenue still showed an increase, suggesting that other aspects of the company's business are performing well. The introduction of artificial-intelligence software is awaited as a potential growth catalyst. Considering the mixed nature of the report and the overall market reaction, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising and falling. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential future growth opportunities, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the decline in iPhone sales. Taking into account the mixed report and the overall market sentiment, I predict a slightly higher of the stock price falling than rising. Given the slight decline in iPhone sales and the mixed reactions from previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.42 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a minor decline in iPhone sales, which is the company's most valuable product. This miss against projections, coupled with the anticipation that artificial-intelligence software hasn't driven significant growth yet, indicates potential short-term investor caution. However, total revenue did see positive growth, and Apple's diversified offerings might offset some concerns. The mix of negative and neutral-positive elements leads to a balanced outlook. Considering previous predictions, there's a general consensus of slight pessimism, with some models predicting minimal movements. Hence, while a modest probability of decline is indicated, the mixed scenario could also result in a stable stock performance.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy semiconductors raises significant concerns for Apple Inc., given its reliance on these chips. This suggests potential supply chain issues that may negatively impact Apple's product availability and margins. While there are assorted previous predictions highlighting both positive and negative sentiments about Apple's future, the overarching narrative indicates heightened caution due to the decline in expected iPhone sales growth and the challenges posed by current market conditions. Consequently, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline, reflecting the potential adverse impact on Apple from reduced chip demand and an uncertain sales outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mildly positive sentiment from Tim Cook towards DeepSeek's AI innovation. This suggests Apple's openness to external AI development and potential future collaboration. While not a major announcement, it offers a small positive signal for Apple's strategic direction in AI, a sector with significant investor interest. \n\nConsidering the mixed opinions from the previous rounds, and the overall luke warm sentiment surrounding Apple (stagnating iphone sales, etc.), I will slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise . Given this sentiment mixed with a neutral AI comment, I do not adjust the probabilities too drastically. \n\nNote on previous predictions: I will not take the negative sentiment of STM into consideration since the news article is not directly tied to that.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's 'missing refresh cycle' and concerns about slowing iPhone sales presents a mixed outlook.  While the slowdown is a significant concern given the iPhone's contribution to revenue, Cook's focus on future opportunities and the potential for growth in other product categories offers a counterbalance.  The previous predictions demonstrate considerable disagreement and uncertainty, with probabilities ranging widely for both price increases and decreases.  Multiple models highlight weakening demand due to potentially elongating iPhone replacement cycles and competition in China.  However, Apple's strong financial health, brand loyalty, and diversified product portfolio mitigate some of the negative impact. The lack of a dramatic negative reaction to the earnings announcement (as hinted in earlier predictions) suggests the market may have already partially accounted for a possible sales slowdown.  The consistent concern over the semiconductor supply chain, as evidenced by the STMicroelectronics news, adds to the downside pressure. Considering this mix of factors, the overall uncertainty, and the diverse range of previous predictions, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price decline in the short term due to immediate concerns over iPhone sales. However, the likelihood of a significant drop is tempered by the company's overall resilience and potential for future growth.  The probabilities are kept relatively close, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's iPhone sales growth, which accounts for half of its total revenue, with only a 1.4% annual increase expected.

Considering the decline in iPhone sales, which accounts for a significant portion of Apple's revenue, there is a potential for negative market reaction. However, the overall revenue increase and the diversified product ecosystem might mitigate some downside risk. The introduction of artificial-intelligence software is awaited as a potential growth catalyst, which could positively impact the stock price. Analyzing the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus of slight pessimism, with some models predicting minimal movements.
