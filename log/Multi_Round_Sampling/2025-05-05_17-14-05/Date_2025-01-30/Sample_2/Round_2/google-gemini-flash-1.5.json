(AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights strong iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence software is available, as noted by Tim Cook. The reported year-over-year performance improvement for the iPhone 16 family suggests positive consumer sentiment and sales performance. This strong demand, especially in regions with the new technology, indicates a likely positive impact on Apple's revenue and overall market performance. As a result, there is a higher probability that the stock price will rise compared to it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. Firstly, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 YTD. Secondly, the Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell), indicating anticipated underperformance based on unfavorable earnings estimate revisions leading up to the report. The industry Apple belongs to also has a below-average ranking. This suggests the sector might face headwinds. Management commentary in the earnings call will be critical. While beating estimates is positive, the analysts expectations are pessimistic. Therefore the current surprise may not continue moving forward. Factoring these elements into account, I believe that there is still a high chance of the stock falling. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple reported 6% revenue growth driven by new products and AI integration, the broader context is negative.  Hedge funds are reducing their tech positions due to concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups (like DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainty.  Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish long-term outlook on AI, but short-term market sentiment seems bearish regarding US tech stocks.  Apple's positive Q4 earnings are a counterpoint to this broader negative sentiment, but the overall market reaction to the general AI sector news likely outweighs the positive impact of Apple's individual performance in the short term.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is deemed slightly higher than the probability of a rise, reflecting the current market headwinds impacting even strong performers in the tech sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. While Apple is mentioned as a customer, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Apple's reliance on STMicroelectronics for legacy chips may be limited, as Apple typically uses advanced chips for its products. However, any supply chain concerns could introduce minor negative sentiment. Overall, the impact is likely neutral to slightly negative, but not significant enough to strongly influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple Inc. is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion. This indicates potential for further growth as the company can target existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices like Macs, iPads, or Watches. The positive outlook on Apple's customer base expansion and potential for increased sales across its ecosystem likely has a favorable impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, but it does not provide any information about the report's expected content or potential surprises. However, the article also mentions that other major tech companies, such as Tesla and Meta, have reported mixed results, with Tesla missing earnings estimates but rising on growth projections, and Meta topping profit forecasts. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech industry, its stock price may be influenced by the overall sentiment and trends in the sector. Since the news about other companies is mixed, it is difficult to predict the direction of Apple's stock price movement with certainty. Nevertheless, the fact that Apple's report is scheduled for release soon may lead to increased volatility and speculation, which could result in a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising if the report is expected to be positive, but this is highly uncertain.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive revenue growth for Apple Inc. driven by new product launches and AI integration. However, the overall tech sector faces challenges due to increased competition, particularly from Chinese startups, and regulatory uncertainties. On one hand, the revenue growth and product launches suggest positive market reaction. On the other hand, the broader negative sentiment in the tech sector could offset these positives.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone demand is particularly strong in markets where the Apple Intelligence software is available, suggesting robust sales performance. CEO Tim Cook's comments on the iPhone 16 family outperforming the previous generation can foster positive sentiment among investors, likely leading to expectations of higher revenues. However, the current market sentiment remains mixed, with multiple analysts expressing caution due to broader tech sector challenges and competition. Taking all these factors into account, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising due to the positive news about iPhone demand, balanced against the existing cautious outlook in the broader market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter, indicating a strong performance. However, it's crucial to consider the context. The company has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests potential near-term underperformance due to unfavorable earnings estimate revisions. Additionally, Apple's industry rank is in the bottom 28%, signaling headwinds for the sector. While beating estimates is a positive sign, the negative sentiment reflected in the Zacks Rank and industry outlook cannot be ignored. The estimates that lead to the sell rating are still there even after the earnings release. Taking those into consideration, along with mixed previous predictions, puts slightly higher weight on a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported 6% revenue growth, exceeding expectations, driven by new products and AI integration. This is positive. However, the broader context is mixed.  Hedge funds are cautious about the tech sector due to Chinese competition (DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainty. Goldman Sachs is bullish long-term on AI, but short-term sentiment towards US tech is bearish.  The positive Q4 results are countered by the prevailing negative tech sector sentiment. While Apple's strong performance is a positive factor, the overall market headwinds likely have a stronger influence in the short term. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, a neutral to slightly positive outlook seems appropriate.  The previous predictions ranged widely (0.4 to 0.75 for a price rise), indicating uncertainty. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise based on Apple's strong Q4 performance, but acknowledge the considerable external uncertainties.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a sales decline forecast by STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, due to weak demand for legacy chips. While Apple is mentioned as a customer, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Apple's reliance on STMicroelectronics for legacy chips may be limited, as Apple typically uses advanced chips for its products. However, any supply chain concerns could introduce minor negative sentiment. The previous predictions show a mixed outlook, with some models leaning towards a rise due to positive revenue growth and product launches, while others consider broader negative sentiment in the tech sector. Given the uncertainty and the mixed signals from the news and previous predictions, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Is Still Finding New Customers' and the content highlighting Apple's growing installed base of devices reaching over 2.35 billion, suggest that the company has potential for further growth. This is because Apple can target existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices like Macs, iPads, or Watches. The positive outlook on Apple's customer base expansion and potential for increased sales across its ecosystem likely has a favorable impact on investor sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of both positive and negative sentiments. However, the overall trend suggests that the positive aspects of Apple's growth potential and customer base expansion may outweigh the negative factors. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides mixed signals about the tech sector, with some companies like Tesla and Meta reporting mixed results. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's quarterly report, which is scheduled for release after the closing bell Thursday. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of it falling. Considering the mixed sentiment in the tech sector and the lack of specific information about Apple's report, I will take a moderate stance. The overall market reaction to the general AI sector news and the performance of other major tech companies may have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, since Apple's report is scheduled for release soon, there may be increased volatility and speculation, which could result in a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising if the report is expected to be positive.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strong 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 for Apple Inc., driven by new product launches such as the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. The integration of AI across the product ecosystem, including the introduction of Apple Intelligence, has contributed positively to user engagement and satisfaction. However, the broader context includes bearish sentiments due to reduced tech positions by hedge funds, competitive pressures from Chinese AI startups, and regulatory uncertainties. Goldman Sachs maintains a positive long-term outlook on AI, which counters some short-term pessimism. The overall sentiment appears somewhat mixed.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
