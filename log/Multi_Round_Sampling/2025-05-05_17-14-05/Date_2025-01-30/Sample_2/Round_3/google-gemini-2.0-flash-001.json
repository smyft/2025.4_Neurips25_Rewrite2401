(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights strong iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence software is available, as noted by Tim Cook. The reported year-over-year performance improvement for the iPhone 16 family suggests positive consumer sentiment and sales performance. This strong demand, especially in regions with the new technology, indicates a likely positive impact on Apple's revenue and overall market performance. As a result, there is a higher probability that the stock price will rise compared to it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. Firstly, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 YTD. Secondly, the Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell), indicating anticipated underperformance based on unfavorable earnings estimate revisions leading up to the report. The industry Apple belongs to also has a below-average ranking. This suggests the sector might face headwinds. Management commentary in the earnings call will be critical. While beating estimates is positive, the analysts expectations are pessimistic. Therefore the current surprise may not continue moving forward. Factoring these elements into account, I believe that there is still a high chance of the stock falling. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple reported 6% revenue growth driven by new products and AI integration, the broader context is negative.  Hedge funds are reducing their tech positions due to concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups (like DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainty.  Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish long-term outlook on AI, but short-term market sentiment seems bearish regarding US tech stocks.  Apple's positive Q4 earnings are a counterpoint to this broader negative sentiment, but the overall market reaction to the general AI sector news likely outweighs the positive impact of Apple's individual performance in the short term.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is deemed slightly higher than the probability of a rise, reflecting the current market headwinds impacting even strong performers in the tech sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. While Apple is mentioned as a customer, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Apple's reliance on STMicroelectronics for legacy chips may be limited, as Apple typically uses advanced chips for its products. However, any supply chain concerns could introduce minor negative sentiment. Overall, the impact is likely neutral to slightly negative, but not significant enough to strongly influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple Inc. is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion. This indicates potential for further growth as the company can target existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices like Macs, iPads, or Watches. The positive outlook on Apple's customer base expansion and potential for increased sales across its ecosystem likely has a favorable impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, but it does not provide any information about the report's expected content or potential surprises. However, the article also mentions that other major tech companies, such as Tesla and Meta, have reported mixed results, with Tesla missing earnings estimates but rising on growth projections, and Meta topping profit forecasts. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech industry, its stock price may be influenced by the overall sentiment and trends in the sector. Since the news about other companies is mixed, it is difficult to predict the direction of Apple's stock price movement with certainty. Nevertheless, the fact that Apple's report is scheduled for release soon may lead to increased volatility and speculation, which could result in a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising if the report is expected to be positive, but this is highly uncertain.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive revenue growth for Apple Inc. driven by new product launches and AI integration. However, the overall tech sector faces challenges due to increased competition, particularly from Chinese startups, and regulatory uncertainties. On one hand, the revenue growth and product launches suggest positive market reaction. On the other hand, the broader negative sentiment in the tech sector could offset these positives.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone demand is particularly strong in markets where the Apple Intelligence software is available, suggesting robust sales performance. CEO Tim Cook's comments on the iPhone 16 family outperforming the previous generation can foster positive sentiment among investors, likely leading to expectations of higher revenues. However, the current market sentiment remains mixed, with multiple analysts expressing caution due to broader tech sector challenges and competition. Taking all these factors into account, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising due to the positive news about iPhone demand, balanced against the existing cautious outlook in the broader market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter, indicating a strong performance. However, it's crucial to consider the context. The company has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests potential near-term underperformance due to unfavorable earnings estimate revisions. Additionally, Apple's industry rank is in the bottom 28%, signaling headwinds for the sector. While beating estimates is a positive sign, the negative sentiment reflected in the Zacks Rank and industry outlook cannot be ignored. The estimates that lead to the sell rating are still there even after the earnings release. Taking those into consideration, along with mixed previous predictions, puts slightly higher weight on a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported 6% revenue growth, exceeding expectations, driven by new products and AI integration. This is positive. However, the broader context is mixed.  Hedge funds are cautious about the tech sector due to Chinese competition (DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainty. Goldman Sachs is bullish long-term on AI, but short-term sentiment towards US tech is bearish.  The positive Q4 results are countered by the prevailing negative tech sector sentiment. While Apple's strong performance is a positive factor, the overall market headwinds likely have a stronger influence in the short term. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, a neutral to slightly positive outlook seems appropriate.  The previous predictions ranged widely (0.4 to 0.75 for a price rise), indicating uncertainty. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise based on Apple's strong Q4 performance, but acknowledge the considerable external uncertainties.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a sales decline forecast by STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, due to weak demand for legacy chips. While Apple is mentioned as a customer, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Apple's reliance on STMicroelectronics for legacy chips may be limited, as Apple typically uses advanced chips for its products. However, any supply chain concerns could introduce minor negative sentiment. The previous predictions show a mixed outlook, with some models leaning towards a rise due to positive revenue growth and product launches, while others consider broader negative sentiment in the tech sector. Given the uncertainty and the mixed signals from the news and previous predictions, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Is Still Finding New Customers' and the content highlighting Apple's growing installed base of devices reaching over 2.35 billion, suggest that the company has potential for further growth. This is because Apple can target existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices like Macs, iPads, or Watches. The positive outlook on Apple's customer base expansion and potential for increased sales across its ecosystem likely has a favorable impact on investor sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of both positive and negative sentiments. However, the overall trend suggests that the positive aspects of Apple's growth potential and customer base expansion may outweigh the negative factors. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides mixed signals about the tech sector, with some companies like Tesla and Meta reporting mixed results. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's quarterly report, which is scheduled for release after the closing bell Thursday. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of it falling. Considering the mixed sentiment in the tech sector and the lack of specific information about Apple's report, I will take a moderate stance. The overall market reaction to the general AI sector news and the performance of other major tech companies may have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, since Apple's report is scheduled for release soon, there may be increased volatility and speculation, which could result in a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising if the report is expected to be positive.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strong 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 for Apple Inc., driven by new product launches such as the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. The integration of AI across the product ecosystem, including the introduction of Apple Intelligence, has contributed positively to user engagement and satisfaction. However, the broader context includes bearish sentiments due to reduced tech positions by hedge funds, competitive pressures from Chinese AI startups, and regulatory uncertainties. Goldman Sachs maintains a positive long-term outlook on AI, which counters some short-term pessimism. The overall sentiment appears somewhat mixed.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is experiencing strong iPhone demand in markets where its AI software is implemented, which suggests positive consumer sentiment and sales performance. CEO Tim Cook's comments about the iPhone 16 family outperforming the previous generation bolster this positive outlook. However, broader tech sector challenges, such as competition from Chinese startups and regulatory uncertainties, provide a counterbalance of caution among analysts. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some models leaning positively while others reflect concerns about the overall market. Taking these factors into account, the probability of the stock rising is higher due to the strength in iPhone sales, tempered by mixed broader market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates in Q1, which is generally a positive sign. However, Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell), suggesting potential near-term underperformance based on unfavorable earnings estimate revisions. The company's industry also has a below-average ranking. The estimate revisions trend before the earnings release were unfavorable, further suggesting that the stock might underperform. The management's commentary on the earnings call will be crucial. Considering these mixed signals, I slightly tilt towards the stock price falling, but the earnings beat prevents a strong negative prediction. Previous rounds show a decrease in optimism from round 0 to round 1, with predictions varying widely. This suggests that while the earnings beat provided some initial optimism, analysts quickly focused on the underlying issues.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported strong Q4 2024 revenue growth, exceeding expectations. This positive performance, driven by new product launches and AI integration, is a bullish signal.  However, the broader market context presents a mixed picture. Hedge funds are reducing their tech holdings due to concerns about Chinese AI competition and regulatory uncertainty. While Goldman Sachs holds a positive long-term view on AI, short-term market sentiment for US tech seems bearish.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  Apple's positive Q4 results are a significant positive factor, but the negative broader tech sector sentiment and the uncertainty surrounding the future impact of AI competition need to be considered. Weighing these factors, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price rise due to the company's strong performance, but the overall market headwinds and uncertainty reduce this probability from a more optimistic assessment. The consensus from previous models also contributes to this more moderate prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a sales decline forecast by STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, due to weak demand for legacy chips.

Given the uncertainty and the mixed signals from the news and previous predictions, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a negative impact due to the broader tech sector challenges and the potential for minor supply chain concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Is Still Finding New Customers' indicates a positive outlook for Apple's growth potential. The company's installed base of devices has reached over 2.35 billion, suggesting there is still room for growth by convincing existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices such as Macs, iPads, or Watches. This potential for ecosystem expansion is a positive factor. However, previous predictions from other models show a mixed outlook due to broader tech sector challenges, competition, and regulatory uncertainties. Despite these challenges, the overall sentiment from the news and previous predictions leans slightly towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provided does not give specific information about Apple's quarterly report, which is scheduled for release after the closing bell Thursday.
