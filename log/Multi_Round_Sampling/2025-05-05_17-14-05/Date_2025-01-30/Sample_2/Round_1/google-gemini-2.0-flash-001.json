(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights strong iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence software is available, as noted by Tim Cook. The reported year-over-year performance improvement for the iPhone 16 family suggests positive consumer sentiment and sales performance. This strong demand, especially in regions with the new technology, indicates a likely positive impact on Apple's revenue and overall market performance. As a result, there is a higher probability that the stock price will rise compared to it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. Firstly, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 YTD. Secondly, the Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell), indicating anticipated underperformance based on unfavorable earnings estimate revisions leading up to the report. The industry Apple belongs to also has a below-average ranking. This suggests the sector might face headwinds. Management commentary in the earnings call will be critical. While beating estimates is positive, the analysts expectations are pessimistic. Therefore the current surprise may not continue moving forward. Factoring these elements into account, I believe that there is still a high chance of the stock falling. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple reported 6% revenue growth driven by new products and AI integration, the broader context is negative.  Hedge funds are reducing their tech positions due to concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups (like DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainty.  Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish long-term outlook on AI, but short-term market sentiment seems bearish regarding US tech stocks.  Apple's positive Q4 earnings are a counterpoint to this broader negative sentiment, but the overall market reaction to the general AI sector news likely outweighs the positive impact of Apple's individual performance in the short term.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is deemed slightly higher than the probability of a rise, reflecting the current market headwinds impacting even strong performers in the tech sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports that STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. While Apple is mentioned as a customer, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Apple's reliance on STMicroelectronics for legacy chips may be limited, as Apple typically uses advanced chips for its products. However, any supply chain concerns could introduce minor negative sentiment. Overall, the impact is likely neutral to slightly negative, but not significant enough to strongly influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple Inc. is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion. This indicates potential for further growth as the company can target existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices like Macs, iPads, or Watches. The positive outlook on Apple's customer base expansion and potential for increased sales across its ecosystem likely has a favorable impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, but it does not provide any information about the report's expected content or potential surprises. However, the article also mentions that other major tech companies, such as Tesla and Meta, have reported mixed results, with Tesla missing earnings estimates but rising on growth projections, and Meta topping profit forecasts. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech industry, its stock price may be influenced by the overall sentiment and trends in the sector. Since the news about other companies is mixed, it is difficult to predict the direction of Apple's stock price movement with certainty. Nevertheless, the fact that Apple's report is scheduled for release soon may lead to increased volatility and speculation, which could result in a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising if the report is expected to be positive, but this is highly uncertain.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive revenue growth for Apple Inc. driven by new product launches and AI integration. However, the overall tech sector faces challenges due to increased competition, particularly from Chinese startups, and regulatory uncertainties. On one hand, the revenue growth and product launches suggest positive market reaction. On the other hand, the broader negative sentiment in the tech sector could offset these positives.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
