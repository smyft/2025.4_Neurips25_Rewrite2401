      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\nNews Content: The chip maker\u2014which counts Apple, Samsung Electronics and Tesla among its customers\u2014expects lower sales, as demand for legacy semiconductors remains subdued.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has surpassed earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting that expectations for future growth are dimming. The company has underperformed the market this year, which raises caution among investors. Overall, while the immediate reaction to the earnings surprise could yield a positive response, the negative sentiment in revisions and underperformance weigh heavily on the outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, primarily driven by its Services segment, iPhone sales declined. This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests a positive initial response, likely because the beat on earnings was considered more important than the iPhone sales decline by investors at that moment. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales remains uncertain and could weigh on the stock price over time. Therefore, while there's a higher probability of a short-term price rise due to the positive earnings beat, the longer-term outlook is less clear, leading to a higher probability of price fluctuation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. If iPhone demand meets or exceeds expectations, the stock could rise. If demand disappoints, the stock could fall. Given the mixed sentiment (positive earnings growth but uncertainty around iPhone demand), the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise due to the overall positive earnings outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Apple, Tesla, and Samsung, forecasts a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This news may negatively impact Apple's stock price as it suggests potential supply chain disruptions or decreased component demand, which could affect Apple's production and sales. However, the direct impact on Apple might be limited as the news is more about STMicroelectronics' forecast and the demand for legacy chips, which may not directly correlate with Apple's current product lineup or future plans. Considering this, there's a slight inclination towards a negative impact but with moderate probabilities due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which is a positive indicator for the company's potential for future growth. The fact that Apple is seeing rapid growth in new customers and has opportunities to convince existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices, such as Macs, iPads, or Watches, implies that the company has a strong potential for expanding its revenue streams. This information is likely to be viewed positively by investors, which could lead to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Tesla and Apple, forecasts a decline in sales due to weak demand for legacy chips. This suggests potential supply chain issues affecting both Tesla and Apple. Since Apple relies on chip suppliers like STMicroelectronics, a decrease in their sales volume could imply challenges in obtaining components, potentially impacting Apple's production and shipment timelines. However, considering Apple's diversified supply chain and stronger bargaining power, the direct impact might be limited. Yet, market sentiment may cause investors to reassess their positions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has exceeded earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are unfavorable estimate revisions leading to a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting a cautious outlook. The company's year-to-date underperformance versus the S&P 500 adds to the uncertainty. While positive earnings surprises can lead to short-term price increases, the mixed sentiment regarding future growth prospects, particularly relating to iPhone demand and overall industry outlook, introduces significant caution. Therefore, there is a balanced view, but slightly leaning towards a probability of decline due to the negative factors impacting future performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's continued ability to attract new customers and grow its installed base. This is generally positive as it indicates sustained demand and future growth potential, especially with cross-selling opportunities within the Apple ecosystem. Considering previous sentiment, there appears to be a balance between whether beat earning is enough to offset negative information such as iPhone decline, with most leaning towards rise. However, some were more pessimistic, highlighting supplier issues, which proved to have some negative impact. This specific news, combined with previous opinions, it still suggests higher probability of stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, the decline in iPhone sales is a significant concern, as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The initial market reaction was positive (stock rose in extended trading), suggesting investors prioritized the earnings beat. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales is uncertain and could negatively affect investor sentiment.  The previous predictions are varied, with some emphasizing the positive earnings beat and others highlighting the iPhone sales decline.  Considering the mixed nature of the news and the divergence of opinions among the previous models, a moderately positive outlook is favored, but with a significant chance of price fluctuation. The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the initial market reaction and the exceeding of earnings expectations, but the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales keeps the probability of a fall relatively high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. The mixed sentiment from previous predictions shows a balance between optimism about earnings growth and caution regarding iPhone demand. Given the overall positive earnings outlook but uncertainty around iPhone demand, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline suggests that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Apple, forecasts a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price as it implies potential supply chain disruptions or decreased component demand. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong bargaining power might mitigate the direct impact. Considering the indirect nature of the news and Apple's recent performance, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. However, the overall impact is expected to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) as the company continues to find new customers and grow its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion. This growth indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth, especially with opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some emphasizing the positive earnings report and others highlighting concerns such as declining iPhone sales or supply chain issues, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a cautious optimism. However, the direct news provided focuses on the growth of Apple's customer base and potential for further expansion, which is likely to be viewed positively by investors. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, based on this piece of news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential decline in sales for STMicroelectronics, a key supplier to Apple. This might signal possible supply chain constraints for Apple, affecting their ability to produce necessary components. Although Apple has a diversified supply chain, any uncertainty around component availability can cause anxiety among investors. The recent rounds of predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a negative impact and others towards a positive one. Considering the indirect nature of the impact and historical underperformance concerns, the probability of the stock price falling appears slightly higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows it has exceeded earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong financial performance. However, investor sentiment is tempered by negative estimates revisions and concerns over declining iPhone sales, a major revenue driver. The mixed signals from the earnings report and future estimates create uncertainty. Despite the positive earnings surprise, the Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) and underperformance compared to the market suggest caution. Therefore, while there's still potential for some upward movement due to the earnings beat, the negative factors contribute to a considerable probability of a decline as well. The probabilities are informed by previous predictions that reflect a leaning toward cautious optimism but also recognize significant downside risk.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's continued ability to attract new customers, leading to a growing installed base. This suggests sustained demand and future growth potential, particularly with cross-selling opportunities (Macs, iPads, Watches). While iPhone sales are a point of concern based on previous rounds, a growing user base provides a buffer. The previous round saw predictions varying, but slightly leaning towards a price rise, even when supply chain concerns and iPhone troubles were factored in. This latest news further reinforces a positive outlook. Therefore, likelihood of price increase is slightly more promising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, the decline in iPhone sales is a significant concern, as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The initial market reaction was positive (stock rose in extended trading), suggesting investors prioritized the earnings beat. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales is uncertain and could negatively affect investor sentiment. The previous predictions are varied, reflecting this uncertainty.  Some models emphasize the positive earnings beat and the growth in services and new customers, while others highlight the iPhone sales decline and potential supply chain issues (indirectly suggested by STMicroelectronics' news). Considering the mixed nature of the news and the divergence of opinions among the previous models, a cautiously optimistic outlook is warranted. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the initial positive market reaction and the exceeding of earnings expectations, but the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales and the less positive predictions of several models suggests a substantial chance of a price fall. The overall sentiment leans toward a slight increase in the short term, however longer term uncertainty and the potential for further negative news could increase probability of a fall over time. Taking the average of the previous round's predictions of increase and decrease results in 0.52 rise and 0.48 fall respectively.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. The mixed sentiment from previous predictions shows a balance between optimism about earnings growth and caution regarding iPhone demand. Given the overall positive earnings outlook but uncertainty around iPhone demand, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. This is because STMicroelectronics is a supplier to Apple, and a decline in their sales could imply potential supply chain disruptions or decreased component demand. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong bargaining power might mitigate the direct impact. Considering the mixed sentiments from previous predictions and the indirect nature of the news, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. However, Apple's recent earnings report showing strong performance and growth in its installed base also suggests a positive outlook. Balancing these factors, the probabilities are estimated with a cautious approach.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple is still finding new customers, with a growing installed base of devices reaching over 2.35 billion. This growth indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The opportunity for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem is also a positive factor. Considering the previous predictions, most models lean towards a cautious optimism, with some emphasizing the positive earnings report and others highlighting concerns such as declining iPhone sales or supply chain issues. However, the direct news provided focuses on the growth of Apple's customer base and potential for further expansion, which is likely to be viewed positively by investors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential decline in sales for STMicroelectronics, a key supplier to Apple. This might signal possible supply chain constraints for Apple, affecting their ability to produce necessary components. Although Apple has a diversified supply chain, any uncertainty around component availability can cause anxiety among investors. The recent rounds of predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a negative impact and others towards a positive one. Considering the indirect nature of the impact and historical underperformance concerns, the probability of the stock price falling appears slightly higher.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report indicates a solid performance, with earnings and revenue surpassing estimates. This suggests a positive short-term sentiment among investors. However, there are notable concerns regarding declining iPhone sales, which are a critical revenue driver, and unfavorable estimate revisions leading to a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). While there is potential for a short-term price rise due to the earnings beat, the mixed signals and negative outlook for future growth weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a probability slightly favoring a fall in stock price due to these concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's ability to attract new customers, contributing to its growing installed base. This is generally positive, signaling sustained demand and future growth, enhanced by potential cross-selling opportunities within the Apple ecosystem. While concerns around iPhone sales have lingered, the expanding user base acts as a mitigating factor. Considering the previous rounds of mixed predictions, where concerns about supply chain issues and iPhone sales were balanced against overall earnings and business model strength, the positive note of acquiring new customers strengthens the sentiment for a price increase moving forward, I will put the likelihood of price increase more prominent.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. Apple beat earnings expectations, driven by its Services segment, but iPhone sales declined. This is significant as iPhones are a major revenue driver. The initial market reaction was positive (stock rose in extended trading), suggesting investors prioritized the earnings beat. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales is uncertain and could outweigh the positive earnings news.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, some optimistic due to the earnings beat and Services growth, others pessimistic due to declining iPhone sales and potential supply chain issues (indirectly suggested by STMicroelectronics' news). The consensus leans slightly towards a price rise, but the uncertainty is substantial.  The probability of a price rise is higher in the short-term due to the positive initial market response and earnings beat, but the long-term outlook is less clear.  Considering the mixed nature of the news and the diverse range of predictions among the models, a moderately positive outlook is warranted, with a significant chance of price fluctuation. I've incorporated both the direct news and the evolving consensus from previous model predictions, weighting the short-term positive effects against the longer-term uncertainty related to iPhone sales.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue.

Given the overall positive earnings outlook but uncertainty around iPhone demand, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price, as it implies potential supply chain disruptions or decreased component demand. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong bargaining power might mitigate the direct impact. Additionally, Apple's recent earnings report shows strong performance and growth in its installed base, suggesting a positive outlook. The mixed sentiments from previous predictions and the indirect nature of the news suggest a cautious approach. Considering the overall positive earnings outlook, growth in the installed base, and concerns around iPhone demand and supply chain, the probabilities are estimated with a slight tilt towards a rise but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices suggests a positive outlook for the company's potential for future growth. This growth indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for further expansion, especially with opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem. Considering the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, most models lean towards a cautious optimism, with some emphasizing the positive earnings report and others highlighting concerns such as declining iPhone sales or supply chain issues.
