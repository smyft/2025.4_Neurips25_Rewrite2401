(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has surpassed earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting that expectations for future growth are dimming. The company has underperformed the market this year, which raises caution among investors. Overall, while the immediate reaction to the earnings surprise could yield a positive response, the negative sentiment in revisions and underperformance weigh heavily on the outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, primarily driven by its Services segment, iPhone sales declined. This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests a positive initial response, likely because the beat on earnings was considered more important than the iPhone sales decline by investors at that moment. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales remains uncertain and could weigh on the stock price over time. Therefore, while there's a higher probability of a short-term price rise due to the positive earnings beat, the longer-term outlook is less clear, leading to a higher probability of price fluctuation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. If iPhone demand meets or exceeds expectations, the stock could rise. If demand disappoints, the stock could fall. Given the mixed sentiment (positive earnings growth but uncertainty around iPhone demand), the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise due to the overall positive earnings outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Apple, Tesla, and Samsung, forecasts a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This news may negatively impact Apple's stock price as it suggests potential supply chain disruptions or decreased component demand, which could affect Apple's production and sales. However, the direct impact on Apple might be limited as the news is more about STMicroelectronics' forecast and the demand for legacy chips, which may not directly correlate with Apple's current product lineup or future plans. Considering this, there's a slight inclination towards a negative impact but with moderate probabilities due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which is a positive indicator for the company's potential for future growth. The fact that Apple is seeing rapid growth in new customers and has opportunities to convince existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices, such as Macs, iPads, or Watches, implies that the company has a strong potential for expanding its revenue streams. This information is likely to be viewed positively by investors, which could lead to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Tesla and Apple, forecasts a decline in sales due to weak demand for legacy chips. This suggests potential supply chain issues affecting both Tesla and Apple. Since Apple relies on chip suppliers like STMicroelectronics, a decrease in their sales volume could imply challenges in obtaining components, potentially impacting Apple's production and shipment timelines. However, considering Apple's diversified supply chain and stronger bargaining power, the direct impact might be limited. Yet, market sentiment may cause investors to reassess their positions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has exceeded earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are unfavorable estimate revisions leading to a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting a cautious outlook. The company's year-to-date underperformance versus the S&P 500 adds to the uncertainty. While positive earnings surprises can lead to short-term price increases, the mixed sentiment regarding future growth prospects, particularly relating to iPhone demand and overall industry outlook, introduces significant caution. Therefore, there is a balanced view, but slightly leaning towards a probability of decline due to the negative factors impacting future performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's continued ability to attract new customers and grow its installed base. This is generally positive as it indicates sustained demand and future growth potential, especially with cross-selling opportunities within the Apple ecosystem. Considering previous sentiment, there appears to be a balance between whether beat earning is enough to offset negative information such as iPhone decline, with most leaning towards rise. However, some were more pessimistic, highlighting supplier issues, which proved to have some negative impact. This specific news, combined with previous opinions, it still suggests higher probability of stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, the decline in iPhone sales is a significant concern, as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The initial market reaction was positive (stock rose in extended trading), suggesting investors prioritized the earnings beat. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales is uncertain and could negatively affect investor sentiment.  The previous predictions are varied, with some emphasizing the positive earnings beat and others highlighting the iPhone sales decline.  Considering the mixed nature of the news and the divergence of opinions among the previous models, a moderately positive outlook is favored, but with a significant chance of price fluctuation. The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the initial market reaction and the exceeding of earnings expectations, but the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales keeps the probability of a fall relatively high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. The mixed sentiment from previous predictions shows a balance between optimism about earnings growth and caution regarding iPhone demand. Given the overall positive earnings outlook but uncertainty around iPhone demand, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline suggests that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Apple, forecasts a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price as it implies potential supply chain disruptions or decreased component demand. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong bargaining power might mitigate the direct impact. Considering the indirect nature of the news and Apple's recent performance, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. However, the overall impact is expected to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) as the company continues to find new customers and grow its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion. This growth indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth, especially with opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some emphasizing the positive earnings report and others highlighting concerns such as declining iPhone sales or supply chain issues, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a cautious optimism. However, the direct news provided focuses on the growth of Apple's customer base and potential for further expansion, which is likely to be viewed positively by investors. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, based on this piece of news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential decline in sales for STMicroelectronics, a key supplier to Apple. This might signal possible supply chain constraints for Apple, affecting their ability to produce necessary components. Although Apple has a diversified supply chain, any uncertainty around component availability can cause anxiety among investors. The recent rounds of predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a negative impact and others towards a positive one. Considering the indirect nature of the impact and historical underperformance concerns, the probability of the stock price falling appears slightly higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
