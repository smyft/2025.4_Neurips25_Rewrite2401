This news may negatively impact Apple's stock price as it suggests potential supply chain disruptions or decreased component demand, which could affect Apple's production and sales. However, the direct impact on Apple might be limited as the news is more about STMicroelectronics' forecast and the demand for legacy chips, which may not directly correlate with Apple's current product lineup or future plans. Considering this, there's a slight inclination towards a negative impact but with moderate probabilities due to the indirect nature of the news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
