This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. If iPhone demand meets or exceeds expectations, the stock could rise. If demand disappoints, the stock could fall. Given the mixed sentiment (positive earnings growth but uncertainty around iPhone demand), the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise due to the overall positive earnings outlook.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"All Eyes Are on the iPhone\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
