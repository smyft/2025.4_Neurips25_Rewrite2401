This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests a positive initial response, likely because the beat on earnings was considered more important than the iPhone sales decline by investors at that moment. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales remains uncertain and could weigh on the stock price over time. Therefore, while there's a higher probability of a short-term price rise due to the positive earnings beat, the longer-term outlook is less clear, leading to a higher probability of price fluctuation.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Beats Earnings Target On Services Lift, But iPhone Sales Decline\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
