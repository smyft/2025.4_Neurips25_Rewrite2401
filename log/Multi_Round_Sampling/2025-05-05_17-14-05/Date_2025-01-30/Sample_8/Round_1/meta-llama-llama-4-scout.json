      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\nNews Content: The chip maker\u2014which counts Apple, Samsung Electronics and Tesla among its customers\u2014expects lower sales, as demand for legacy semiconductors remains subdued.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has surpassed earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting that expectations for future growth are dimming. The company has underperformed the market this year, which raises caution among investors. Overall, while the immediate reaction to the earnings surprise could yield a positive response, the negative sentiment in revisions and underperformance weigh heavily on the outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, primarily driven by its Services segment, iPhone sales declined. This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests a positive initial response, likely because the beat on earnings was considered more important than the iPhone sales decline by investors at that moment. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales remains uncertain and could weigh on the stock price over time. Therefore, while there's a higher probability of a short-term price rise due to the positive earnings beat, the longer-term outlook is less clear, leading to a higher probability of price fluctuation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. If iPhone demand meets or exceeds expectations, the stock could rise. If demand disappoints, the stock could fall. Given the mixed sentiment (positive earnings growth but uncertainty around iPhone demand), the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise due to the overall positive earnings outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Apple, Tesla, and Samsung, forecasts a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This news may negatively impact Apple's stock price as it suggests potential supply chain disruptions or decreased component demand, which could affect Apple's production and sales. However, the direct impact on Apple might be limited as the news is more about STMicroelectronics' forecast and the demand for legacy chips, which may not directly correlate with Apple's current product lineup or future plans. Considering this, there's a slight inclination towards a negative impact but with moderate probabilities due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which is a positive indicator for the company's potential for future growth. The fact that Apple is seeing rapid growth in new customers and has opportunities to convince existing iPhone owners to purchase other Apple devices, such as Macs, iPads, or Watches, implies that the company has a strong potential for expanding its revenue streams. This information is likely to be viewed positively by investors, which could lead to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Tesla and Apple, forecasts a decline in sales due to weak demand for legacy chips. This suggests potential supply chain issues affecting both Tesla and Apple. Since Apple relies on chip suppliers like STMicroelectronics, a decrease in their sales volume could imply challenges in obtaining components, potentially impacting Apple's production and shipment timelines. However, considering Apple's diversified supply chain and stronger bargaining power, the direct impact might be limited. Yet, market sentiment may cause investors to reassess their positions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
