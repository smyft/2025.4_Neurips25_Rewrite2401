A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple, with positive earnings guidance boosting investor sentiment, while external factors like Trump's tariff threats create uncertainty. The strong earnings outlook suggests a likelihood of stock price increase, but ongoing tariff concerns could dampen enthusiasm. Given the recent trends in stock futures and Apple's response to recent market turmoil, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, it mentions a \"Dow Jones Dive\" due to Trump's tariff order, which is generally negative for market sentiment and Apple, given its global supply chain. It also notes Apple broke a \"key level,\" which, without further context, is likely a negative indicator in technical analysis, suggesting a potential downtrend. A rising personal consumption and expenditures index usually translates into investors being bearish. However, the headline also notes MicroStrategy making a move along with NVIDIA. The article doesn't explicitly claim Apple also making moves. Considering the tariff order and potential technical breakdown, a negative outlook is slightly more probable. MicroStrategy making moves alongside Nvidia might not be directly tied to Apple's potential. The rising inflation rate also contributes to bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure (due to its hybrid CapEx model),  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily because of concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, which is seen as being negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending.  The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of it staying the same or falling slightly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth guidance are typically bullish signals for a stock, as they indicate the company is performing well and has a positive outlook. This is likely to instill confidence in investors and could lead to increased buying activity. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on global tech stocks, including Apple's competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia. While Apple's earnings report is upcoming, the news does not directly mention Apple's AI capabilities or financial performance. However, the overall tech stock sell-off led by DeepSeek's emergence could potentially affect Apple's stock. Given that the news does not provide specific information that would negatively impact Apple directly, and considering that Apple's earnings report is expected soon, which could potentially be positive, the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a positive or neutral outcome for Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple's Fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Given that the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are also up, it indicates a generally positive market sentiment, which could further support a potential increase in Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential threat to major tech companies like Nvidia, Amazon.com, and Alphabet posed by a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. Despite concerns raised on Wall Street, the article suggests these concerns might be overblown. Since Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned as one of the 'vulnerable' companies, the impact on its stock price could be minimal. However, general market sentiment might still affect Apple's stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
