      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: How Apple can 'leverage' Big Tech players' AI spending\nNews Content: Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to examine Apple's (AAPL) earnings print, analyzing what the results signal about a possible iPhone upgrade cycle and where Apple stands in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\n\"If we've learned anything from the last two quarters, September and December, from Apple, it's that mismatch in the timing of the hardware rollout ... and the software rollout ... has weighed on iPhone sales,\" Forte says.\n\nHe explains his Hold rating on Apple stock, noting, \"It isn't clear to me yet that we're going to get this super-cycle, or much less an upgrade cycle from AI.\"\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek negatively impacted several Big Tech names, such as Nvidia (NVDA). Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple, with positive earnings guidance boosting investor sentiment, while external factors like Trump's tariff threats create uncertainty. The strong earnings outlook suggests a likelihood of stock price increase, but ongoing tariff concerns could dampen enthusiasm. Given the recent trends in stock futures and Apple's response to recent market turmoil, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, it mentions a \"Dow Jones Dive\" due to Trump's tariff order, which is generally negative for market sentiment and Apple, given its global supply chain. It also notes Apple broke a \"key level,\" which, without further context, is likely a negative indicator in technical analysis, suggesting a potential downtrend. A rising personal consumption and expenditures index usually translates into investors being bearish. However, the headline also notes MicroStrategy making a move along with NVIDIA. The article doesn't explicitly claim Apple also making moves. Considering the tariff order and potential technical breakdown, a negative outlook is slightly more probable. MicroStrategy making moves alongside Nvidia might not be directly tied to Apple's potential. The rising inflation rate also contributes to bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure (due to its hybrid CapEx model),  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily because of concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, which is seen as being negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending.  The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of it staying the same or falling slightly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth guidance are typically bullish signals for a stock, as they indicate the company is performing well and has a positive outlook. This is likely to instill confidence in investors and could lead to increased buying activity. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on global tech stocks, including Apple's competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia. While Apple's earnings report is upcoming, the news does not directly mention Apple's AI capabilities or financial performance. However, the overall tech stock sell-off led by DeepSeek's emergence could potentially affect Apple's stock. Given that the news does not provide specific information that would negatively impact Apple directly, and considering that Apple's earnings report is expected soon, which could potentially be positive, the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a positive or neutral outcome for Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple's Fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Given that the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are also up, it indicates a generally positive market sentiment, which could further support a potential increase in Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential threat to major tech companies like Nvidia, Amazon.com, and Alphabet posed by a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. Despite concerns raised on Wall Street, the article suggests these concerns might be overblown. Since Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned as one of the 'vulnerable' companies, the impact on its stock price could be minimal. However, general market sentiment might still affect Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The recent news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. Despite the positive guidance for sales growth following the latest earnings report, concerns regarding Trump's tariff threats and their potential impact on inflation and market sentiment add uncertainty. Comparatively, the forecasts suggest an overall bullish outlook due to Apple's recent performance and the resilience shown relative to its competitors. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price increasing than decreasing, albeit with caution due to external factors like tariffs and inflation metrics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The Dow's decline due to Trump's tariffs is a broad negative market influence, potentially dragging Apple down. Breaking a 'key level' is also usually a negative technical signal. The rising personal consumption and expenditures index may fuel investors being further bearish, adding to the downward pressure. However the move from Microstrategy might provide positive sentiment for the broader market, which in turn also impact the Apple stock. I am also observing that the previous rounds include a diverse set of predictions, some being very positive, while others are very negative on the stock. The distribution is wide, suggesting that the general trend is unclear. Since I am observing some uncertainty in the predictions of other models, I am going to assign similar probabilities of price rising and falling. I will give a slight edge to the price falling given the slightly bearish overall sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure due to its hybrid CapEx model, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending. The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook.  Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.85 probability of a price increase, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the impact of the news. Considering the mixed signals and the analyst's cautious outlook, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining relatively stable or experiencing a minor decline, rather than a significant increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news related directly to Apple's performance tips the balance slightly towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance, which are typically bullish signals for a stock. Previous predictions from models like 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324' and 'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct' strongly support a positive outlook with high probabilities of stock price rise (0.85 and 0.8 respectively), citing strong earnings and positive market sentiment. However, models like 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001' and 'google/gemini-flash-1.5' present a more cautious view, citing external factors like tariffs and concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle. Given the predominance of positive earnings news and the weight of previous bullish predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, though not without some consideration of external risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Additionally, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up, indicating a generally positive market sentiment, which could further support a potential increase in Apple's stock price. Considering the predictions from other models, there is a trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models having a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, some models also mention potential risks and uncertainties, which could affect the stock price. Taking into account the overall positive sentiment and the trend of others' predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential threat to tech giants such as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, citing a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. However, Apple is not directly mentioned as being at risk. Furthermore, previous predictions suggest a varied mix of opinions. Models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-4-scout predict a higher probability of the stock price rising. On the other hand, google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 predicts a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering these varied forecasts and the fact that Apple is not specifically highlighted as being at risk by DeepSeek, a balanced approach suggests a moderate probability of the stock price rising.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with positive earnings guidance suggesting growth momentum, particularly in iPhone sales. However, external concerns like President Trump's tariff threats and rising inflation metrics introduce significant uncertainty, which could dampen investor sentiment. While Apple's strong earnings report supports a bullish viewpoint, external factors and the mixed predictions from previous analyses necessitate a balanced approach. Thus, after considering the positive earnings outlook and external risks, I estimate that there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling, but with caution due to external pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline presents mixed signals for Apple. The Dow's decline due to potential tariffs and the breaking of a 'key level' are bearish indicators. The rise in the personal Consumption and Expenditures (PCE) index also introduces another bearish sentiment due to rising inflation. However, MicroStrategy making moves alongside Nvidia may have a positive impact for the broader technology sector. Considering the previous predictions, there's a lack of clear consensus. The predictions range from very bullish to very bearish, reflecting the uncertainty in the market or potential hidden information. The shift this round from a generally mixed stance to a more bearish stance in some models suggests that the tariff concerns and inflationary pressures might be gaining more weight in the analysis. Considering the mixed signals but the trend toward concerns about inflation and the tariff order, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure (due to its hybrid CapEx model), he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending. The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook.  Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.85 probability of a price increase, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the impact of the news.  Considering the mixed signals and the analyst's cautious outlook, and the wide range of previous predictions, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining relatively stable, with a slightly higher chance of a minor decline than a significant increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news related directly to Apple's performance tips the balance slightly towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after posting better-than-expected earnings and providing solid growth guidance, which are strong positive signals for investor sentiment. Previous predictions from models like 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324' and 'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct' strongly support a bullish outlook with high probabilities of stock price rise (0.85 and 0.8 respectively). While some models like 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001' and 'google/gemini-flash-1.5' present a more cautious view due to external factors like tariffs and concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, the overall trend in predictions leans towards a positive outcome. Given the predominance of positive earnings news and the weight of previous bullish predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, though some consideration of external risks is warranted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news discusses the impact of a Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, on global tech stocks, but does not directly mention Apple's performance or outlook. However, it is noted that Apple is expected to release its fiscal first quarter results. Previous predictions from various models show a wide range of probabilities for Apple's stock price movement, reflecting uncertainty. Some models emphasize the potential positive impact of Apple's upcoming earnings report, while others consider external factors like tariffs and market sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the absence of directly negative news about Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple's Fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Additionally, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up, indicating a generally positive market sentiment, which could further support a potential increase in Apple's stock price. Considering the predictions from other models, there is a trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models having a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, some models also mention potential risks and uncertainties, which could affect the stock price. Taking into account the overall positive sentiment and the trend of others' predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential threat to tech giants such as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, citing a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. However, Apple is not directly mentioned as being at risk. Furthermore, previous predictions suggest a varied mix of opinions. Models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-4-scout predict a higher probability of the stock price rising. On the other hand, google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 predicts a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering these varied forecasts and the fact that Apple is not specifically highlighted as being at risk by DeepSeek, a balanced approach suggests a moderate probability of the stock price rising.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. Despite a positive earnings report with guidance indicating growth in sales, external factors such as President Trump's tariff threats and potential inflation pressures introduce significant uncertainty. Though the strong earnings and outlook for the iPhone could boost investor sentiment, the rising inflation and potential implications of tariffs may temper enthusiasm. Given the varied predictions from other models and the overall market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with caution due to the external factors at play.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The negative aspects include the Dow Jones's dive due to potential tariffs imposed by Trump, Apple breaking a key level (presumably a support level), and the rise in the Personal Consumption and Expenditures (PCE) index indicating rising inflation. All of these are bearish signals. However, MicroStrategy making a move, possibly an investment, could be a positive sign for the tech sector, though its direct impact on Apple is less certain. Looking at the trend of previous predictions, there has been a shift from a more bullish stance towards a more cautious or bearish one, particularly in Google's models. Models that focus on the positive aspects of previous earning results remain somewhat bullish. Considering the mix of negative signals in the news and the overall trend towards a more bearish outlook in recent predictions, I am placing a slightly higher probability on the stock price falling. However, I will note that there could be positive sentiment among the market given MicroStrategy's move.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure due to its hybrid CapEx model, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock.  Concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts, overshadow the positive AI aspect. The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' further dampens the outlook.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting uncertainty.  The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but the lack of strong positive news specific to Apple and the presence of significant concerns mean a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more probable. I've weighted the previous predictions to give more weight to those that seem to focus most on this specific news, while also acknowledging the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after posting better-than-expected earnings and providing solid growth guidance, which are strong positive signals for investor sentiment. Previous predictions from models like 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324' and 'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct' strongly support a bullish outlook with high probabilities of stock price rise (0.85 and 0.8 respectively).
