(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple, with positive earnings guidance boosting investor sentiment, while external factors like Trump's tariff threats create uncertainty. The strong earnings outlook suggests a likelihood of stock price increase, but ongoing tariff concerns could dampen enthusiasm. Given the recent trends in stock futures and Apple's response to recent market turmoil, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, it mentions a \"Dow Jones Dive\" due to Trump's tariff order, which is generally negative for market sentiment and Apple, given its global supply chain. It also notes Apple broke a \"key level,\" which, without further context, is likely a negative indicator in technical analysis, suggesting a potential downtrend. A rising personal consumption and expenditures index usually translates into investors being bearish. However, the headline also notes MicroStrategy making a move along with NVIDIA. The article doesn't explicitly claim Apple also making moves. Considering the tariff order and potential technical breakdown, a negative outlook is slightly more probable. MicroStrategy making moves alongside Nvidia might not be directly tied to Apple's potential. The rising inflation rate also contributes to bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure (due to its hybrid CapEx model),  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily because of concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, which is seen as being negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending.  The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of it staying the same or falling slightly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth guidance are typically bullish signals for a stock, as they indicate the company is performing well and has a positive outlook. This is likely to instill confidence in investors and could lead to increased buying activity. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on global tech stocks, including Apple's competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia. While Apple's earnings report is upcoming, the news does not directly mention Apple's AI capabilities or financial performance. However, the overall tech stock sell-off led by DeepSeek's emergence could potentially affect Apple's stock. Given that the news does not provide specific information that would negatively impact Apple directly, and considering that Apple's earnings report is expected soon, which could potentially be positive, the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a positive or neutral outcome for Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple's Fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Given that the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are also up, it indicates a generally positive market sentiment, which could further support a potential increase in Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential threat to major tech companies like Nvidia, Amazon.com, and Alphabet posed by a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. Despite concerns raised on Wall Street, the article suggests these concerns might be overblown. Since Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned as one of the 'vulnerable' companies, the impact on its stock price could be minimal. However, general market sentiment might still affect Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The recent news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. Despite the positive guidance for sales growth following the latest earnings report, concerns regarding Trump's tariff threats and their potential impact on inflation and market sentiment add uncertainty. Comparatively, the forecasts suggest an overall bullish outlook due to Apple's recent performance and the resilience shown relative to its competitors. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price increasing than decreasing, albeit with caution due to external factors like tariffs and inflation metrics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The Dow's decline due to Trump's tariffs is a broad negative market influence, potentially dragging Apple down. Breaking a 'key level' is also usually a negative technical signal. The rising personal consumption and expenditures index may fuel investors being further bearish, adding to the downward pressure. However the move from Microstrategy might provide positive sentiment for the broader market, which in turn also impact the Apple stock. I am also observing that the previous rounds include a diverse set of predictions, some being very positive, while others are very negative on the stock. The distribution is wide, suggesting that the general trend is unclear. Since I am observing some uncertainty in the predictions of other models, I am going to assign similar probabilities of price rising and falling. I will give a slight edge to the price falling given the slightly bearish overall sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure due to its hybrid CapEx model, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending. The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook.  Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.85 probability of a price increase, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the impact of the news. Considering the mixed signals and the analyst's cautious outlook, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining relatively stable or experiencing a minor decline, rather than a significant increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news related directly to Apple's performance tips the balance slightly towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance, which are typically bullish signals for a stock. Previous predictions from models like 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324' and 'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct' strongly support a positive outlook with high probabilities of stock price rise (0.85 and 0.8 respectively), citing strong earnings and positive market sentiment. However, models like 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001' and 'google/gemini-flash-1.5' present a more cautious view, citing external factors like tariffs and concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle. Given the predominance of positive earnings news and the weight of previous bullish predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, though not without some consideration of external risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Additionally, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are up, indicating a generally positive market sentiment, which could further support a potential increase in Apple's stock price. Considering the predictions from other models, there is a trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models having a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, some models also mention potential risks and uncertainties, which could affect the stock price. Taking into account the overall positive sentiment and the trend of others' predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential threat to tech giants such as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, citing a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. However, Apple is not directly mentioned as being at risk. Furthermore, previous predictions suggest a varied mix of opinions. Models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-4-scout predict a higher probability of the stock price rising. On the other hand, google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 predicts a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering these varied forecasts and the fact that Apple is not specifically highlighted as being at risk by DeepSeek, a balanced approach suggests a moderate probability of the stock price rising.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
