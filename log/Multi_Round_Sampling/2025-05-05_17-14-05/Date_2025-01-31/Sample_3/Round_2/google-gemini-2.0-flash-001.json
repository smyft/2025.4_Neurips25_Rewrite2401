(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding Apple's performance in comparison to other tech giants in the Mag 7, particularly focusing on challenges in the Chinese market and increased competition. While Apple reported positive earnings growth of 7.1% with improving margins, concerns about demand in China and AI capabilities weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the earnings season has shown a generally positive trend for tech stocks, yet market skepticism remains around heavy investments in AI without clear monetization strategies. Given these factors, it's likely that the stock price has a moderate chance of rising due to earnings beats, but also a significant chance of falling due to ongoing competitive pressures and market uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's perceived lack of innovation in AI compared to other companies actively involved in AI development. An analyst downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, further contributes to negative sentiment. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it's lagging behind in generative AI applications for consumers. The article, while including Apple in a list of AI stocks, ultimately favors other AI stocks for potentially higher returns. The inclusion of Apple second place is moderately offsetting, however, the analyst downgrade will most likely have a significantly negative effect. The discussion around the Stargate initiative has limited direct relevance to AAPL. Therefore, the overwhelmingly negative tone suggests a higher probability of the stock price declining.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains.  However, the news content is incomplete due to a paywall.  Without access to the full article, we cannot assess the specific factors driving this increase, nor can we determine if Apple is experiencing above-average growth within the sector.  Therefore, we must make a cautious prediction. A positive sector trend generally suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price rise for companies within that sector; however, other company-specific factors could negate this.  We assign a moderate probability to a price rise, reflecting the limited information available and the inherent volatility of stock prices.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that the tech sector, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), is gaining, which generally reflects positive sentiment in the tech industry. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to benefit from this broader market movement. Given the positive trend in tech stocks, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is generally a positive signal for the company's stock price. The overall market trend, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%, also suggests a positive environment. Given that the news specifically highlights Apple's strong performance, it is likely that the stock price will rise. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports a positive premarket increase of 3.5% in Apple's stock price following the release of its quarterly results. The company's revenue and earnings per share exceeded analyst projections, driven by a significant increase in the services division. Although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the company's outlook for future sales growth is positive. The stock's ability to protect itself during recent market volatility and its cautious approach to AI investments are also viewed positively. Based on these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, with a notable highlight being the strong performance of its services revenue. Despite potential mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat on analyst estimates is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, as services revenue is a significant growth area for the company. Therefore, the general market reaction is expected to be favorable.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed view of Apple's performance relative to its competitors in the tech sector. While Apple reported a modest increase in earnings and healthy net margins, concerns about demand in China and competition from local players, as well as skepticism about investment in AI, weigh heavily on investor sentiment. These factors are likely to create uncertainty about future growth and competitive positioning. However, Apple's status as a major player in the tech sector, combined with positive results compared to the general market trend, suggests a higher likelihood of maintaining its stock price. Given these competing dynamics, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced but slightly favor a rise due to the favorable earnings and market reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article paints a concerning picture for Apple's AI prospects. While Apple has launched Apple Intelligence, analysts downgrade the stock citing a lack of AI innovation, slower iPhone growth, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst emphasizes that Apple's gradual rollout of its AI and the advancements of competitors make it difficult for Apple to outperform, and also states there's little upside to Apple's valuation due to uncertainty in Gen AI. The article does rank AAPL 2nd on the list of AI stocks listed in news, but emphasizes other AI stocks are more promising due to higher returns and shorter investment timeframes. Considering the analyst downgrade and concerns about AI, the probability of the stock falling is higher. The previous round has a range of beliefs, from 0.3 to 0.8 for rising, with an emphasis from some model believing that Apple won't gain the benefit from AI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The provided news headline is positive, indicating a general upward trend in the tech sector.  However, the lack of detail due to the paywall prevents a precise assessment of Apple's specific performance within that trend.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from a 0.3 probability of rising to 0.8.  The higher predictions cite factors such as better-than-expected earnings and strong services revenue. Lower predictions emphasize concerns about AI competition and the Chinese market.  Considering the positive sector trend and the mostly positive sentiment from previous predictions, coupled with the incompleteness of the provided news article, a cautious optimism is warranted.  A moderately high probability of a price rise reflects this analysis.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector, it is likely to benefit from this broader market movement. Previous predictions from other models also suggest a generally positive sentiment towards Apple's stock, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Factors such as strong earnings performance, positive sector trends, and investor confidence in tech stocks support this outlook. However, the lack of detailed news content due to the paywall introduces some uncertainty, which slightly tempers the probability of a rise. Overall, the positive sector trend and Apple's established market position suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is generally a positive signal for the company's stock price. The overall market trend, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%, also suggests a positive environment. Although previous predictions vary, several models suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive earnings reports and strong performance in services revenue. However, concerns about demand in China and AI capabilities weigh on investor sentiment. Considering these factors, it's likely that the stock price has a moderate to high chance of rising due to earnings beats, but also a significant chance of falling due to ongoing competitive pressures and market uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article reports a positive premarket increase of 3.5% in Apple's stock price following the release of its quarterly results, with revenue and earnings per share exceeding analyst projections. The services division showed a significant increase, and although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the company's outlook for future sales growth is positive. Considering the overall positive trend, the cautious approach to AI investments, and the stock's ability to protect itself during recent market volatility, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
