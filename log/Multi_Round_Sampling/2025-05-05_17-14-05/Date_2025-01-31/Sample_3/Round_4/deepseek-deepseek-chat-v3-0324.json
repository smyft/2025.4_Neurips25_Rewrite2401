A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding Apple's performance in comparison to other tech giants in the Mag 7, particularly focusing on challenges in the Chinese market and increased competition. While Apple reported positive earnings growth of 7.1% with improving margins, concerns about demand in China and AI capabilities weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the earnings season has shown a generally positive trend for tech stocks, yet market skepticism remains around heavy investments in AI without clear monetization strategies. Given these factors, it's likely that the stock price has a moderate chance of rising due to earnings beats, but also a significant chance of falling due to ongoing competitive pressures and market uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's perceived lack of innovation in AI compared to other companies actively involved in AI development. An analyst downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, further contributes to negative sentiment. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it's lagging behind in generative AI applications for consumers. The article, while including Apple in a list of AI stocks, ultimately favors other AI stocks for potentially higher returns. The inclusion of Apple second place is moderately offsetting, however, the analyst downgrade will most likely have a significantly negative effect. The discussion around the Stargate initiative has limited direct relevance to AAPL. Therefore, the overwhelmingly negative tone suggests a higher probability of the stock price declining.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains.  However, the news content is incomplete due to a paywall.  Without access to the full article, we cannot assess the specific factors driving this increase, nor can we determine if Apple is experiencing above-average growth within the sector.  Therefore, we must make a cautious prediction. A positive sector trend generally suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price rise for companies within that sector; however, other company-specific factors could negate this.  We assign a moderate probability to a price rise, reflecting the limited information available and the inherent volatility of stock prices.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that the tech sector, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), is gaining, which generally reflects positive sentiment in the tech industry. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to benefit from this broader market movement. Given the positive trend in tech stocks, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is generally a positive signal for the company's stock price. The overall market trend, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%, also suggests a positive environment. Given that the news specifically highlights Apple's strong performance, it is likely that the stock price will rise. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports a positive premarket increase of 3.5% in Apple's stock price following the release of its quarterly results. The company's revenue and earnings per share exceeded analyst projections, driven by a significant increase in the services division. Although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the company's outlook for future sales growth is positive. The stock's ability to protect itself during recent market volatility and its cautious approach to AI investments are also viewed positively. Based on these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, with a notable highlight being the strong performance of its services revenue. Despite potential mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat on analyst estimates is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, as services revenue is a significant growth area for the company. Therefore, the general market reaction is expected to be favorable.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed view of Apple's performance relative to its competitors in the tech sector. While Apple reported a modest increase in earnings and healthy net margins, concerns about demand in China and competition from local players, as well as skepticism about investment in AI, weigh heavily on investor sentiment. These factors are likely to create uncertainty about future growth and competitive positioning. However, Apple's status as a major player in the tech sector, combined with positive results compared to the general market trend, suggests a higher likelihood of maintaining its stock price. Given these competing dynamics, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced but slightly favor a rise due to the favorable earnings and market reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article paints a concerning picture for Apple's AI prospects. While Apple has launched Apple Intelligence, analysts downgrade the stock citing a lack of AI innovation, slower iPhone growth, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst emphasizes that Apple's gradual rollout of its AI and the advancements of competitors make it difficult for Apple to outperform, and also states there's little upside to Apple's valuation due to uncertainty in Gen AI. The article does rank AAPL 2nd on the list of AI stocks listed in news, but emphasizes other AI stocks are more promising due to higher returns and shorter investment timeframes. Considering the analyst downgrade and concerns about AI, the probability of the stock falling is higher. The previous round has a range of beliefs, from 0.3 to 0.8 for rising, with an emphasis from some model believing that Apple won't gain the benefit from AI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The provided news headline is positive, indicating a general upward trend in the tech sector.  However, the lack of detail due to the paywall prevents a precise assessment of Apple's specific performance within that trend.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from a 0.3 probability of rising to 0.8.  The higher predictions cite factors such as better-than-expected earnings and strong services revenue. Lower predictions emphasize concerns about AI competition and the Chinese market.  Considering the positive sector trend and the mostly positive sentiment from previous predictions, coupled with the incompleteness of the provided news article, a cautious optimism is warranted.  A moderately high probability of a price rise reflects this analysis.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector, it is likely to benefit from this broader market movement. Previous predictions from other models also suggest a generally positive sentiment towards Apple's stock, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Factors such as strong earnings performance, positive sector trends, and investor confidence in tech stocks support this outlook. However, the lack of detailed news content due to the paywall introduces some uncertainty, which slightly tempers the probability of a rise. Overall, the positive sector trend and Apple's established market position suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is generally a positive signal for the company's stock price. The overall market trend, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%, also suggests a positive environment. Although previous predictions vary, several models suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive earnings reports and strong performance in services revenue. However, concerns about demand in China and AI capabilities weigh on investor sentiment. Considering these factors, it's likely that the stock price has a moderate to high chance of rising due to earnings beats, but also a significant chance of falling due to ongoing competitive pressures and market uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article reports a positive premarket increase of 3.5% in Apple's stock price following the release of its quarterly results, with revenue and earnings per share exceeding analyst projections. The services division showed a significant increase, and although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the company's outlook for future sales growth is positive. Considering the overall positive trend, the cautious approach to AI investments, and the stock's ability to protect itself during recent market volatility, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed perspective on Apple Inc.'s performance relative to its competitors in the tech sector, highlighting both positive earnings growth and concerns regarding competition in China and AI. While Apple's earnings were up 7.1% on 4% higher revenues, the ongoing challenges in the Chinese market and local competition create a cloud of uncertainty. Despite these headwinds, the overall positive trend in the tech sector, along with Apple's historical strength and market presence, supports the probability of the stock price rising. Yet, significant caution remains due to competitive pressures and market skepticism. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability for a price rise, balanced against notable risks that may lead to a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's perceived weakness in AI innovation, highlighted by an analyst downgrade. Concerns about slower iPhone growth and challenges in the Chinese market further contribute to negative sentiment. Although Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it lags behind competitors in generative AI. The article mentions Apple is ranked 2nd on a list but also suggests other AI stocks are more promising. Elon Musk's Stargate dispute doesn't have strong direct impact on Apple. Previous predictions are varied, but some models emphasized less belief that Apple will gain benefit from AI. Considering the analyst downgrade, AI innovation concerns and the generally negative sentiment, the probability of stock price falling is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news is limited, only stating that the tech sector is experiencing gains.  This positive sector trend suggests a higher likelihood of Apple (AAPL) also seeing a rise in its stock price. However, the lack of specific information about Apple's performance prevents a definitive conclusion. Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting differing interpretations of Apple's recent financial results and its position in the AI market. Some models emphasize positive earnings and sector trends, while others highlight concerns about AI competition and the Chinese market. The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the significant spread suggests considerable uncertainty.  Considering the incomplete news and the divergence of opinions in previous predictions, a cautious approach is best. I will weight the probabilities to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly toward a rise based on the positive sector news but acknowledging that this might not translate to AAPL specifically.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major component of the tech sector, is likely to benefit from this broader market movement. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive earnings reports and strong performance in services revenue. However, concerns about demand in China and AI capabilities introduce some uncertainty. Given the positive sector trend and Apple's established market position, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately high, though tempered by these concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive signal for the company's stock price. However, concerns about demand in China, AI capabilities, and competition from local players weigh on investor sentiment. Given the mixed view of Apple's performance relative to its competitors and the positive results compared to analyst projections, it's likely that the stock price has a moderate chance of rising. The overall market trend, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%, also suggests a positive environment for tech stocks. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling, but not significantly so due to the ongoing competitive pressures and market uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article reports a positive premarket increase of 3.5% in Apple's stock price following the release of its quarterly results. The company's revenue and earnings per share exceeded analyst projections, driven by a significant increase in the services division. Although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the company's outlook for future sales growth is positive. Considering the overall positive trend, the cautious approach to AI investments, and the stock's ability to protect itself during recent market volatility, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling. The previous predictions from other models also suggest a generally positive sentiment towards Apple's stock, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting positive earnings growth but also significant concerns regarding competition in the Chinese market and ongoing challenges with AI capabilities. Recent earnings results show a modest increase in revenues and net margins, which could generally support the stock price rising. However, the sentiment surrounding AI innovation and the comparative advantages perceived by other tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet introduces caution among investors. While the overall tech sector shows a positive trend, including favorable market responses to earnings reports from other 'Mag 7' companies, ongoing uncertainties highlight a risk for AAPL. Given the mixed signals\u2014better-than-expected earnings juxtaposed with competitive pressures\u2014I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising against a backdrop of notable risks that may lead to a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Apple's struggle with AI innovation compared to other companies. The analyst downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales outlook, AI innovation shortage, and issues within the Chinese market, suggests a negative sentiment. Furthermore, while Apple introduced 'Apple Intelligence,' it's seen as lagging behind other AI applications. The discussion regarding the Stargate project does not significantly influence Apple's stock. Prior predictions have diverged indicating uncertainty, although most point towards a slightly higher likelihood of price increase from earlier economic gains. Recent rounds show that those predictions are converging more tightly around a price decrease. Given the focus on AI shortcomings and analyst downgrades, the stock is more likely to decline. Considering previously round information, I give a high weight on its effect.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news is limited, only stating a general positive trend in the tech sector. This positive sector trend suggests a higher likelihood of Apple (AAPL) also seeing a stock price rise. However, the lack of specific information about Apple's performance, coupled with the paywall preventing access to detailed news, necessitates a cautious approach. Analyzing previous predictions reveals a wide range of probabilities, reflecting differing interpretations of Apple's financial standing and AI market position. Some models emphasize positive earnings and sector trends, while others highlight AI competition and Chinese market challenges.  The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the significant spread in previous predictions highlights considerable uncertainty.  Therefore, the prediction leans slightly toward a rise, acknowledging that the positive sector news might not directly translate to AAPL's stock price. The lack of concrete company-specific information heavily influences this conservative estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major component of the tech sector, is likely to benefit from this broader market movement.
