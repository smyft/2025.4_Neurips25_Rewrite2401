(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The positive revenue forecast provided by Apple, despite mixed holiday results, has reassured investors and resulted in a significant after-hours stock price increase of over 3%. The overall revenue growth of 4% surpassed analyst expectations, and a strong performance in the services segment contributed positively. However, concerns about declining iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market could dampen investor enthusiasm, which introduces some uncertainty. Given that the forecast aligns with analyst predictions, a higher probability of stock price increase is expected, though the potential for further declines remains moderate due to existing challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7. Here\u2019s What Happens Next\" suggests a negative impact on the 'Mag 7' group of stocks, including Apple. While the article claims that Wall Street's concerns 'might be overblown,' the initial reaction is likely to be negative due to uncertainty around the potential competitive threat from DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. This creates vulnerabilities for companies reliant on existing AI solutions. Apple's reliance on premium pricing and competitive AI creates concerns that may lead to investors re-evaluating current price-to-earning ratio. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a stock price fall, at least in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position within Warren Buffett's portfolio and its long-term holding by Berkshire Hathaway. While this is generally positive, the article also highlights several potentially negative factors.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, citing macroeconomic challenges and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple intelligence features, suggests a potential negative impact on Apple's short-term performance.  Conversely, the fact that Buffett is a long-term holder of Apple, despite his generally more cautious investment approach in 2024, could point to continued confidence in Apple\u2019s long-term prospects. The article's focus is on comparing Apple's performance against other holdings and highlighting AI stocks as potentially better performers, implying a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  Overall, the news is mixed and doesn't provide strong directional signals.  While the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong, short-term concerns warrant a more cautious assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has canceled its project to build augmented reality glasses, which was seen as a potential next big product following the mixed reception of the Apple Vision Pro. This signals a setback in Apple's innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are advancing. The cancellation may lead to concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings. However, the Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, and Apple continues to work on successors and other concepts like AR-enabled AirPods. The negative sentiment from the project cancellation might outweigh the positive aspects in the short term, potentially leading to a slight decline in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's mixed holiday results, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter that aligns with analyst predictions. Despite declines in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement, indicating initial investor optimism. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. The forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth seems to have soothed investor nerves, but the overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results' indicates a mixed quarterly report from Apple Inc. Despite declines in iPhone sales and revenue from China, the company's revenue forecast for the current quarter and growth in services revenue have reassured investors. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. However, the company still faces challenges in China, AI development, and regulatory scrutiny. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the positive forecast and services revenue growth may outweigh the negative factors in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth. This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc.'s reassuring revenue forecast has positively impacted investor sentiment, leading to a stock price increase of over 3% in late trading. While the mixed holiday results include declines in iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, the forecast aligns with analyst expectations, suggesting that investors feel more comfortable with the company's short-term outlook. However, concerns surrounding competitive pressures, particularly in AI, and inventory issues in China still pose risks. Overall, the positive revenue forecast and growth in services revenue outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher estimated probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a potential negative impact on Apple and other 'Mag 7' companies due to a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. The article attempts to downplay the concerns but the initial market reaction is likely to be cautious. Considering previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions. Some models focused on Apple's positive forecasts and past performance while others highlighted the AI threat and competitive pressures. Round 0 predictions reveal that initially, some models leaned towards a stock price increase based on revenue forecasts, while others predicted a decrease due to AI concerns. Given the news is specifically about AI competition and potential vulnerabilities, it's likely to create uncertainty and exert downward pressure. The 'cheaper AI' narrative might lead investors to reassess valuations, especially considering Apple's premium pricing strategy. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling because the AI competition is a fresh concern that the market hasn't fully priced in yet.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's inclusion in Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which is generally positive. However, the article also presents conflicting information.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features suggest potential short-term negative impacts.  Conversely, Buffett's continued long-term investment in Apple despite his cautious stance in 2024 suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.  The overall sentiment is mixed, with several factors arguing for both price increases and decreases.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others predicting a fall. Given this uncertainty and the mixed signals in the news, a neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the weight of Buffett's continued investment.  The lack of strong directional signals from this particular news item weighs heavily in a neutral probability assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides. This cancellation may raise concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings. While the Vision Pro remains a technical marvel and Apple continues to work on other concepts like AR-enabled AirPods, the negative sentiment from the project cancellation is likely to outweigh the positive aspects in the short term. Additionally, the article mentions internal morale issues within the Vision Products Group and past failures like the self-driving car project, which could further dampen investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates a mixed performance with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which has helped boost the stock price. Despite declines in iPhone sales and revenue from China, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The positive forecast and services revenue growth have outweighed the negative factors, leading to an initial stock price increase of over 3%. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but with caution due to existing challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's mixed holiday results, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter that aligns with analyst predictions. Despite declines in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected.

This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects. While there are some concerns about declining iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, the overall sentiment from the earnings report and guidance is optimistic, supported by initial market reactions. Previous predictions from models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct also suggest cautious optimism, supporting a high probability of stock price increase.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent financial results show mixed performance, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter that aligns with analyst expectations. This has provided some optimism to investors, leading to a stock price increase of over 3% during after-hours trading. While there are significant challenges, particularly in the Chinese market and declining iPhone sales, the overall growth in services and better-than-expected performance in other product lines such as Mac and iPad help mitigate some concerns. However, worries regarding competition in AI and regulatory issues remain. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of it falling, reflecting cautious optimism in the investor sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7. Here\u2019s What Happens Next\" suggests a potential negative impact on Apple, although the article argues that concerns might be overblown. The key concern is the emergence of a cheaper AI model and its potential to disrupt the competitive landscape. Considering the previous predictions, opinions are divided, with some models focusing on Apple's positive revenue forecasts and strong past performance, increasing its stock price while others emphasize the AI threat, AR/VR project cancellation and associated risks. The trend seems to be a slight decrease in the probability of the stock rising as the potential negative impact of the AI competition gains more weight. Given this uncertainty, and acknowledging that the market may not have fully priced in the potential competitive threat from DeepSeek's AI, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. Though the article attempts to mitigate concerns, the uncertainty caused by AI competition and potential vulnerability is a strong enough factor to believe it will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Apple's inclusion in Warren Buffett's long-term holdings, which is generally positive for investor sentiment.  However, the article also presents conflicting information.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features suggest potential short-term negative impacts on the stock price.  Conversely, Buffett's continued long-term investment suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, suggesting uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news.  While the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong due to Buffett's continued investment, the short-term outlook is more uncertain due to the conflicting information presented in the article and the differing views of various prediction models. I am leaning slightly towards a higher probability of price increase due to the weight given to Buffett's long term investment and the company's consistent revenue growth. However, the risk factors should not be overlooked.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides.
