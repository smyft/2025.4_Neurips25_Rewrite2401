(AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The positive revenue forecast provided by Apple, despite mixed holiday results, has reassured investors and resulted in a significant after-hours stock price increase of over 3%. The overall revenue growth of 4% surpassed analyst expectations, and a strong performance in the services segment contributed positively. However, concerns about declining iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market could dampen investor enthusiasm, which introduces some uncertainty. Given that the forecast aligns with analyst predictions, a higher probability of stock price increase is expected, though the potential for further declines remains moderate due to existing challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7. Here\u2019s What Happens Next\" suggests a negative impact on the 'Mag 7' group of stocks, including Apple. While the article claims that Wall Street's concerns 'might be overblown,' the initial reaction is likely to be negative due to uncertainty around the potential competitive threat from DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. This creates vulnerabilities for companies reliant on existing AI solutions. Apple's reliance on premium pricing and competitive AI creates concerns that may lead to investors re-evaluating current price-to-earning ratio. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a stock price fall, at least in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position within Warren Buffett's portfolio and its long-term holding by Berkshire Hathaway. While this is generally positive, the article also highlights several potentially negative factors.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, citing macroeconomic challenges and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple intelligence features, suggests a potential negative impact on Apple's short-term performance.  Conversely, the fact that Buffett is a long-term holder of Apple, despite his generally more cautious investment approach in 2024, could point to continued confidence in Apple\u2019s long-term prospects. The article's focus is on comparing Apple's performance against other holdings and highlighting AI stocks as potentially better performers, implying a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  Overall, the news is mixed and doesn't provide strong directional signals.  While the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong, short-term concerns warrant a more cautious assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has canceled its project to build augmented reality glasses, which was seen as a potential next big product following the mixed reception of the Apple Vision Pro. This signals a setback in Apple's innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are advancing. The cancellation may lead to concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings. However, the Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, and Apple continues to work on successors and other concepts like AR-enabled AirPods. The negative sentiment from the project cancellation might outweigh the positive aspects in the short term, potentially leading to a slight decline in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's mixed holiday results, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter that aligns with analyst predictions. Despite declines in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement, indicating initial investor optimism. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. The forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth seems to have soothed investor nerves, but the overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results' indicates a mixed quarterly report from Apple Inc. Despite declines in iPhone sales and revenue from China, the company's revenue forecast for the current quarter and growth in services revenue have reassured investors. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. However, the company still faces challenges in China, AI development, and regulatory scrutiny. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the positive forecast and services revenue growth may outweigh the negative factors in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth. This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc.'s reassuring revenue forecast has positively impacted investor sentiment, leading to a stock price increase of over 3% in late trading. While the mixed holiday results include declines in iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, the forecast aligns with analyst expectations, suggesting that investors feel more comfortable with the company's short-term outlook. However, concerns surrounding competitive pressures, particularly in AI, and inventory issues in China still pose risks. Overall, the positive revenue forecast and growth in services revenue outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher estimated probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a potential negative impact on Apple and other 'Mag 7' companies due to a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. The article attempts to downplay the concerns but the initial market reaction is likely to be cautious. Considering previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions. Some models focused on Apple's positive forecasts and past performance while others highlighted the AI threat and competitive pressures. Round 0 predictions reveal that initially, some models leaned towards a stock price increase based on revenue forecasts, while others predicted a decrease due to AI concerns. Given the news is specifically about AI competition and potential vulnerabilities, it's likely to create uncertainty and exert downward pressure. The 'cheaper AI' narrative might lead investors to reassess valuations, especially considering Apple's premium pricing strategy. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling because the AI competition is a fresh concern that the market hasn't fully priced in yet.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's inclusion in Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which is generally positive. However, the article also presents conflicting information.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features suggest potential short-term negative impacts.  Conversely, Buffett's continued long-term investment in Apple despite his cautious stance in 2024 suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.  The overall sentiment is mixed, with several factors arguing for both price increases and decreases.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others predicting a fall. Given this uncertainty and the mixed signals in the news, a neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the weight of Buffett's continued investment.  The lack of strong directional signals from this particular news item weighs heavily in a neutral probability assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides. This cancellation may raise concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings. While the Vision Pro remains a technical marvel and Apple continues to work on other concepts like AR-enabled AirPods, the negative sentiment from the project cancellation is likely to outweigh the positive aspects in the short term. Additionally, the article mentions internal morale issues within the Vision Products Group and past failures like the self-driving car project, which could further dampen investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates a mixed performance with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which has helped boost the stock price. Despite declines in iPhone sales and revenue from China, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The positive forecast and services revenue growth have outweighed the negative factors, leading to an initial stock price increase of over 3%. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but with caution due to existing challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's mixed holiday results, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter that aligns with analyst predictions. Despite declines in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement, indicating initial investor optimism. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. Considering the mixed results and the cautious optimism following the forecast, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than that of falling, as the positive forecast and services revenue growth may outweigh the negative factors in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth. This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects. While there are some concerns about declining iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, the overall sentiment from the earnings report and guidance is optimistic, supported by initial market reactions. Previous predictions from models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct also suggest cautious optimism, supporting a high probability of stock price increase.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent financial results show mixed performance, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter that aligns with analyst expectations. This has provided some optimism to investors, leading to a stock price increase of over 3% during after-hours trading. While there are significant challenges, particularly in the Chinese market and declining iPhone sales, the overall growth in services and better-than-expected performance in other product lines such as Mac and iPad help mitigate some concerns. However, worries regarding competition in AI and regulatory issues remain. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of it falling, reflecting cautious optimism in the investor sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7. Here\u2019s What Happens Next\" suggests a potential negative impact on Apple, although the article argues that concerns might be overblown. The key concern is the emergence of a cheaper AI model and its potential to disrupt the competitive landscape. Considering the previous predictions, opinions are divided, with some models focusing on Apple's positive revenue forecasts and strong past performance, increasing its stock price while others emphasize the AI threat, AR/VR project cancellation and associated risks. The trend seems to be a slight decrease in the probability of the stock rising as the potential negative impact of the AI competition gains more weight. Given this uncertainty, and acknowledging that the market may not have fully priced in the potential competitive threat from DeepSeek's AI, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. Though the article attempts to mitigate concerns, the uncertainty caused by AI competition and potential vulnerability is a strong enough factor to believe it will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Apple's inclusion in Warren Buffett's long-term holdings, which is generally positive for investor sentiment.  However, the article also presents conflicting information.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features suggest potential short-term negative impacts on the stock price.  Conversely, Buffett's continued long-term investment suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, suggesting uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news.  While the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong due to Buffett's continued investment, the short-term outlook is more uncertain due to the conflicting information presented in the article and the differing views of various prediction models. I am leaning slightly towards a higher probability of price increase due to the weight given to Buffett's long term investment and the company's consistent revenue growth. However, the risk factors should not be overlooked.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides. This cancellation may raise concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings.

Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. indicates a mixed holiday performance with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter. Despite declines in iPhone sales and revenue from China, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The positive forecast and services revenue growth have outweighed the negative factors, leading to an initial stock price increase of over 3%. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. Considering these factors and the range of predictions from various models, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but with caution due to existing challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's mixed holiday results, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter that aligns with analyst predictions. Despite declines in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement, indicating initial investor optimism.

This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects. While there are some concerns about declining iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, the overall sentiment from the earnings report and guidance is optimistic, supported by initial market reactions. Previous predictions from models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct also suggest cautious optimism, supporting a high probability of stock price increase. However, the mixed signals from different models and some negative factors such as AI competition and potential regulatory issues add some uncertainty.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent financial news presents a mixed picture. While the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast that aligns with analyst expectations, showing 4% overall revenue growth and a strong performance in the services division, there are significant concerns about declining iPhone sales, particularly in China, and heightened competition in the AI sector. The news highlights potential vulnerabilities with newer AI competitors, which could weigh on investor sentiment. The stock initially increased over 3% post-announcement, indicating some positive market reaction. However, with ongoing challenges in China and AI competition, investor optimism is cautious. Overall, considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately higher than that of falling, reflecting the initial positive response but tempered by the underlying challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a potential threat from DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to the 'Mag 7' stocks, including Apple. While the article suggests that Wall Street concerns might be overblown, the initial market reaction is likely to be cautious, as investors reassess the competitive landscape and Apple's vulnerability. Previous predictions show a trend of decreasing confidence in Apple's stock price rising, primarily due to increased concerns about AI competition, AR/VR project cancellation, and potential regulatory issues. Some models still consider Apple's positive revenue forecasts as a mitigating factor, but the overarching sentiment is shifting towards increased uncertainty. Therefore, I will lean towards the fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the fact that Apple is among Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks is positive, suggesting long-term confidence, several counterpoints exist. BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features point to potential short-term headwinds.  The previous predictions show significant divergence, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance. Some models emphasize the positive revenue forecast and Buffett's continued investment, while others highlight concerns about AI competition and the canceled AR glasses project.  Considering the mixed signals, the relatively neutral sentiment from the news itself (it's primarily about Buffett's portfolio and Apple's place within it, not a major new development), and the range of previous predictions, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the long-term positive signal of Buffett's holdings. However, the short-term risks are substantial enough to warrant a significant probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides.
