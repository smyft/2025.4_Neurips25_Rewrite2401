(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The positive revenue forecast provided by Apple, despite mixed holiday results, has reassured investors and resulted in a significant after-hours stock price increase of over 3%. The overall revenue growth of 4% surpassed analyst expectations, and a strong performance in the services segment contributed positively. However, concerns about declining iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market could dampen investor enthusiasm, which introduces some uncertainty. Given that the forecast aligns with analyst predictions, a higher probability of stock price increase is expected, though the potential for further declines remains moderate due to existing challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7. Here\u2019s What Happens Next\" suggests a negative impact on the 'Mag 7' group of stocks, including Apple. While the article claims that Wall Street's concerns 'might be overblown,' the initial reaction is likely to be negative due to uncertainty around the potential competitive threat from DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. This creates vulnerabilities for companies reliant on existing AI solutions. Apple's reliance on premium pricing and competitive AI creates concerns that may lead to investors re-evaluating current price-to-earning ratio. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a stock price fall, at least in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position within Warren Buffett's portfolio and its long-term holding by Berkshire Hathaway. While this is generally positive, the article also highlights several potentially negative factors.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, citing macroeconomic challenges and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple intelligence features, suggests a potential negative impact on Apple's short-term performance.  Conversely, the fact that Buffett is a long-term holder of Apple, despite his generally more cautious investment approach in 2024, could point to continued confidence in Apple\u2019s long-term prospects. The article's focus is on comparing Apple's performance against other holdings and highlighting AI stocks as potentially better performers, implying a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  Overall, the news is mixed and doesn't provide strong directional signals.  While the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong, short-term concerns warrant a more cautious assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has canceled its project to build augmented reality glasses, which was seen as a potential next big product following the mixed reception of the Apple Vision Pro. This signals a setback in Apple's innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are advancing. The cancellation may lead to concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings. However, the Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, and Apple continues to work on successors and other concepts like AR-enabled AirPods. The negative sentiment from the project cancellation might outweigh the positive aspects in the short term, potentially leading to a slight decline in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's mixed holiday results, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter that aligns with analyst predictions. Despite declines in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement, indicating initial investor optimism. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. The forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth seems to have soothed investor nerves, but the overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results' indicates a mixed quarterly report from Apple Inc. Despite declines in iPhone sales and revenue from China, the company's revenue forecast for the current quarter and growth in services revenue have reassured investors. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. However, the company still faces challenges in China, AI development, and regulatory scrutiny. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the positive forecast and services revenue growth may outweigh the negative factors in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth. This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc.'s reassuring revenue forecast has positively impacted investor sentiment, leading to a stock price increase of over 3% in late trading. While the mixed holiday results include declines in iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, the forecast aligns with analyst expectations, suggesting that investors feel more comfortable with the company's short-term outlook. However, concerns surrounding competitive pressures, particularly in AI, and inventory issues in China still pose risks. Overall, the positive revenue forecast and growth in services revenue outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher estimated probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a potential negative impact on Apple and other 'Mag 7' companies due to a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. The article attempts to downplay the concerns but the initial market reaction is likely to be cautious. Considering previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions. Some models focused on Apple's positive forecasts and past performance while others highlighted the AI threat and competitive pressures. Round 0 predictions reveal that initially, some models leaned towards a stock price increase based on revenue forecasts, while others predicted a decrease due to AI concerns. Given the news is specifically about AI competition and potential vulnerabilities, it's likely to create uncertainty and exert downward pressure. The 'cheaper AI' narrative might lead investors to reassess valuations, especially considering Apple's premium pricing strategy. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling because the AI competition is a fresh concern that the market hasn't fully priced in yet.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's inclusion in Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which is generally positive. However, the article also presents conflicting information.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features suggest potential short-term negative impacts.  Conversely, Buffett's continued long-term investment in Apple despite his cautious stance in 2024 suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.  The overall sentiment is mixed, with several factors arguing for both price increases and decreases.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others predicting a fall. Given this uncertainty and the mixed signals in the news, a neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the weight of Buffett's continued investment.  The lack of strong directional signals from this particular news item weighs heavily in a neutral probability assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides. This cancellation may raise concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings. While the Vision Pro remains a technical marvel and Apple continues to work on other concepts like AR-enabled AirPods, the negative sentiment from the project cancellation is likely to outweigh the positive aspects in the short term. Additionally, the article mentions internal morale issues within the Vision Products Group and past failures like the self-driving car project, which could further dampen investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates a mixed performance with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which has helped boost the stock price. Despite declines in iPhone sales and revenue from China, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The positive forecast and services revenue growth have outweighed the negative factors, leading to an initial stock price increase of over 3%. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but with caution due to existing challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's mixed holiday results, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter that aligns with analyst predictions. Despite declines in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement, indicating initial investor optimism. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. Considering the mixed results and the cautious optimism following the forecast, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than that of falling, as the positive forecast and services revenue growth may outweigh the negative factors in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth. This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects. While there are some concerns about declining iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, the overall sentiment from the earnings report and guidance is optimistic, supported by initial market reactions. Previous predictions from models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct also suggest cautious optimism, supporting a high probability of stock price increase.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent financial results show mixed performance, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter that aligns with analyst expectations. This has provided some optimism to investors, leading to a stock price increase of over 3% during after-hours trading. While there are significant challenges, particularly in the Chinese market and declining iPhone sales, the overall growth in services and better-than-expected performance in other product lines such as Mac and iPad help mitigate some concerns. However, worries regarding competition in AI and regulatory issues remain. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of it falling, reflecting cautious optimism in the investor sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7. Here\u2019s What Happens Next\" suggests a potential negative impact on Apple, although the article argues that concerns might be overblown. The key concern is the emergence of a cheaper AI model and its potential to disrupt the competitive landscape. Considering the previous predictions, opinions are divided, with some models focusing on Apple's positive revenue forecasts and strong past performance, increasing its stock price while others emphasize the AI threat, AR/VR project cancellation and associated risks. The trend seems to be a slight decrease in the probability of the stock rising as the potential negative impact of the AI competition gains more weight. Given this uncertainty, and acknowledging that the market may not have fully priced in the potential competitive threat from DeepSeek's AI, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. Though the article attempts to mitigate concerns, the uncertainty caused by AI competition and potential vulnerability is a strong enough factor to believe it will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Apple's inclusion in Warren Buffett's long-term holdings, which is generally positive for investor sentiment.  However, the article also presents conflicting information.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features suggest potential short-term negative impacts on the stock price.  Conversely, Buffett's continued long-term investment suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, suggesting uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news.  While the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong due to Buffett's continued investment, the short-term outlook is more uncertain due to the conflicting information presented in the article and the differing views of various prediction models. I am leaning slightly towards a higher probability of price increase due to the weight given to Buffett's long term investment and the company's consistent revenue growth. However, the risk factors should not be overlooked.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides.

Previous predictions from models like openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct also suggest cautious optimism, supporting a high probability of stock price increase. However, the mixed signals from different models and some negative factors such as AI competition and potential regulatory issues add some uncertainty.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent financial news presents a mixed picture. While the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast that aligns with analyst expectations, showing 4% overall revenue growth and a strong performance in the services division, there are significant concerns about declining iPhone sales, particularly in China, and heightened competition in the AI sector. The news highlights potential vulnerabilities with newer AI competitors, which could weigh on investor sentiment. The stock initially increased over 3% post-announcement, indicating some positive market reaction. However, with ongoing challenges in China and AI competition, investor optimism is cautious. Overall, considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately higher than that of falling, reflecting the initial positive response but tempered by the underlying challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a potential threat from DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to the 'Mag 7' stocks, including Apple. While the article suggests that Wall Street concerns might be overblown, the initial market reaction is likely to be cautious, as investors reassess the competitive landscape and Apple's vulnerability. Previous predictions show a trend of decreasing confidence in Apple's stock price rising, primarily due to increased concerns about AI competition, AR/VR project cancellation, and potential regulatory issues. Some models still consider Apple's positive revenue forecasts as a mitigating factor, but the overarching sentiment is shifting towards increased uncertainty. Therefore, I will lean towards the fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the fact that Apple is among Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks is positive, suggesting long-term confidence, several counterpoints exist. BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features point to potential short-term headwinds.  The previous predictions show significant divergence, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance. Some models emphasize the positive revenue forecast and Buffett's continued investment, while others highlight concerns about AI competition and the canceled AR glasses project.  Considering the mixed signals, the relatively neutral sentiment from the news itself (it's primarily about Buffett's portfolio and Apple's place within it, not a major new development), and the range of previous predictions, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the long-term positive signal of Buffett's holdings. However, the short-term risks are substantial enough to warrant a significant probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides.
