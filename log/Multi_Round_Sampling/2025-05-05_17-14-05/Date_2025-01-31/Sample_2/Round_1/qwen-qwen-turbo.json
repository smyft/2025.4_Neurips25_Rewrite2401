The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news suggests potential challenges for Apple due to its strategic decision to integrate AI in a manner that could be seen as 'following' rather than leading. This, combined with the overall performance of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and concerns about its valuations, may lead to a cautious market sentiment around Apple. Analysts project double-digit growth for competitors but highlight valuation risks for Apple. The market may react with uncertainty, leading to a balanced probability for both rise and fall in stock price, but with a slight lean towards a potential fall due to the strategic concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance for tech stocks in general during a specific trading session (Friday afternoon). Without knowing the specific performance of Apple within that mixed sector performance, or more granular details available in the premium content, it's difficult to confidently predict price movement. A mixed sector usually suggests some stocks are rising and some are falling; Apple could be in either category. However, the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative news creates a near equal chance for a rise or a fall. It's also only 'late afternoon', giving the stock more time to move in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst specifically points to a slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps as significant concerns. This negative analyst opinion strongly suggests a potential downward pressure on the stock price. However, the article also highlights that Apple is still considered a strong AI stock by some, holding a significant number of hedge fund positions.  The overall picture is nuanced, with both bearish (downgrade, concerns about AI innovation) and bullish (high hedge fund holdings, general ranking among AI stocks) factors at play.  The negativity from the analyst report is given more weight due to the specifics of their reasons and the downgrade itself.  Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall, although the probability does not reach a high value due to countervailing factors like the continued presence of hedge fund investment and continued perceived value as an AI stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and its performance, particularly focusing on its top holdings including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The analysis highlights concerns about Apple's strategic pivot towards integrating ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership, which is seen as a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning. Additionally, the fund's concentration in potentially overvalued assets like Nvidia and Microsoft introduces meaningful risk. These factors suggest near-term headwinds for AAPL's stock price. However, the long-term outlook for AI and technology remains positive, which could provide some support.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company's performance was driven by strong iPhone sales, especially in emerging markets, and a significant increase in Services revenue. Despite challenges such as a decline in Greater China revenue and competitive pressures, the overall positive financial results and optimistic outlook for future innovation and growth in emerging markets are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. However, the decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue and foreign exchange headwinds could temper some of the enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's quarterly profit and sales came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter last year. The company's services revenue also saw a 14% increase. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and there are concerns about the company's cautious approach to rolling out AI services. Despite this, the stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket, suggesting a positive reaction to the earnings report. Considering the overall strong quarter and the positive premarket reaction, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
