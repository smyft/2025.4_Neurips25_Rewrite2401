(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news suggests potential challenges for Apple due to its strategic decision to integrate AI in a manner that could be seen as 'following' rather than leading. This, combined with the overall performance of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and concerns about its valuations, may lead to a cautious market sentiment around Apple. Analysts project double-digit growth for competitors but highlight valuation risks for Apple. The market may react with uncertainty, leading to a balanced probability for both rise and fall in stock price, but with a slight lean towards a potential fall due to the strategic concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance for tech stocks in general during a specific trading session (Friday afternoon). Without knowing the specific performance of Apple within that mixed sector performance, or more granular details available in the premium content, it's difficult to confidently predict price movement. A mixed sector usually suggests some stocks are rising and some are falling; Apple could be in either category. However, the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative news creates a near equal chance for a rise or a fall. It's also only 'late afternoon', giving the stock more time to move in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst specifically points to a slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps as significant concerns. This negative analyst opinion strongly suggests a potential downward pressure on the stock price. However, the article also highlights that Apple is still considered a strong AI stock by some, holding a significant number of hedge fund positions.  The overall picture is nuanced, with both bearish (downgrade, concerns about AI innovation) and bullish (high hedge fund holdings, general ranking among AI stocks) factors at play.  The negativity from the analyst report is given more weight due to the specifics of their reasons and the downgrade itself.  Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall, although the probability does not reach a high value due to countervailing factors like the continued presence of hedge fund investment and continued perceived value as an AI stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and its performance, particularly focusing on its top holdings including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The analysis highlights concerns about Apple's strategic pivot towards integrating ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership, which is seen as a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning. Additionally, the fund's concentration in potentially overvalued assets like Nvidia and Microsoft introduces meaningful risk. These factors suggest near-term headwinds for AAPL's stock price. However, the long-term outlook for AI and technology remains positive, which could provide some support.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company's performance was driven by strong iPhone sales, especially in emerging markets, and a significant increase in Services revenue. Despite challenges such as a decline in Greater China revenue and competitive pressures, the overall positive financial results and optimistic outlook for future innovation and growth in emerging markets are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. However, the decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue and foreign exchange headwinds could temper some of the enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's quarterly profit and sales came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter last year. The company's services revenue also saw a 14% increase. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and there are concerns about the company's cautious approach to rolling out AI services. Despite this, the stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket, suggesting a positive reaction to the earnings report. Considering the overall strong quarter and the positive premarket reaction, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to concerns about its strategic pivot towards integrating AI with OpenAI, which might undermine its traditional innovation leadership. Additionally, the high concentration of assets in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and the elevated valuations of key competitors like Nvidia and Microsoft pose significant risk. While there are strong fundamentals in terms of revenue growth and a positive long-term AI outlook, the near-term challenges and potential perception of Apple as a follower rather than a leader in innovation weigh heavily on the sentiment. This leads to a slightly higher probability of price decline due to negative strategic implications, despite underlying strong financials.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The initial news headline 'Tech Stocks Mixed in Late Afternoon' is neutral, providing no specific insight into Apple's performance. The inability to access the premium content further limits analysis based purely on this headline. Considering the previous rounds of analysis, there is a wide range of probabilities associated with stock movement, with some models focusing on positive earnings while other focus on AI integration risks. Considering the neutral headling, and considering the varied viewpoints of previous analyses, I'll maintain a balance, slightly shifted towards the falling side just by considering that the news explicitly discusses 'mixed' performance with no further specifics. If Apple was notably rising, it would have likely made headline news. Therefore, lacking specifics suggests a more mixed-to-slightly negative reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the headline highlights concerns about Apple's AI innovation lagging behind competitors, the article itself contains contradictory information.  An Oppenheimer analyst downgrade citing weak iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and Chinese market challenges points towards a potential price fall. This negative outlook is reinforced by several previous model predictions. However, the article also mentions Apple's high ranking among AI stocks, a large number of hedge fund holders, and the ongoing rollout of Apple Intelligence.  The conflicting information makes a definitive prediction difficult. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price fall. Considering the analyst downgrade as a significant negative factor and the overall mixed signals, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to the countervailing factors. This prediction balances the bearish and bullish signals, leaning towards the negative sentiment presented by the Oppenheimer downgrade and corroborated by several previous models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), which includes AAPL, has historically outperformed the S&P 500, and AI's transformative potential could benefit Apple in the long term. However, the article highlights significant concerns, including Apple's strategic pivot to integrating ChatGPT, which is seen as a departure from its traditional innovation leadership, potentially eroding its premium market positioning. Additionally, the fund's concentration in potentially overvalued assets like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft introduces near-term risks. Given these factors, the market may react with caution, leaning slightly towards a negative sentiment in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news reports Apple's Q1 2025 earnings, highlighting record revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year, and record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. Positive points include all-time revenue records in multiple regions, strong iPhone sales, and a significant increase in Services revenue. However, negative points such as a decline in Greater China revenue by 11% year over year and a 2% decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue exist. Despite these challenges, the overall financial performance and optimistic outlook for future innovation and growth in emerging markets are likely to positively impact the stock price. The premarket reaction was positive, with the stock trading 3.4% higher. Considering the strong quarter and positive premarket reaction, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's quarterly profit and sales came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter last year. The company's services revenue also saw a 14% increase. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and there are concerns about the company's cautious approach to rolling out AI services. Despite this, the stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket, suggesting a positive reaction to the earnings report. Considering the overall strong quarter and the positive premarket reaction, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. Additionally, taking into account the predictions from other models, which provide a range of perspectives on the potential impact of Apple's earnings report and strategic decisions on its stock price, the majority suggest a cautious optimism with a leaning towards a rise in stock price due to the strong financial performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably. The mix of positive and negative indicators results in a relatively high probability of stock price rising, supported by other analysts' predictions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
