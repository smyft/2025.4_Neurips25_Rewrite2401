The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news suggests potential challenges for Apple due to its strategic decision to integrate AI in a manner that could be seen as 'following' rather than leading. This, combined with the overall performance of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and concerns about its valuations, may lead to a cautious market sentiment around Apple. Analysts project double-digit growth for competitors but highlight valuation risks for Apple. The market may react with uncertainty, leading to a balanced probability for both rise and fall in stock price, but with a slight lean towards a potential fall due to the strategic concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance for tech stocks in general during a specific trading session (Friday afternoon). Without knowing the specific performance of Apple within that mixed sector performance, or more granular details available in the premium content, it's difficult to confidently predict price movement. A mixed sector usually suggests some stocks are rising and some are falling; Apple could be in either category. However, the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative news creates a near equal chance for a rise or a fall. It's also only 'late afternoon', giving the stock more time to move in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst specifically points to a slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps as significant concerns. This negative analyst opinion strongly suggests a potential downward pressure on the stock price. However, the article also highlights that Apple is still considered a strong AI stock by some, holding a significant number of hedge fund positions.  The overall picture is nuanced, with both bearish (downgrade, concerns about AI innovation) and bullish (high hedge fund holdings, general ranking among AI stocks) factors at play.  The negativity from the analyst report is given more weight due to the specifics of their reasons and the downgrade itself.  Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall, although the probability does not reach a high value due to countervailing factors like the continued presence of hedge fund investment and continued perceived value as an AI stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and its performance, particularly focusing on its top holdings including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The analysis highlights concerns about Apple's strategic pivot towards integrating ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership, which is seen as a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning. Additionally, the fund's concentration in potentially overvalued assets like Nvidia and Microsoft introduces meaningful risk. These factors suggest near-term headwinds for AAPL's stock price. However, the long-term outlook for AI and technology remains positive, which could provide some support.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company's performance was driven by strong iPhone sales, especially in emerging markets, and a significant increase in Services revenue. Despite challenges such as a decline in Greater China revenue and competitive pressures, the overall positive financial results and optimistic outlook for future innovation and growth in emerging markets are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. However, the decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue and foreign exchange headwinds could temper some of the enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's quarterly profit and sales came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter last year. The company's services revenue also saw a 14% increase. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and there are concerns about the company's cautious approach to rolling out AI services. Despite this, the stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket, suggesting a positive reaction to the earnings report. Considering the overall strong quarter and the positive premarket reaction, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to concerns about its strategic pivot towards integrating AI with OpenAI, which might undermine its traditional innovation leadership. Additionally, the high concentration of assets in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and the elevated valuations of key competitors like Nvidia and Microsoft pose significant risk. While there are strong fundamentals in terms of revenue growth and a positive long-term AI outlook, the near-term challenges and potential perception of Apple as a follower rather than a leader in innovation weigh heavily on the sentiment. This leads to a slightly higher probability of price decline due to negative strategic implications, despite underlying strong financials.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The initial news headline 'Tech Stocks Mixed in Late Afternoon' is neutral, providing no specific insight into Apple's performance. The inability to access the premium content further limits analysis based purely on this headline. Considering the previous rounds of analysis, there is a wide range of probabilities associated with stock movement, with some models focusing on positive earnings while other focus on AI integration risks. Considering the neutral headling, and considering the varied viewpoints of previous analyses, I'll maintain a balance, slightly shifted towards the falling side just by considering that the news explicitly discusses 'mixed' performance with no further specifics. If Apple was notably rising, it would have likely made headline news. Therefore, lacking specifics suggests a more mixed-to-slightly negative reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the headline highlights concerns about Apple's AI innovation lagging behind competitors, the article itself contains contradictory information.  An Oppenheimer analyst downgrade citing weak iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and Chinese market challenges points towards a potential price fall. This negative outlook is reinforced by several previous model predictions. However, the article also mentions Apple's high ranking among AI stocks, a large number of hedge fund holders, and the ongoing rollout of Apple Intelligence.  The conflicting information makes a definitive prediction difficult. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price fall. Considering the analyst downgrade as a significant negative factor and the overall mixed signals, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to the countervailing factors. This prediction balances the bearish and bullish signals, leaning towards the negative sentiment presented by the Oppenheimer downgrade and corroborated by several previous models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), which includes AAPL, has historically outperformed the S&P 500, and AI's transformative potential could benefit Apple in the long term. However, the article highlights significant concerns, including Apple's strategic pivot to integrating ChatGPT, which is seen as a departure from its traditional innovation leadership, potentially eroding its premium market positioning. Additionally, the fund's concentration in potentially overvalued assets like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft introduces near-term risks. Given these factors, the market may react with caution, leaning slightly towards a negative sentiment in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news reports Apple's Q1 2025 earnings, highlighting record revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year, and record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. Positive points include all-time revenue records in multiple regions, strong iPhone sales, and a significant increase in Services revenue. However, negative points such as a decline in Greater China revenue by 11% year over year and a 2% decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue exist. Despite these challenges, the overall financial performance and optimistic outlook for future innovation and growth in emerging markets are likely to positively impact the stock price. The premarket reaction was positive, with the stock trading 3.4% higher. Considering the strong quarter and positive premarket reaction, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's quarterly profit and sales came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter last year. The company's services revenue also saw a 14% increase. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and there are concerns about the company's cautious approach to rolling out AI services. Despite this, the stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket, suggesting a positive reaction to the earnings report. Considering the overall strong quarter and the positive premarket reaction, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. Additionally, taking into account the predictions from other models, which provide a range of perspectives on the potential impact of Apple's earnings report and strategic decisions on its stock price, the majority suggest a cautious optimism with a leaning towards a rise in stock price due to the strong financial performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably. The mix of positive and negative indicators results in a relatively high probability of stock price rising, supported by other analysts' predictions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential challenges facing Apple Inc. (AAPL) amid strategic shifts towards AI integration with OpenAI, which may dilute its traditionally strong innovation position. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF's heavy reliance on AAPL, coupled with elevated valuations of its key holdings, introduces risks that might lead to investor caution. Notable concerns regarding competitive pressures and financial analysts downgrading Apple heighten the perception of risk. However, Apple still holds strong fundamentals, including record revenues and positive long-term growth potential driven by AI. Given the mixed signals presented in the news, the probabilities suggest a slight lean towards a price decline due to the negative implications of the strategic pivot and market uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector on Friday afternoon, without providing specific information on Apple's performance. Access to the premium article is required for a deeper analysis of Apple's specific situation. Considering the previous rounds of analysis, a range of factors have been highlighted including positive earnings, AI integration risks, and concerns around strategic pivots. Given the overall mixed sector performance and the absence of concrete positive or negative Apple-specific news in the headline, and considering the previous round leans towards the negative side compared to round 0, the probability of a fall is only slightly favored. I will adjust the probabilities with a slight lean toward a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the headline highlights concerns about Apple's lagging AI innovation and an Oppenheimer analyst downgrade cites weak iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and Chinese market challenges, suggesting a potential price fall, there are countervailing factors.  Apple maintains strong financial performance with record revenue and EPS, and it holds a significant position in the AI sector with substantial hedge fund holdings.  The previous predictions are also quite varied, with probabilities ranging widely.  However, the negative analyst report and consistently lower predictions in subsequent rounds that focus on the AI shortfalls carry significant weight. The strong financial results are positive, but the concerns about AI competitiveness are more impactful given that this is stated as the focus of the news article. Hence, the probability leans slightly towards a price fall, but not drastically so, acknowledging the positive financial news and hedge fund investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Given these factors, the market may react with caution, leaning slightly towards a negative sentiment in the short term. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities with a slight bias towards a price fall, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the strategic concerns and valuation risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news reports Apple's Q1 2025 earnings, highlighting record revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year, and record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. Positive points include all-time revenue records in multiple regions, strong iPhone sales, and a significant increase in Services revenue. However, negative points such as a decline in Greater China revenue by 11% year over year and a 2% decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue exist.
