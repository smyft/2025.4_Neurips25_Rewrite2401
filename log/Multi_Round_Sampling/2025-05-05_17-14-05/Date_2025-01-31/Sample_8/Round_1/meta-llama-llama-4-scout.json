      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\nNews Content: The company\u2019s stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, but AI isn\u2019t driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the EU's stance on antitrust fines, clarifying that they are not classified as taxes. While this could indicate a stricter regulatory environment for big tech companies like Apple, it appears to reaffirm regulatory commitments to consumer protection rather than suggest immediate financial penalties for Apple. Given that antitrust issues have been a long-standing concern for tech companies, this clarification might reduce some uncertainty. However, potential regulatory pressures remain a concern. Overall, I assess a higher probability of the stock price rising as there is a lack of immediate negative implications for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Positive factors include: 1) Positive futures market sentiment, suggesting a generally favorable market open. 2) Apple's guidance for the next quarter exceeding expectations, indicating strong iPhone demand. 3) Apple's cautious AI approach seemingly shielding it from recent market turbulence. Negative factors include the general uncertainty created by Trump's tariff threats, impacting the broader market which might also trickle down on individual stocks. Given the specific positive Apple news outweighing the market wide tariff woes with rosier outlook, I favor a slight increase probability that the stock price has a chance to rise\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple exceeding analyst estimates on Q1 earnings, particularly in its Services revenue, is generally positive news.  While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments', the overall beat suggests stronger-than-expected performance.  This positive news is likely to outweigh the negative aspects in the short term.  However, market reactions are complex and depend on many factors, including prevailing market sentiment and investor expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for a price rise but acknowledge a possibility of a price fall due to the mixed segment performance. The probability is weighted more towards a rise reflecting the overall positive earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which is in line with analysts' predictions, and reported record high revenue and profit. Services, Mac, and iPad divisions performed better than expected, which could be seen as positive indicators. Additionally, the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are significant concerns: a sharp decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. The mixed quarterly report and ongoing challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. The initial positive market reaction suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still a ways off, implying that the company's current AI capabilities or announcements may not be meeting market expectations or are not imminent. However, the content also mentions that the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Despite this, the overall implication that AI isn't yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones could temper enthusiasm. Given this mixed perspective, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to tempered expectations about Apple's AI impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. The failure to bring this project to market, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may lead to concerns about Apple's competitiveness in the emerging AR and VR markets. However, Apple's diverse product portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, may mitigate the negative impact. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and is guiding for solid growth. This positive performance and guidance often lead to an increase in investor confidence and consequently can result in higher stock prices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Considering the mixed perspective, I assess that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower due to tempered expectations about Apple's AI impact on iPhone upgrades.
