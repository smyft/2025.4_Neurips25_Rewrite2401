(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the EU's stance on antitrust fines, clarifying that they are not classified as taxes. While this could indicate a stricter regulatory environment for big tech companies like Apple, it appears to reaffirm regulatory commitments to consumer protection rather than suggest immediate financial penalties for Apple. Given that antitrust issues have been a long-standing concern for tech companies, this clarification might reduce some uncertainty. However, potential regulatory pressures remain a concern. Overall, I assess a higher probability of the stock price rising as there is a lack of immediate negative implications for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Positive factors include: 1) Positive futures market sentiment, suggesting a generally favorable market open. 2) Apple's guidance for the next quarter exceeding expectations, indicating strong iPhone demand. 3) Apple's cautious AI approach seemingly shielding it from recent market turbulence. Negative factors include the general uncertainty created by Trump's tariff threats, impacting the broader market which might also trickle down on individual stocks. Given the specific positive Apple news outweighing the market wide tariff woes with rosier outlook, I favor a slight increase probability that the stock price has a chance to rise\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple exceeding analyst estimates on Q1 earnings, particularly in its Services revenue, is generally positive news.  While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments', the overall beat suggests stronger-than-expected performance.  This positive news is likely to outweigh the negative aspects in the short term.  However, market reactions are complex and depend on many factors, including prevailing market sentiment and investor expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for a price rise but acknowledge a possibility of a price fall due to the mixed segment performance. The probability is weighted more towards a rise reflecting the overall positive earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which is in line with analysts' predictions, and reported record high revenue and profit. Services, Mac, and iPad divisions performed better than expected, which could be seen as positive indicators. Additionally, the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are significant concerns: a sharp decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. The mixed quarterly report and ongoing challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. The initial positive market reaction suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still a ways off, implying that the company's current AI capabilities or announcements may not be meeting market expectations or are not imminent. However, the content also mentions that the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Despite this, the overall implication that AI isn't yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones could temper enthusiasm. Given this mixed perspective, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to tempered expectations about Apple's AI impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. The failure to bring this project to market, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may lead to concerns about Apple's competitiveness in the emerging AR and VR markets. However, Apple's diverse product portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, may mitigate the negative impact. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and is guiding for solid growth. This positive performance and guidance often lead to an increase in investor confidence and consequently can result in higher stock prices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the EU's stance on antitrust fines, affirming their role in consumer protection while clarifying that these fines should not be viewed as a tax. This clarification may reduce some regulatory uncertainty faced by Apple, potentially contributing to positive investor sentiment. However, concerns linger regarding broader regulatory pressures on big tech, especially amidst geopolitical tensions from figures like Trump. Given the mixed reactions in previous predictions, which reflect both positive earnings expectations and ongoing concerns for Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rising due to the news potentially alleviating some regulatory fears. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.65 for price rise and 0.35 for price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include higher futures, Apple's guidance exceeding expectations for the next quarter, and a resilient stock performance despite broader market uncertainties. The negative factors involve Trump's tariff threats potentially impacting the market and concerns about Apple's new AI not available in some markets and iPhone sales missing estimates during the key holiday shopping quarter. Considering all factors, there are slightly more encouraging elements related to the increase in the stock price. Also, taking into the prevous rounds of predictions result indicates the upward trend of stock price over time.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The headline and news content clearly indicate positive news for Apple.  Beating analyst estimates, especially in the Services sector, is a strong signal of financial health. While the article mentions mixed performance in other segments, the overall positive earnings report is likely to dominate market reaction in the short term.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.3 to 0.75 probability of a price rise.  However, a majority of models lean towards a higher probability of a rise, suggesting that the positive news will be perceived favorably by investors.  Considering the direct positive news and the generally positive trend in previous predictions, I assign a higher probability to a price rise than a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analysts' expectations, and reported record high revenue and profit. Key segments like Services, Mac, and iPad performed better than expected, and the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are notable concerns: an 11% decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. Challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. Given the initial positive market reaction and strong performance in some segments, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains. The previous predictions also show a tendency towards a higher probability of a rise, with most models favoring a slight increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. However, considering the mixed reactions and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, the impact might be mitigated. The overall market sentiment and Apple's diverse product portfolio could also play a role. Given the failure of the project and concerns about Apple's competitiveness in emerging markets, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news about the EU's clarification on antitrust fines not being viewed as a tax may reduce regulatory uncertainty for Apple, which could positively influence investor sentiment. While there are broader concerns regarding regulatory pressures and geopolitical tensions, the reaffirmation of the EU's commitment to consumer protection indicates a structured regulatory approach. Previous predictions indicate a general positive trend regarding Apple's performance, particularly with better-than-expected earnings. The mix of encouraging signals about Apple\u2019s strong demand and performance in key segments outweighs the potential negative impacts of ongoing challenges. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Positive factors include higher stock futures, better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter, and resilience during recent market volatility related to AI developments. The company's cautious approach to AI could be viewed favorably by investors. However, negative factors persist, primarily Trump's tariff threats, which introduce broad market uncertainty. Additionally, concerns about iPhone sales lagging estimates in the holiday quarter and new AI function unavailability in some markets remain. Previous predictions show a mean of around 0.634 for the stock price rising, and that's a piece of information I need to acknowledge. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock rising is moderately high, given positive outlook. However, potential tariff-induced pressures introduce some uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is positive, showing Apple beat analyst estimates in Q1, particularly in Services revenue.  While the news mentions mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat is significant. The previous predictions are mixed, but show a trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, particularly in the second round.  Some models highlight concerns about AI competitiveness, China sales, and potential tariffs, but the positive earnings news should outweigh these short-term concerns.  The consensus leans toward a price rise, although the uncertainty introduced by macroeconomic factors requires a degree of caution.  Therefore, despite some negative factors and the mixed nature of prior predictions, the overall positive news warrants a prediction that favors a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include the company's reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analysts' expectations, and record high revenue and profit. Key segments like Services, Mac, and iPad performed better than expected, and the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are notable concerns: an 11% decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. Challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. Given the initial positive market reaction and strong performance in some segments, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains. The previous predictions also show a tendency towards a higher probability of a rise, with most models favoring a slight increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that Apple's current AI capabilities or announcements may not be meeting market expectations or are not imminent. However, the content also mentions that the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Despite this, the overall implication that AI isn't yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones could temper enthusiasm. Considering the mixed reactions from previous predictions, which reflect both positive earnings expectations and ongoing concerns for Apple, I estimate a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising due to tempered expectations about Apple's AI impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. However, considering Apple's diverse product portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, the impact might be mitigated. The failure of the project and concerns about Apple's competitiveness in emerging markets, like AR and VR, suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the previous predictions show a mixed trend, with some models favoring a slight increase and others a decrease. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's better-than-expected earnings and guidance for solid growth, which are positive factors that typically boost investor confidence and increase stock prices. Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, though with some mixed signals. Factors like geopolitical uncertainties and challenges in certain segments introduce some risk, but the overall positive performance and market sentiment suggest that the stock price is more likely to rise.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The clarification from the EU regarding antitrust fines as not being a tax may alleviate some regulatory uncertainty for Apple, positively influencing investor sentiment. While broader market concerns related to tariffs and AI advancements continue to loom, the overall positive news regarding Apple's strong earnings performance and resilience amidst market challenges suggests a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. The previous rounds of predictions indicate a trend towards a more favorable outlook for Apple's stock, further supporting this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall slightly positive outlook for Apple. The positive aspects include: 1) Futures are higher, indicating a positive sentiment at the market open. 2) Apple's guidance for the next quarter surpassed expectations, pointing to solid iPhone demand. 3) A more cautious approach to AI helped Apple to insulate from DeepSeek inspired turmoil. \n\nThe negative aspects include: 1) Renewed tariff threats from Trump introducing uncertainty to the broader market. 2) Apple's AI features aren't available in some markets. 3) iPhone sales missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter. \n\nConsidering the positive aspects, while taking the tariff related economic concerns into account, the probability of stock price rising should be higher than the stock price falling. Also considering the previous rounds of belief in the analysts, I would pick a higher probability for stock price to rise and a lower probability for stock price to fall. Thus the probability for a price rise is estimated at 0.72 and for a price fall it is estimated as 0.28.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings beat analyst expectations, driven by strong Services revenue.  This positive news is a significant factor suggesting a stock price rise. However, the report also acknowledges mixed performance in other segments, including weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and a decline in China sales.  These mixed results introduce some uncertainty.  Analyzing the previous prediction rounds reveals a general trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, though opinions diverge significantly.  Models emphasizing the positive earnings beat tend toward higher probabilities of a rise, while models focusing on the mixed performance and potential external factors (tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty) lean towards lower probabilities or even a higher chance of a fall. Considering the weight given to the earnings beat and the overall trend in previous predictions, I am assigning a higher probability of a price rise, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analysts' expectations, and reported record high revenue and profit.
