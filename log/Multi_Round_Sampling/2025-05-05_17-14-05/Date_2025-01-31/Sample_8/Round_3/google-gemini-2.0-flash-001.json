(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the EU's stance on antitrust fines, clarifying that they are not classified as taxes. While this could indicate a stricter regulatory environment for big tech companies like Apple, it appears to reaffirm regulatory commitments to consumer protection rather than suggest immediate financial penalties for Apple. Given that antitrust issues have been a long-standing concern for tech companies, this clarification might reduce some uncertainty. However, potential regulatory pressures remain a concern. Overall, I assess a higher probability of the stock price rising as there is a lack of immediate negative implications for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Positive factors include: 1) Positive futures market sentiment, suggesting a generally favorable market open. 2) Apple's guidance for the next quarter exceeding expectations, indicating strong iPhone demand. 3) Apple's cautious AI approach seemingly shielding it from recent market turbulence. Negative factors include the general uncertainty created by Trump's tariff threats, impacting the broader market which might also trickle down on individual stocks. Given the specific positive Apple news outweighing the market wide tariff woes with rosier outlook, I favor a slight increase probability that the stock price has a chance to rise\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple exceeding analyst estimates on Q1 earnings, particularly in its Services revenue, is generally positive news.  While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments', the overall beat suggests stronger-than-expected performance.  This positive news is likely to outweigh the negative aspects in the short term.  However, market reactions are complex and depend on many factors, including prevailing market sentiment and investor expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for a price rise but acknowledge a possibility of a price fall due to the mixed segment performance. The probability is weighted more towards a rise reflecting the overall positive earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which is in line with analysts' predictions, and reported record high revenue and profit. Services, Mac, and iPad divisions performed better than expected, which could be seen as positive indicators. Additionally, the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are significant concerns: a sharp decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. The mixed quarterly report and ongoing challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. The initial positive market reaction suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still a ways off, implying that the company's current AI capabilities or announcements may not be meeting market expectations or are not imminent. However, the content also mentions that the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Despite this, the overall implication that AI isn't yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones could temper enthusiasm. Given this mixed perspective, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to tempered expectations about Apple's AI impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. The failure to bring this project to market, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may lead to concerns about Apple's competitiveness in the emerging AR and VR markets. However, Apple's diverse product portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, may mitigate the negative impact. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and is guiding for solid growth. This positive performance and guidance often lead to an increase in investor confidence and consequently can result in higher stock prices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the EU's stance on antitrust fines, affirming their role in consumer protection while clarifying that these fines should not be viewed as a tax. This clarification may reduce some regulatory uncertainty faced by Apple, potentially contributing to positive investor sentiment. However, concerns linger regarding broader regulatory pressures on big tech, especially amidst geopolitical tensions from figures like Trump. Given the mixed reactions in previous predictions, which reflect both positive earnings expectations and ongoing concerns for Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rising due to the news potentially alleviating some regulatory fears. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.65 for price rise and 0.35 for price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include higher futures, Apple's guidance exceeding expectations for the next quarter, and a resilient stock performance despite broader market uncertainties. The negative factors involve Trump's tariff threats potentially impacting the market and concerns about Apple's new AI not available in some markets and iPhone sales missing estimates during the key holiday shopping quarter. Considering all factors, there are slightly more encouraging elements related to the increase in the stock price. Also, taking into the prevous rounds of predictions result indicates the upward trend of stock price over time.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The headline and news content clearly indicate positive news for Apple.  Beating analyst estimates, especially in the Services sector, is a strong signal of financial health. While the article mentions mixed performance in other segments, the overall positive earnings report is likely to dominate market reaction in the short term.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.3 to 0.75 probability of a price rise.  However, a majority of models lean towards a higher probability of a rise, suggesting that the positive news will be perceived favorably by investors.  Considering the direct positive news and the generally positive trend in previous predictions, I assign a higher probability to a price rise than a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analysts' expectations, and reported record high revenue and profit. Key segments like Services, Mac, and iPad performed better than expected, and the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are notable concerns: an 11% decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. Challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. Given the initial positive market reaction and strong performance in some segments, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains. The previous predictions also show a tendency towards a higher probability of a rise, with most models favoring a slight increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. However, considering the mixed reactions and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, the impact might be mitigated. The overall market sentiment and Apple's diverse product portfolio could also play a role. Given the failure of the project and concerns about Apple's competitiveness in emerging markets, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news about the EU's clarification on antitrust fines not being viewed as a tax may reduce regulatory uncertainty for Apple, which could positively influence investor sentiment. While there are broader concerns regarding regulatory pressures and geopolitical tensions, the reaffirmation of the EU's commitment to consumer protection indicates a structured regulatory approach. Previous predictions indicate a general positive trend regarding Apple's performance, particularly with better-than-expected earnings. The mix of encouraging signals about Apple\u2019s strong demand and performance in key segments outweighs the potential negative impacts of ongoing challenges. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Positive factors include higher stock futures, better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter, and resilience during recent market volatility related to AI developments. The company's cautious approach to AI could be viewed favorably by investors. However, negative factors persist, primarily Trump's tariff threats, which introduce broad market uncertainty. Additionally, concerns about iPhone sales lagging estimates in the holiday quarter and new AI function unavailability in some markets remain. Previous predictions show a mean of around 0.634 for the stock price rising, and that's a piece of information I need to acknowledge. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock rising is moderately high, given positive outlook. However, potential tariff-induced pressures introduce some uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is positive, showing Apple beat analyst estimates in Q1, particularly in Services revenue.  While the news mentions mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat is significant. The previous predictions are mixed, but show a trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, particularly in the second round.  Some models highlight concerns about AI competitiveness, China sales, and potential tariffs, but the positive earnings news should outweigh these short-term concerns.  The consensus leans toward a price rise, although the uncertainty introduced by macroeconomic factors requires a degree of caution.  Therefore, despite some negative factors and the mixed nature of prior predictions, the overall positive news warrants a prediction that favors a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include the company's reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analysts' expectations, and record high revenue and profit.

However, the content also mentions that the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Despite this, the overall implication that AI isn't yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones could temper enthusiasm.

Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, though with some mixed signals. Factors like geopolitical uncertainties and challenges in certain segments introduce some risk, but the overall positive performance and market sentiment suggest that the stock price is more likely to rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
