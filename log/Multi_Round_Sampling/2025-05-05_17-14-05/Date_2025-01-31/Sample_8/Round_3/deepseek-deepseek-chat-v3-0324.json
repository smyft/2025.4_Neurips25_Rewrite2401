(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the EU's stance on antitrust fines, clarifying that they are not classified as taxes. While this could indicate a stricter regulatory environment for big tech companies like Apple, it appears to reaffirm regulatory commitments to consumer protection rather than suggest immediate financial penalties for Apple. Given that antitrust issues have been a long-standing concern for tech companies, this clarification might reduce some uncertainty. However, potential regulatory pressures remain a concern. Overall, I assess a higher probability of the stock price rising as there is a lack of immediate negative implications for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Positive factors include: 1) Positive futures market sentiment, suggesting a generally favorable market open. 2) Apple's guidance for the next quarter exceeding expectations, indicating strong iPhone demand. 3) Apple's cautious AI approach seemingly shielding it from recent market turbulence. Negative factors include the general uncertainty created by Trump's tariff threats, impacting the broader market which might also trickle down on individual stocks. Given the specific positive Apple news outweighing the market wide tariff woes with rosier outlook, I favor a slight increase probability that the stock price has a chance to rise\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple exceeding analyst estimates on Q1 earnings, particularly in its Services revenue, is generally positive news.  While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments', the overall beat suggests stronger-than-expected performance.  This positive news is likely to outweigh the negative aspects in the short term.  However, market reactions are complex and depend on many factors, including prevailing market sentiment and investor expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for a price rise but acknowledge a possibility of a price fall due to the mixed segment performance. The probability is weighted more towards a rise reflecting the overall positive earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which is in line with analysts' predictions, and reported record high revenue and profit. Services, Mac, and iPad divisions performed better than expected, which could be seen as positive indicators. Additionally, the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are significant concerns: a sharp decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. The mixed quarterly report and ongoing challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. The initial positive market reaction suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still a ways off, implying that the company's current AI capabilities or announcements may not be meeting market expectations or are not imminent. However, the content also mentions that the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Despite this, the overall implication that AI isn't yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones could temper enthusiasm. Given this mixed perspective, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to tempered expectations about Apple's AI impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. The failure to bring this project to market, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may lead to concerns about Apple's competitiveness in the emerging AR and VR markets. However, Apple's diverse product portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, may mitigate the negative impact. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and is guiding for solid growth. This positive performance and guidance often lead to an increase in investor confidence and consequently can result in higher stock prices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the EU's stance on antitrust fines, affirming their role in consumer protection while clarifying that these fines should not be viewed as a tax. This clarification may reduce some regulatory uncertainty faced by Apple, potentially contributing to positive investor sentiment. However, concerns linger regarding broader regulatory pressures on big tech, especially amidst geopolitical tensions from figures like Trump. Given the mixed reactions in previous predictions, which reflect both positive earnings expectations and ongoing concerns for Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rising due to the news potentially alleviating some regulatory fears. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.65 for price rise and 0.35 for price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include higher futures, Apple's guidance exceeding expectations for the next quarter, and a resilient stock performance despite broader market uncertainties. The negative factors involve Trump's tariff threats potentially impacting the market and concerns about Apple's new AI not available in some markets and iPhone sales missing estimates during the key holiday shopping quarter. Considering all factors, there are slightly more encouraging elements related to the increase in the stock price. Also, taking into the prevous rounds of predictions result indicates the upward trend of stock price over time.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The headline and news content clearly indicate positive news for Apple.  Beating analyst estimates, especially in the Services sector, is a strong signal of financial health. While the article mentions mixed performance in other segments, the overall positive earnings report is likely to dominate market reaction in the short term.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.3 to 0.75 probability of a price rise.  However, a majority of models lean towards a higher probability of a rise, suggesting that the positive news will be perceived favorably by investors.  Considering the direct positive news and the generally positive trend in previous predictions, I assign a higher probability to a price rise than a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analysts' expectations, and reported record high revenue and profit. Key segments like Services, Mac, and iPad performed better than expected, and the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are notable concerns: an 11% decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. Challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. Given the initial positive market reaction and strong performance in some segments, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains. The previous predictions also show a tendency towards a higher probability of a rise, with most models favoring a slight increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. However, considering the mixed reactions and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, the impact might be mitigated. The overall market sentiment and Apple's diverse product portfolio could also play a role. Given the failure of the project and concerns about Apple's competitiveness in emerging markets, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news about the EU's clarification on antitrust fines not being viewed as a tax may reduce regulatory uncertainty for Apple, which could positively influence investor sentiment. While there are broader concerns regarding regulatory pressures and geopolitical tensions, the reaffirmation of the EU's commitment to consumer protection indicates a structured regulatory approach. Previous predictions indicate a general positive trend regarding Apple's performance, particularly with better-than-expected earnings. The mix of encouraging signals about Apple\u2019s strong demand and performance in key segments outweighs the potential negative impacts of ongoing challenges. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Positive factors include higher stock futures, better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter, and resilience during recent market volatility related to AI developments. The company's cautious approach to AI could be viewed favorably by investors. However, negative factors persist, primarily Trump's tariff threats, which introduce broad market uncertainty. Additionally, concerns about iPhone sales lagging estimates in the holiday quarter and new AI function unavailability in some markets remain. Previous predictions show a mean of around 0.634 for the stock price rising, and that's a piece of information I need to acknowledge. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock rising is moderately high, given positive outlook. However, potential tariff-induced pressures introduce some uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is positive, showing Apple beat analyst estimates in Q1, particularly in Services revenue.  While the news mentions mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat is significant. The previous predictions are mixed, but show a trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, particularly in the second round.  Some models highlight concerns about AI competitiveness, China sales, and potential tariffs, but the positive earnings news should outweigh these short-term concerns.  The consensus leans toward a price rise, although the uncertainty introduced by macroeconomic factors requires a degree of caution.  Therefore, despite some negative factors and the mixed nature of prior predictions, the overall positive news warrants a prediction that favors a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include the company's reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analysts' expectations, and record high revenue and profit. Key segments like Services, Mac, and iPad performed better than expected, and the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating initial investor confidence. However, there are notable concerns: an 11% decline in China sales, disappointing iPhone sales, struggles in the wearables segment, and lagging behind in AI compared to peers. Challenges in key markets like China and the EU, along with potential tariffs, add uncertainty. Given the initial positive market reaction and strong performance in some segments, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher, but the underlying issues could temper long-term gains. The previous predictions also show a tendency towards a higher probability of a rise, with most models favoring a slight increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that Apple's current AI capabilities or announcements may not be meeting market expectations or are not imminent. However, the content also mentions that the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Despite this, the overall implication that AI isn't yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones could temper enthusiasm. Considering the mixed reactions from previous predictions, which reflect both positive earnings expectations and ongoing concerns for Apple, I estimate a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising due to tempered expectations about Apple's AI impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project may negatively impact investor confidence in the company's ability to innovate and expand its product lineup. However, considering Apple's diverse product portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, the impact might be mitigated. The failure of the project and concerns about Apple's competitiveness in emerging markets, like AR and VR, suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the previous predictions show a mixed trend, with some models favoring a slight increase and others a decrease. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's better-than-expected earnings and guidance for solid growth, which are positive factors that typically boost investor confidence and increase stock prices. Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, though with some mixed signals. Factors like geopolitical uncertainties and challenges in certain segments introduce some risk, but the overall positive performance and market sentiment suggest that the stock price is more likely to rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
