While this could indicate a stricter regulatory environment for big tech companies like Apple, it appears to reaffirm regulatory commitments to consumer protection rather than suggest immediate financial penalties for Apple. Given that antitrust issues have been a long-standing concern for tech companies, this clarification might reduce some uncertainty. However, potential regulatory pressures remain a concern. Overall, I assess a higher probability of the stock price rising as there is a lack of immediate negative implications for Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}"
