A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The cancellation of the augmented reality glasses project reflects Apple's ongoing struggles in the AR space, signaling potential weaknesses in future product offerings. Moreover, this setback comes at a time when the Vision Pro has not performed as expected in terms of consumer adoption. Given that the news highlights sustained challenges and a lack of innovation in a key growth area, it could dampen investor sentiment, leading to a higher likelihood of stock price decline. However, Apple's overall strong financial position and diversified product lines may mitigate drastic negative reactions in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall than rise in response to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock is moving significantly today. The news content specifies that Apple's rise is driven by better-than-expected earnings and positive growth guidance. This suggests strong positive sentiment and a high likelihood of continued upward momentum for the stock. While overall market conditions and future news could affect the stock, the immediate reaction to positive earnings reports is usually positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple's stock is currently receiving a boost (likely due to the mentioned 'DeepSeek' news, which is not detailed here), this positive momentum isn't directly driven by significant advancements in Apple's AI capabilities or a resulting surge in iPhone upgrades. The implication is that the current positive sentiment might be temporary or unrelated to long-term AI-driven growth.  This makes it less likely the positive momentum will continue solely based on the AI narrative.  Therefore, the probability of a rise is lower than it would be if the news contained evidence of strong AI-related growth. There's also a chance that the market could react negatively if investor enthusiasm about AI begins to wane, particularly if 'DeepSeek' proves to be a short-lived catalyst.  The probabilities are assigned based on this nuanced interpretation of the headline and the lack of more specific information.  They reflect the balance between existing positive momentum and potential for future correction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors influencing Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price. Positive aspects include higher U.S. stock futures, Apple's better-than-expected sales growth guidance for the fiscal second quarter, and the rebound in extended hours trading. The company's cautious approach to AI has also insulated it from recent market turmoil. However, potential negatives include broader market uncertainty due to Trump's tariff threats, which could impact global trade and inflation, and the upcoming PCE inflation data that might influence Federal Reserve policy. Overall, the positive earnings outlook and market momentum seem to outweigh the broader uncertainties, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still a ways off, implying that the company's immediate prospects in AI are not as strong as perhaps expected. However, the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. The article also mentions that AI isn't yet driving a rush to upgrade iPhones, which could be seen as a negative factor for Apple's short-term growth. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook, but the current boost might slightly favor a rise in stock price in the short term, though with a low confidence level.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its project to build Mac-connected augmented reality glasses may have a negative impact on the stock price. The cancellation of this project, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may raise concerns about Apple's ability to innovate and compete in the augmented reality market. Additionally, the fact that the company has axed several other promising technologies in the past may lead to a loss of investor confidence. However, Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong track record of innovation, so the impact of this news may be limited. Overall, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed performance for tech stocks, as seen in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. Without specific details about Apple Inc.'s individual stock performance, it's challenging to predict precise probabilities. However, as a major player in the technology sector, Apple's performance often aligns with broader trends affecting the sector. With mixed signals from the broader sector, we'll lean towards moderate probabilities.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
