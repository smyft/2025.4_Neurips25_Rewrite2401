      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The cancellation of the augmented reality glasses project reflects Apple's ongoing struggles in the AR space, signaling potential weaknesses in future product offerings. Moreover, this setback comes at a time when the Vision Pro has not performed as expected in terms of consumer adoption. Given that the news highlights sustained challenges and a lack of innovation in a key growth area, it could dampen investor sentiment, leading to a higher likelihood of stock price decline. However, Apple's overall strong financial position and diversified product lines may mitigate drastic negative reactions in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall than rise in response to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock is moving significantly today. The news content specifies that Apple's rise is driven by better-than-expected earnings and positive growth guidance. This suggests strong positive sentiment and a high likelihood of continued upward momentum for the stock. While overall market conditions and future news could affect the stock, the immediate reaction to positive earnings reports is usually positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple's stock is currently receiving a boost (likely due to the mentioned 'DeepSeek' news, which is not detailed here), this positive momentum isn't directly driven by significant advancements in Apple's AI capabilities or a resulting surge in iPhone upgrades. The implication is that the current positive sentiment might be temporary or unrelated to long-term AI-driven growth.  This makes it less likely the positive momentum will continue solely based on the AI narrative.  Therefore, the probability of a rise is lower than it would be if the news contained evidence of strong AI-related growth. There's also a chance that the market could react negatively if investor enthusiasm about AI begins to wane, particularly if 'DeepSeek' proves to be a short-lived catalyst.  The probabilities are assigned based on this nuanced interpretation of the headline and the lack of more specific information.  They reflect the balance between existing positive momentum and potential for future correction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors influencing Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price. Positive aspects include higher U.S. stock futures, Apple's better-than-expected sales growth guidance for the fiscal second quarter, and the rebound in extended hours trading. The company's cautious approach to AI has also insulated it from recent market turmoil. However, potential negatives include broader market uncertainty due to Trump's tariff threats, which could impact global trade and inflation, and the upcoming PCE inflation data that might influence Federal Reserve policy. Overall, the positive earnings outlook and market momentum seem to outweigh the broader uncertainties, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still a ways off, implying that the company's immediate prospects in AI are not as strong as perhaps expected. However, the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. The article also mentions that AI isn't yet driving a rush to upgrade iPhones, which could be seen as a negative factor for Apple's short-term growth. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook, but the current boost might slightly favor a rise in stock price in the short term, though with a low confidence level.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its project to build Mac-connected augmented reality glasses may have a negative impact on the stock price. The cancellation of this project, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may raise concerns about Apple's ability to innovate and compete in the augmented reality market. Additionally, the fact that the company has axed several other promising technologies in the past may lead to a loss of investor confidence. However, Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong track record of innovation, so the impact of this news may be limited. Overall, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed performance for tech stocks, as seen in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. Without specific details about Apple Inc.'s individual stock performance, it's challenging to predict precise probabilities. However, as a major player in the technology sector, Apple's performance often aligns with broader trends affecting the sector. With mixed signals from the broader sector, we'll lean towards moderate probabilities.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The cancellation of the AR glasses project indicates ongoing challenges in Apple's innovation pipeline, particularly in emerging technologies like augmented reality. This news suggests potential weaknesses in product strategy and market positioning, especially when Apple is struggling to gain traction with its Vision Pro headset. Given the context of these setbacks, investor sentiment is likely to be dampened, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified product offerings may provide some support and buffer against drastic declines. Based on these factors, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news clearly states that Apple's stock is rising because of better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance. This is a very strong positive signal. Examining the prior predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Round 0 provides an interesting contrast. Some models focused more on Apple's challenges in AR, while the Gemini model highlighted the positive earnings. This new information should override the earlier AR concerns, thus I predicting a high probability of stock price rise. The news directly states Apple is rising whereas intel and visa are just listed next to apple. Exxon only stated that they and chevron will report quarterly earnings on Friday, but no number are given.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture. While Apple's stock is currently receiving a boost from the 'DeepSeek' news (unspecified), the article emphasizes that this isn't fueled by significant AI advancements or iPhone upgrade demand.  This suggests the positive momentum may be temporary and unrelated to Apple's long-term AI strategy. The lack of detail regarding 'DeepSeek' introduces uncertainty. Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions. Some models highlight Apple's overall strength and positive earnings, while others focus on the limitations of its AI progress and potential market corrections. Considering the mixed signals, the current positive momentum is likely to be short-lived unless further positive news related to 'DeepSeek' or a different catalyst emerges.  The probability of a stock price rise is therefore tempered by the potential for a correction once the 'DeepSeek' effect subsides, weighing the short-term boost against the long-term uncertainties about AI progress.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag of factors influencing Apple Inc.'s stock price. On the positive side, U.S. stock futures are higher, and Apple's earnings report showed better-than-expected sales growth guidance for the fiscal second quarter, which has already led to a rebound in extended hours trading. The company's cautious approach to AI has also insulated it from recent market turmoil affecting other Big Tech stocks. However, there are significant risks, including renewed tariff threats from former President Trump, which could spark trade wars and inflationary pressures, and the upcoming PCE inflation data that might influence Federal Reserve policy. While the positive earnings outlook and market momentum are strong, the broader uncertainties from geopolitical and economic factors temper the optimism. Considering the balance of these factors and the previous predictions, which leaned slightly towards a positive outlook, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that Apple's immediate prospects in AI are not as strong as perhaps expected. However, the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. The article also mentions that AI isn't yet driving a rush to upgrade iPhones, which could be seen as a negative factor for Apple's short-term growth. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions from various models, there seems to be a cautious outlook. The probabilities are influenced by the balance between the current positive momentum and the potential for future correction or negative reaction if investor enthusiasm about AI begins to wane.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project is a negative development, indicating the company's struggles in innovation and competition in the augmented reality market. Additionally, the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro and the axing of other promising technologies may raise concerns about Apple's ability to innovate and compete. However, Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong track record of innovation, which may mitigate the negative impact of this news. Considering the mixed signals and the company's overall strength, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling and a lower probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates mixed performance for tech stocks in general but provides no specific details about Apple's stock performance. Previous predictions show a mix of probabilities with some models predicting a rise and others predicting a fall. The cancellation of the augmented reality glasses project and slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro suggest concerns over innovation, but Apple's strong overall financial position and diversification can mitigate short-term negative impacts. Considering the mixed signals and previous model predictions, the probability of either a rise or fall in stock price remains relatively balanced, but leans slightly towards a decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project indicates ongoing challenges in their innovation strategy, particularly in a key growth area for technology and consumer products. This decision, along with slow sales for the high-priced Apple Vision Pro, raises concerns about Apple's ability to maintain competitive momentum in the augmented reality market. Given the historical context of recent project cancellations and struggles in consumer adoption, investor sentiment may take a hit, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. However, Apple's overall solid financial position, diversification, and established brand may provide some resilience against drastic price drops. Thus, while the probability of a stock price fall is higher in response to this news, the overall impact may be moderated by investor confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news clearly states that Apple's stock is rising following better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance, which is a strong positive signal. Taking into account the Round 0 and Round 1 predictions, the Gemini models consistently highlighted the positive earnings news, while other models focused on concerns regarding Apple's AR projects. The fact that the stock *is* rising should outweigh those older concerns. While broader market factors related to trade and inflation always present a risk, the immediate impact of the positive earnings report takes precedence, pushing the likelihood of a rise higher. Additionally, given the time passed since Round 0, the news of earnings has had time to settle and influence the current stock movement, solidifying the positive trend. The consistent positive reporting of earnings and guidance cannot be dismissed. The earnings trumps the AR concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple's stock is currently receiving a boost from unspecified 'DeepSeek' news, the headline emphasizes that this isn't driven by significant AI advancements or iPhone upgrade demand. This suggests the positive momentum may be temporary and unrelated to Apple's long-term AI strategy.  The lack of detail about 'DeepSeek' is a major uncertainty.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting this ambiguity. Some models highlight Apple's overall strength and positive earnings, while others focus on limitations in AI progress and potential market corrections.  Considering the mixed signals and the temporary nature of the 'DeepSeek' boost, the probability of a rise is lower than it would be with stronger AI-related news.  The chance of a correction once the 'DeepSeek' effect subsides increases the likelihood of a fall.  The overall uncertainty leads to a probability closer to 50/50, but slightly favoring a fall given the lack of sustained positive drivers.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include higher U.S. stock futures, better-than-expected sales growth guidance for Apple's fiscal second quarter, and a rebound in extended hours trading. The company's cautious approach to AI has also insulated it from recent market turmoil. However, potential negatives include broader market uncertainty due to Trump's tariff threats, which could impact global trade and inflation, and the upcoming PCE inflation data that might influence Federal Reserve policy. Additionally, while Apple's earnings outlook is positive, concerns about iPhone sales missing estimates and the lack of immediate AI-driven upgrades temper the optimism. Balancing these factors, the positive earnings outlook and market momentum seem to slightly outweigh the broader uncertainties, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that Apple's immediate prospects in AI are not as strong as perhaps expected. However, the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. The article also mentions that AI isn't yet driving a rush to upgrade iPhones, which could be seen as a negative factor for Apple's short-term growth. Considering the mixed signals and previous predictions from various models, there seems to be a cautious outlook. The probabilities are influenced by the balance between the current positive momentum and the potential for future correction or negative reaction if investor enthusiasm about AI begins to wane. Given the overall analysis, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with a cautious stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project indicates a setback in the company's innovation efforts, particularly in the emerging technology of augmented reality. This cancellation, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may raise concerns about Apple's ability to innovate and compete in this market. While Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong track record of innovation, the cumulative effect of canceling multiple promising projects and the struggle to gain traction in new markets could dampen investor sentiment. However, the company's strong financial position and diversified product lines may mitigate drastic negative reactions in the short term. Considering these factors and the mixed opinions from previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling due to the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates mixed performance for tech stocks in general but provides no specific details about Apple's stock performance. Previous predictions show a mix of probabilities with some models predicting a rise and others predicting a fall. The cancellation of the augmented reality glasses project and slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro suggest concerns over innovation, but Apple's strong overall financial position and diversification can mitigate short-term negative impacts. Considering the mixed signals and previous model predictions, the probability of either a rise or fall in stock price remains relatively balanced, but leans slightly towards a decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
