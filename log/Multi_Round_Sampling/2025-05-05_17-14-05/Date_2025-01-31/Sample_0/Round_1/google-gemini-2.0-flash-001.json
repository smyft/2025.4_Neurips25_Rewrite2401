(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\nNews Content: Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple has seen increased iPhone sales in markets where AI features have been introduced, which is a positive indicator for the company's revenue potential. However, the mention of a 'limited rollout' implies that this growth may not be sustained or widespread, potentially dampening enthusiasm. Overall, while there is a positive outlook on sales due to AI, the limitations could cause some hesitancy among investors. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with some caution.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the overall sales outlook is positive and exceeded expectations, driven by iPhone demand momentum, iPhone sales actually fell short of estimates, particularly in China. The growth in the services unit is a positive sign. The impact of Apple Intelligence is noted as beneficial but not yet fully realized due to limited availability. Analysts describe the results as 'mixed', with China concerns overshadowing positive areas. The initial pre-market reaction was a dip, followed by a rebound, suggesting investor uncertainty. Also a detail not to ignore, market turmoil affected other big tech companies, but Apple was relatively insulated. Overall, the positive outlook and Apple Intelligence are the main drivers for potential upside, while weak iPhone sales and China performance are the main downside risks, the market gives more importance to the overall sales outlook. Considering these factors, i think investors will focus more on the positive outlook than on some negative details that are affecting it.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive AI-related capital expenditure as a positive, potentially making it less vulnerable to the negative impacts affecting other Big Tech companies like Nvidia, he maintains a 'Hold' rating. This 'Hold' rating suggests a lack of strong conviction regarding near-term upward price movement.  The analyst also expresses concern regarding the mismatch between hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These negative factors counterbalance the positive aspect of Apple's less risky CapEx strategy. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outlook, with a marginally higher probability of the price remaining stable or experiencing minor fluctuations rather than a significant upward or downward movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's premarket gain of 3.4% following a strong sales growth forecast, which reassures investors about the company's recovery from a dip in iPhone sales. Additionally, the broader market sentiment is positive as U.S. stock index futures rise, driven by Apple's performance and anticipation of key inflation data. The positive guidance from Apple's executives and the overall market uplift suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the looming inflation data could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company saw significant growth in Services revenue, which reached $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. iPhone revenue hit an all-time record at $69.1 billion, and the installed base of active devices reached over 2.35 billion. Despite challenges such as an 11% decline in Greater China revenue and a 2% decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, the overall financial performance was strong. The positive aspects, including record revenues and EPS, and the well-received Apple Intelligence features, are likely to drive the stock price up. However, concerns about competitive pressures in China and foreign exchange headwinds may temper the rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's integration of AI in its devices, with a focus on personal privacy. The company has launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, which processes data on-device to ensure user privacy. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, with a 6% increase from the previous year. However, the introduction of AI features in the iPhone 16 series did not result in a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI. Despite this, the article suggests that AI is expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion, with Apple being one of the key players in the AI industry. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, due to the long-term potential of AI and Apple's position in the industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported better-than-expected fiscal Q1 results, which is positive news for the company. Typically, such good results lead to increased investor confidence and potential upward pressure on the stock price. However, the broader market trends should also be considered, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up, suggesting a generally positive market sentiment which may also support AAPL's stock price. Therefore, it is probable that the stock price will rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
