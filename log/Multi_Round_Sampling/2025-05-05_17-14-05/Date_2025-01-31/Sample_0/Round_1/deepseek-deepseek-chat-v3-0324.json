(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple lifts US stock index futures as crucial inflation test looms\nNews Content: (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple has seen increased iPhone sales in markets where AI features have been introduced, which is a positive indicator for the company's revenue potential. However, the mention of a 'limited rollout' implies that this growth may not be sustained or widespread, potentially dampening enthusiasm. Overall, while there is a positive outlook on sales due to AI, the limitations could cause some hesitancy among investors. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with some caution.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the overall sales outlook is positive and exceeded expectations, driven by iPhone demand momentum, iPhone sales actually fell short of estimates, particularly in China. The growth in the services unit is a positive sign. The impact of Apple Intelligence is noted as beneficial but not yet fully realized due to limited availability. Analysts describe the results as 'mixed', with China concerns overshadowing positive areas. The initial pre-market reaction was a dip, followed by a rebound, suggesting investor uncertainty. Also a detail not to ignore, market turmoil affected other big tech companies, but Apple was relatively insulated. Overall, the positive outlook and Apple Intelligence are the main drivers for potential upside, while weak iPhone sales and China performance are the main downside risks, the market gives more importance to the overall sales outlook. Considering these factors, i think investors will focus more on the positive outlook than on some negative details that are affecting it.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive AI-related capital expenditure as a positive, potentially making it less vulnerable to the negative impacts affecting other Big Tech companies like Nvidia, he maintains a 'Hold' rating. This 'Hold' rating suggests a lack of strong conviction regarding near-term upward price movement.  The analyst also expresses concern regarding the mismatch between hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These negative factors counterbalance the positive aspect of Apple's less risky CapEx strategy. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outlook, with a marginally higher probability of the price remaining stable or experiencing minor fluctuations rather than a significant upward or downward movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's premarket gain of 3.4% following a strong sales growth forecast, which reassures investors about the company's recovery from a dip in iPhone sales. Additionally, the broader market sentiment is positive as U.S. stock index futures rise, driven by Apple's performance and anticipation of key inflation data. The positive guidance from Apple's executives and the overall market uplift suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the looming inflation data could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company saw significant growth in Services revenue, which reached $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. iPhone revenue hit an all-time record at $69.1 billion, and the installed base of active devices reached over 2.35 billion. Despite challenges such as an 11% decline in Greater China revenue and a 2% decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, the overall financial performance was strong. The positive aspects, including record revenues and EPS, and the well-received Apple Intelligence features, are likely to drive the stock price up. However, concerns about competitive pressures in China and foreign exchange headwinds may temper the rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's integration of AI in its devices, with a focus on personal privacy. The company has launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, which processes data on-device to ensure user privacy. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, with a 6% increase from the previous year. However, the introduction of AI features in the iPhone 16 series did not result in a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI. Despite this, the article suggests that AI is expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion, with Apple being one of the key players in the AI industry. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, due to the long-term potential of AI and Apple's position in the industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported better-than-expected fiscal Q1 results, which is positive news for the company. Typically, such good results lead to increased investor confidence and potential upward pressure on the stock price. However, the broader market trends should also be considered, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up, suggesting a generally positive market sentiment which may also support AAPL's stock price. Therefore, it is probable that the stock price will rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
