      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: AI Fueling Apple iPhone Sales But Limited Rollout Has Hurt\nNews Content: Apple iPhone sales rose in those markets where the company rolled out artificial intelligence features. The news was positive for Apple stock.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple has seen increased iPhone sales in markets where AI features have been introduced, which is a positive indicator for the company's revenue potential. However, the mention of a 'limited rollout' implies that this growth may not be sustained or widespread, potentially dampening enthusiasm. Overall, while there is a positive outlook on sales due to AI, the limitations could cause some hesitancy among investors. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with some caution.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the overall sales outlook is positive and exceeded expectations, driven by iPhone demand momentum, iPhone sales actually fell short of estimates, particularly in China. The growth in the services unit is a positive sign. The impact of Apple Intelligence is noted as beneficial but not yet fully realized due to limited availability. Analysts describe the results as 'mixed', with China concerns overshadowing positive areas. The initial pre-market reaction was a dip, followed by a rebound, suggesting investor uncertainty. Also a detail not to ignore, market turmoil affected other big tech companies, but Apple was relatively insulated. Overall, the positive outlook and Apple Intelligence are the main drivers for potential upside, while weak iPhone sales and China performance are the main downside risks, the market gives more importance to the overall sales outlook. Considering these factors, i think investors will focus more on the positive outlook than on some negative details that are affecting it.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive AI-related capital expenditure as a positive, potentially making it less vulnerable to the negative impacts affecting other Big Tech companies like Nvidia, he maintains a 'Hold' rating. This 'Hold' rating suggests a lack of strong conviction regarding near-term upward price movement.  The analyst also expresses concern regarding the mismatch between hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These negative factors counterbalance the positive aspect of Apple's less risky CapEx strategy. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outlook, with a marginally higher probability of the price remaining stable or experiencing minor fluctuations rather than a significant upward or downward movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's premarket gain of 3.4% following a strong sales growth forecast, which reassures investors about the company's recovery from a dip in iPhone sales. Additionally, the broader market sentiment is positive as U.S. stock index futures rise, driven by Apple's performance and anticipation of key inflation data. The positive guidance from Apple's executives and the overall market uplift suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the looming inflation data could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company saw significant growth in Services revenue, which reached $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. iPhone revenue hit an all-time record at $69.1 billion, and the installed base of active devices reached over 2.35 billion. Despite challenges such as an 11% decline in Greater China revenue and a 2% decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, the overall financial performance was strong. The positive aspects, including record revenues and EPS, and the well-received Apple Intelligence features, are likely to drive the stock price up. However, concerns about competitive pressures in China and foreign exchange headwinds may temper the rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's integration of AI in its devices, with a focus on personal privacy. The company has launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, which processes data on-device to ensure user privacy. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, with a 6% increase from the previous year. However, the introduction of AI features in the iPhone 16 series did not result in a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI. Despite this, the article suggests that AI is expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion, with Apple being one of the key players in the AI industry. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, due to the long-term potential of AI and Apple's position in the industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported better-than-expected fiscal Q1 results, which is positive news for the company. Typically, such good results lead to increased investor confidence and potential upward pressure on the stock price. However, the broader market trends should also be considered, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up, suggesting a generally positive market sentiment which may also support AAPL's stock price. Therefore, it is probable that the stock price will rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sales trend for Apple iPhones in markets where AI features were implemented, suggesting potential revenue growth. However, the mention of a 'limited rollout' acts as a cautionary note, highlighting that the growth may not be felt universally, particularly in critical markets like China. Additionally, previous predictions are leaning towards a positive outlook on the stock due to overall strong financial performance and investor sentiment driven by Apple's performance. Thus, while there are both positive and negative factors at play, the overall sentiment remains optimistic, with a higher likelihood of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The headline and executive guidance point to a positive sales outlook, driven by iPhone demand, which is reassuring. The company beat EPS and revenue expectations. However, iPhone sales fell short of estimates, and sales in Greater China were significantly down, indicating strong competitive pressures. The positive impact of Apple Intelligence is recognized, but its limited availability tempers enthusiasm. Analysts describe the results as 'mixed.' Previous predictions have been predominantly positive, suggesting that the overall positive outlook is more compelling to investors. Taking these factors into consideration, a rise is the most likely outcome, though the negatives will mitigate that rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive AI-related capital expenditure as a positive, potentially making it less vulnerable to the negative impacts affecting other Big Tech companies, he maintains a 'Hold' rating. This indicates a lack of strong conviction for a significant price movement in either direction.  Uncertainty remains about the impact of AI on iPhone sales and the timing of hardware and software rollouts. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment. Considering the analyst's cautious outlook and the mixed nature of the news,  I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability to both upward and downward movement, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the overall positive sentiment in prior predictions, but acknowledging significant uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's premarket gain of 3.4% following a strong sales growth forecast, which reassures investors about the company's recovery from a dip in iPhone sales. The broader market sentiment is positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising, driven by Apple's performance and anticipation of key inflation data. The positive guidance from Apple's executives and the overall market uplift suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the looming inflation data could introduce some volatility. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a 65-75% chance of an increase. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) Q1 2025 earnings call highlights record revenue and EPS, with positive trends in iPhone, Services, and other segments. Despite challenges in Greater China and Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decline, the overall performance was strong. The introduction of Apple Intelligence has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available. Most predictions from previous rounds suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, citing the positive outlook, record revenues, and EPS. However, concerns about competitive pressures in China and foreign exchange headwinds may temper the rise. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's integration of AI in its devices, with a focus on personal privacy, and reports a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter. Although the introduction of AI features in the iPhone 16 series did not result in a significant sales boost, the long-term potential of AI and Apple's position in the industry are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. Considering the positive outlook on AI's influence across industries, the growing demand for AI-driven data centers, and Apple's efforts to maintain market leadership through AI integration, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s better-than-expected fiscal Q1 results, including record revenue and earnings per share, with strong performance in the Services segment. Despite some challenges in Greater China and a slight dip in Wearables sales, the overall positive outlook from these results, combined with the increasing adoption of AI features, is likely to boost investor confidence and support a potential rise in the stock price. The positive market sentiment also contributes to this view. The majority of previous model predictions indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, suggesting a similar expectation.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.66, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.34, Reasoning: The recent news highlights a positive trend in Apple iPhone sales in areas where AI features have been implemented, indicating potential revenue growth. However, it also mentions limitations due to a 'limited rollout' which could hinder widespread growth. Previous predictions lean toward optimism due to strong overall financial performance, despite concerns about specific markets like China. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise, though tempered by caution regarding the limited uptake of new features.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag, but the market reacted positively in pre-market trading. While iPhone sales missed estimates, the overall sales outlook is rosy, driven by Apple Intelligence (even though its availability is limited). The services unit saw strong growth. Concerns remain about sales in Greater China and the mixed analyst sentiment (DA Davidson). Previous model predictions leaned toward a price rise, suggesting an overall positive market sentiment towards Apple despite some challenges. Considering the positive guidance, the positive pre-market reaction, and the overall sentiment tilting favorably despite some negatives, the probability of a rise is cautiously estimated to be slightly higher. The market's focus on overall sales guidance likely outweighs concerns about China sales. However, the China concerns and mixed analyst report temper the enthusiasm slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's less aggressive AI-related capital expenditure is a positive, potentially making it less vulnerable to the negative impacts affecting other Big Tech companies, the analyst maintains a 'Hold' rating, indicating a lack of strong conviction for a significant price movement in either direction. Uncertainty remains about the impact of AI on iPhone sales and the timing of hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are mostly positive, ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 probability of a price rise, mainly due to strong overall financial performance and positive market sentiment. However, concerns about China market performance and the limited impact of AI integration so far are weighing on the overall outlook. Considering the analyst's cautious outlook and the mixed nature of the news, and the overall trend of previous predictions leaning optimistic, I'm assigning a probability slightly higher than 0.5 for a price rise, reflecting the overall positive market sentiment but acknowledging significant uncertainty.  The previous round's models generally moved towards slightly higher probabilities of a price rise after considering initial results. I have adjusted accordingly by decreasing the probability of a price rise compared to the majority of the earlier predictions while still acknowledging the net positive sentiment. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a 3.4% premarket gain driven by a strong sales growth forecast and investor reassurance about the company's recovery from a dip in iPhone sales. The broader market sentiment is also positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising. However, the looming inflation data could introduce some volatility. Previous predictions from various models generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with estimates ranging from 65% to 75%. The positive guidance from Apple's executives and the overall market uplift suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising, though the inflation data remains a potential downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's integration of AI in its devices, with a focus on personal privacy, and reports a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter. Although the introduction of AI features in the iPhone 16 series did not result in a significant sales boost, the long-term potential of AI and Apple's position in the industry are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is positive, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering the positive outlook on AI's influence across industries, the growing demand for AI-driven data centers, and Apple's efforts to maintain market leadership through AI integration, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s better-than-expected fiscal Q1 results, including record revenue and earnings per share, with strong performance in the Services segment. Despite some challenges in Greater China and a slight dip in Wearables sales, the overall positive outlook from these results, combined with the increasing adoption of AI features, is likely to boost investor confidence and support a potential rise in the stock price. The positive market sentiment also contributes to this view. The majority of previous model predictions indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, suggesting a similar expectation.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.66, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.34, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where AI features were rolled out, which is a positive signal for revenue growth. However, the limited rollout suggests that this growth may not be replicated across all markets, particularly impacting critical areas like China. Previous predictions indicate a generally positive outlook despite challenges, with most forecasts leaning towards a likelihood of stock price increase. The combination of robust financial performance and strong market sentiment, tempered by some concerns about specific markets, leads to a cautious optimism for the stock's upward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. The 'rosy sales outlook' and anticipation of iPhone demand momentum, along with better-than-expected EPS and revenue, suggest a likely price increase. However, the actual iPhone sales falling short of estimates, particularly in the crucial Greater China market, introduces a significant risk. The positive impact and limited availability of 'Apple Intelligence' are also factors balancing potential gains. Considering the mixed analyst sentiment and observations from previous rounds, I will aim for a final prediction in line with decreasing predictions from the previous turns, acknowledging the uncertainties and weighing of positive and negative aspects. Concerns about China are relevant, but overall sales and future outlook seem to have a bigger influence on market, but with a slightly downward trend due to all conflicting signals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive AI-related capital expenditure as a positive, making it less vulnerable to the negative impacts affecting other Big Tech companies, he maintains a 'Hold' rating, indicating uncertainty.  Concerns remain about the mismatch between hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales.  However, previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price rise, mostly due to Apple exceeding revenue and EPS expectations and a positive overall market sentiment.  The consistent positive predictions indicate a robust underlying belief in Apple's long-term prospects, despite the short-term concerns expressed by the analyst.  Therefore, I am weighting my prediction toward the consensus of the previous models, acknowledging the mixed nature of the news and the inherent uncertainty in stock market predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a 3.4% premarket gain following a strong sales growth forecast. This suggests investor confidence in the company's recovery from a dip in iPhone sales, especially with the rollout of AI features. The broader market sentiment is also positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising. However, key inflation data expected later in the day could introduce volatility. Previous predictions from various models generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with estimates ranging from 65% to 75%. Considering the positive guidance from Apple's executives, the premarket gain, and the overall market uplift, the probability of the stock price rising is higher. Nonetheless, the inflation data remains a potential downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) Q1 2025 earnings call highlights record revenue and EPS, with positive trends in iPhone, Services, and other segments. Despite challenges in Greater China and Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decline, the overall performance was strong. The introduction of Apple Intelligence has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available. Most predictions from previous rounds suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, citing the positive outlook, record revenues, and EPS. However, concerns about competitive pressures in China and foreign exchange headwinds may temper the rise.
