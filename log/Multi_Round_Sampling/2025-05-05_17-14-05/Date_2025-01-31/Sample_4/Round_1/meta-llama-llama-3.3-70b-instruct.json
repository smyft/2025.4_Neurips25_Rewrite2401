(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears related to DeepSeek have lessened. CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek suggest that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI. This, along with Apple\u2019s prudent approach to capital spending, could positively influence investor sentiment toward AAPL, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and its potentially more efficient AI models could put pressure on Apple to innovate faster and optimize its AI spending. Tim Cook's response hints at this acknowledgment, but also signals a welcoming of innovations that drive efficiency. This could be interpreted as slightly positive in the long run, implying cost savings and faster innovation cycles if Apple can leverage or adapt similar strategies. However, the news also highlights Apple's ongoing struggles in the Chinese market, where its revenue is down. This is a more immediate and concrete negative factor weighing on the stock. The global AI selloff that DeepSeek triggered did not significantly affect AAPL itself, so the direct impact of DeepSeek is mitigated by Tim Cook's response, but the news is not overwhelmingly positive. Given all these factors, the negative factors outweigh the positive, but not by a very large amount. The probability of a fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst also points to the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and a lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps.  The Stargate initiative, a large AI project unrelated to Apple's direct operations, is mentioned but has mixed signals regarding funding and ultimately doesn't heavily influence the AAPL outlook directly.  The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the analyst downgrade and concerns about AI innovation and iPhone sales. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product line offer some mitigating factors. The probability of a price rise is therefore less than the probability of a price fall, but not drastically so, considering Apple's generally strong performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The earnings report highlights record revenue and EPS, driven by strong performance in the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services segments. The installed base of active devices also reached an all-time high, indicating strong customer loyalty and satisfaction. Positive momentum in emerging markets, particularly India, and the successful introduction of Apple Intelligence features further bolster the company's outlook. However, challenges in Greater China, a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds present notable risks. The overall positive indicators, such as all-time records in multiple segments and robust growth in services, outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the integration of AI into cloud platforms, specifically in the healthcare sector, and mentions several companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article does not provide any company-specific news about Apple. It mentions Apple's stock price fell 0.7% to $237.59 after announcing a cash dividend and reporting increased earnings and revenue. The lack of directly relevant news about Apple's AI or cloud initiatives suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact from this specific article. Given that the article is more focused on other companies' AI advancements, there's a slight inclination towards a potential stock price fall due to the absence of positive momentum from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news report presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the company's prospects. On the positive side, Apple provided a reassuring revenue forecast, with sales expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits, which is in line with analyst predictions. The services division, including the App Store and Apple Music, performed well, with revenue growing 14% to a record $26.3 billion. Additionally, the Mac and iPad lineups exceeded expectations. However, there are concerns about the company's performance in China, where revenue declined 11%, and the wearables, home, and accessories category also saw a decline. Furthermore, Apple faces challenges in competing with local brands in China and is behind its peers in artificial intelligence development. Considering these factors, the stock price may rise due to the positive forecast and strong services revenue, but the challenges in China and AI development may limit the upside. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential. However, concerns over iPhone shipments and market valuation challenges contribute to cautious optimism. Analysts remain optimistic due to resilient margins and cash flows.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
