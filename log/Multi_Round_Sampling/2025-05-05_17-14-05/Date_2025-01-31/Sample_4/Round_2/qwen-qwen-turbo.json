(AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears related to DeepSeek have lessened. CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek suggest that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI. This, along with Apple\u2019s prudent approach to capital spending, could positively influence investor sentiment toward AAPL, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and its potentially more efficient AI models could put pressure on Apple to innovate faster and optimize its AI spending. Tim Cook's response hints at this acknowledgment, but also signals a welcoming of innovations that drive efficiency. This could be interpreted as slightly positive in the long run, implying cost savings and faster innovation cycles if Apple can leverage or adapt similar strategies. However, the news also highlights Apple's ongoing struggles in the Chinese market, where its revenue is down. This is a more immediate and concrete negative factor weighing on the stock. The global AI selloff that DeepSeek triggered did not significantly affect AAPL itself, so the direct impact of DeepSeek is mitigated by Tim Cook's response, but the news is not overwhelmingly positive. Given all these factors, the negative factors outweigh the positive, but not by a very large amount. The probability of a fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst also points to the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and a lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps.  The Stargate initiative, a large AI project unrelated to Apple's direct operations, is mentioned but has mixed signals regarding funding and ultimately doesn't heavily influence the AAPL outlook directly.  The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the analyst downgrade and concerns about AI innovation and iPhone sales. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product line offer some mitigating factors. The probability of a price rise is therefore less than the probability of a price fall, but not drastically so, considering Apple's generally strong performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The earnings report highlights record revenue and EPS, driven by strong performance in the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services segments. The installed base of active devices also reached an all-time high, indicating strong customer loyalty and satisfaction. Positive momentum in emerging markets, particularly India, and the successful introduction of Apple Intelligence features further bolster the company's outlook. However, challenges in Greater China, a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds present notable risks. The overall positive indicators, such as all-time records in multiple segments and robust growth in services, outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the integration of AI into cloud platforms, specifically in the healthcare sector, and mentions several companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article does not provide any company-specific news about Apple. It mentions Apple's stock price fell 0.7% to $237.59 after announcing a cash dividend and reporting increased earnings and revenue. The lack of directly relevant news about Apple's AI or cloud initiatives suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact from this specific article. Given that the article is more focused on other companies' AI advancements, there's a slight inclination towards a potential stock price fall due to the absence of positive momentum from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news report presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the company's prospects. On the positive side, Apple provided a reassuring revenue forecast, with sales expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits, which is in line with analyst predictions. The services division, including the App Store and Apple Music, performed well, with revenue growing 14% to a record $26.3 billion. Additionally, the Mac and iPad lineups exceeded expectations. However, there are concerns about the company's performance in China, where revenue declined 11%, and the wearables, home, and accessories category also saw a decline. Furthermore, Apple faces challenges in competing with local brands in China and is behind its peers in artificial intelligence development. Considering these factors, the stock price may rise due to the positive forecast and strong services revenue, but the challenges in China and AI development may limit the upside. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential. However, concerns over iPhone shipments and market valuation challenges contribute to cautious optimism. Analysts remain optimistic due to resilient margins and cash flows.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears surrounding DeepSeek fade, with Apple CEO Tim Cook viewing DeepSeek optimistically. This suggests that investors may see potential opportunities rather than threats, boosting sentiment toward AAPL. However, some concerns remain about Apple's performance in the Chinese market and the competition in AI. Previous predictions indicate varying sentiments, but the general trend is leaning towards a slight optimism in tech stocks. Taking all factors into account, a balanced view indicates a probability of moderate price rise despite lingering uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the immediate sell-off triggered by DeepSeek didn't significantly impact Apple, the emergence of potentially more efficient AI models from DeepSeek raises questions about Apple's AI spending and innovation pace. Tim Cook's response suggests Apple sees opportunity in driving efficiency, potentially positive in the long-term. However, the continued challenges in the Chinese market, where revenue is down 11% year-over-year, remain a significant concern. Considering previous predictions, Rounds 0 model's show significant variability, focusing on factors like Tim Cook's positive comments, challenges in China, analyst downgrades, and Apple's overall AI capabilities. Taking these factors into account, there's a slightly higher likelihood of a price fall, reflecting concerns in the Chinese markets. However, Apple still has good reputation, and Tim Cook's optimism can to some degree counteract the concerns in the Chinese markets.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate prospects, the Oppenheimer downgrade is significant. The downgrade cites concerns about weakening iPhone sales, a lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market. These are all valid concerns that could negatively impact Apple's stock price.  However, Apple remains a massive and well-established company with a strong brand and diverse product line.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance in the AI space. Considering the negative analyst report and the relatively slow rollout of Apple's AI initiatives compared to competitors, the likelihood of a stock price fall seems slightly higher than a rise, but it's not a drastic difference given Apple's overall strength.  I'm taking into account the inconsistent predictions from previous rounds and weighing them with the current news sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a strong case for Apple Inc. with record revenue and EPS, driven by performance in key segments like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. The installed base of active devices is at an all-time high, and services revenue growth is robust. Positive momentum in emerging markets and the successful introduction of Apple Intelligence features are additional positives. However, challenges in Greater China, a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds are notable negatives. Despite these, the overall positive indicators outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Previous predictions also indicate a leaning towards a rise, with most models favoring an increase despite some concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses the integration of AI in cloud platforms, particularly in the healthcare sector, and mentions Apple's stock performance. Apple's stock price fell 0.7% to $237.59 after announcing a cash dividend and reporting increased earnings and revenue. However, the article does not provide company-specific news about Apple's AI or cloud initiatives. Considering the mixed performance of Apple in various markets and its recent financial reports, there is a cautious optimism due to strong financials but concerns about market challenges. The absence of directly relevant news about Apple's AI or cloud initiatives suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact from this specific article.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the company's prospects.

The predictions from other models also suggest a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Taking into account the mixed news and the range of opinions from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential. However, concerns over iPhone shipments and market valuation challenges contribute to cautious optimism. Analysts remain optimistic due to resilient margins and cash flows.
