A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears related to DeepSeek have lessened. CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek suggest that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI. This, along with Apple\u2019s prudent approach to capital spending, could positively influence investor sentiment toward AAPL, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and its potentially more efficient AI models could put pressure on Apple to innovate faster and optimize its AI spending. Tim Cook's response hints at this acknowledgment, but also signals a welcoming of innovations that drive efficiency. This could be interpreted as slightly positive in the long run, implying cost savings and faster innovation cycles if Apple can leverage or adapt similar strategies. However, the news also highlights Apple's ongoing struggles in the Chinese market, where its revenue is down. This is a more immediate and concrete negative factor weighing on the stock. The global AI selloff that DeepSeek triggered did not significantly affect AAPL itself, so the direct impact of DeepSeek is mitigated by Tim Cook's response, but the news is not overwhelmingly positive. Given all these factors, the negative factors outweigh the positive, but not by a very large amount. The probability of a fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst also points to the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and a lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps.  The Stargate initiative, a large AI project unrelated to Apple's direct operations, is mentioned but has mixed signals regarding funding and ultimately doesn't heavily influence the AAPL outlook directly.  The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the analyst downgrade and concerns about AI innovation and iPhone sales. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product line offer some mitigating factors. The probability of a price rise is therefore less than the probability of a price fall, but not drastically so, considering Apple's generally strong performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The earnings report highlights record revenue and EPS, driven by strong performance in the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services segments. The installed base of active devices also reached an all-time high, indicating strong customer loyalty and satisfaction. Positive momentum in emerging markets, particularly India, and the successful introduction of Apple Intelligence features further bolster the company's outlook. However, challenges in Greater China, a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds present notable risks. The overall positive indicators, such as all-time records in multiple segments and robust growth in services, outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the integration of AI into cloud platforms, specifically in the healthcare sector, and mentions several companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article does not provide any company-specific news about Apple. It mentions Apple's stock price fell 0.7% to $237.59 after announcing a cash dividend and reporting increased earnings and revenue. The lack of directly relevant news about Apple's AI or cloud initiatives suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact from this specific article. Given that the article is more focused on other companies' AI advancements, there's a slight inclination towards a potential stock price fall due to the absence of positive momentum from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news report presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the company's prospects. On the positive side, Apple provided a reassuring revenue forecast, with sales expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits, which is in line with analyst predictions. The services division, including the App Store and Apple Music, performed well, with revenue growing 14% to a record $26.3 billion. Additionally, the Mac and iPad lineups exceeded expectations. However, there are concerns about the company's performance in China, where revenue declined 11%, and the wearables, home, and accessories category also saw a decline. Furthermore, Apple faces challenges in competing with local brands in China and is behind its peers in artificial intelligence development. Considering these factors, the stock price may rise due to the positive forecast and strong services revenue, but the challenges in China and AI development may limit the upside. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential. However, concerns over iPhone shipments and market valuation challenges contribute to cautious optimism. Analysts remain optimistic due to resilient margins and cash flows.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears surrounding DeepSeek fade, with Apple CEO Tim Cook viewing DeepSeek optimistically. This suggests that investors may see potential opportunities rather than threats, boosting sentiment toward AAPL. However, some concerns remain about Apple's performance in the Chinese market and the competition in AI. Previous predictions indicate varying sentiments, but the general trend is leaning towards a slight optimism in tech stocks. Taking all factors into account, a balanced view indicates a probability of moderate price rise despite lingering uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the immediate sell-off triggered by DeepSeek didn't significantly impact Apple, the emergence of potentially more efficient AI models from DeepSeek raises questions about Apple's AI spending and innovation pace. Tim Cook's response suggests Apple sees opportunity in driving efficiency, potentially positive in the long-term. However, the continued challenges in the Chinese market, where revenue is down 11% year-over-year, remain a significant concern. Considering previous predictions, Rounds 0 model's show significant variability, focusing on factors like Tim Cook's positive comments, challenges in China, analyst downgrades, and Apple's overall AI capabilities. Taking these factors into account, there's a slightly higher likelihood of a price fall, reflecting concerns in the Chinese markets. However, Apple still has good reputation, and Tim Cook's optimism can to some degree counteract the concerns in the Chinese markets.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate prospects, the Oppenheimer downgrade is significant. The downgrade cites concerns about weakening iPhone sales, a lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market. These are all valid concerns that could negatively impact Apple's stock price.  However, Apple remains a massive and well-established company with a strong brand and diverse product line.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance in the AI space. Considering the negative analyst report and the relatively slow rollout of Apple's AI initiatives compared to competitors, the likelihood of a stock price fall seems slightly higher than a rise, but it's not a drastic difference given Apple's overall strength.  I'm taking into account the inconsistent predictions from previous rounds and weighing them with the current news sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a strong case for Apple Inc. with record revenue and EPS, driven by performance in key segments like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. The installed base of active devices is at an all-time high, and services revenue growth is robust. Positive momentum in emerging markets and the successful introduction of Apple Intelligence features are additional positives. However, challenges in Greater China, a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds are notable negatives. Despite these, the overall positive indicators outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Previous predictions also indicate a leaning towards a rise, with most models favoring an increase despite some concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses the integration of AI in cloud platforms, particularly in the healthcare sector, and mentions Apple's stock performance. Apple's stock price fell 0.7% to $237.59 after announcing a cash dividend and reporting increased earnings and revenue. However, the article does not provide company-specific news about Apple's AI or cloud initiatives. Considering the mixed performance of Apple in various markets and its recent financial reports, there is a cautious optimism due to strong financials but concerns about market challenges. The absence of directly relevant news about Apple's AI or cloud initiatives suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact from this specific article.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the company's prospects. On the positive side, Apple provided a reassuring revenue forecast, with sales expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits, which is in line with analyst predictions. The services division, including the App Store and Apple Music, performed well, with revenue growing 14% to a record $26.3 billion. Additionally, the Mac and iPad lineups exceeded expectations.

Furthermore, Apple faces challenges in competing with local brands in China and is behind its peers in artificial intelligence development. Considering these factors, the stock price may rise due to the positive forecast and strong services revenue, but the challenges in China and AI development may limit the upside. The predictions from other models also suggest a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Taking into account the mixed news and the range of opinions from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential. However, concerns over iPhone shipments and market valuation challenges contribute to cautious optimism. Analysts remain optimistic due to resilient margins and cash flows. The news presents a mixed tone, but given the overall positive sentiment from Buffett's continued investment and strong financial performance, the probability of a stock price rise is higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears surrounding DeepSeek fade, and Tim Cook's positive outlook suggests that Apple may view competition as an opportunity rather than a threat. While there are lingering concerns about Apple's performance in China and the pace of AI innovation, the overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic following the comments from leadership and the broader positive trend in tech. The probabilities from other analyses reflect a mix of cautious optimism and lingering concerns. This leads to a slightly higher probability of price increase due to the positive sentiment in the tech sector and Apple\u2019s established market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the implications of DeepSeek's competitive AI models on Big Tech, including Apple. While the initial sell-off didn't significantly affect Apple, Tim Cook's comments acknowledging the potential for efficiency gains are a positive sign. However, the company's challenges in China, as highlighted in the article, remain concerning. Considering previous models' predictions, a trend emerges; the models recognize these opposing forces (China challenges vs AI optimism). Most models are leaning towards a greater probability of a fall overall in Round 1. I acknowledge Tim Cook's positivity around AI, and the ability for Apple to extract value from these innovations. That said, the Chinese market represents an important variable, and a persistent headwind for Apple's outlook. Therefore I am factoring this more heavily, and predicting a slightly higher probability in fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  While the Oppenheimer downgrade is a significant negative, citing concerns about weakening iPhone sales, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market,  it's important to consider Apple's overall strength and resilience.  The analyst's concerns are valid but don't necessarily paint a catastrophic picture of Apple's future.  The Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's short-term prospects.  Previous predictions show significant divergence, reflecting the uncertainty.  The downgrade significantly outweighs the vague positives within the article.  Furthermore, the continued focus on AI innovation by competitors puts pressure on Apple to respond effectively, adding to the uncertainty. Considering the negativity of the Oppenheimer downgrade and the lack of compelling positive news specific to AAPL, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, though I acknowledge the potential for resilience given Apple's track record and market dominance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a strong performance with record revenue and EPS, driven by key segments like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. The installed base of active devices is at an all-time high, and services revenue growth is robust. Positive momentum in emerging markets, particularly India, and the successful introduction of Apple Intelligence features further bolster the company's outlook. However, challenges in Greater China, a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds present notable risks. The overall positive indicators, such as all-time records in multiple segments and robust growth in services, outweigh the negatives. Previous predictions also indicate a leaning towards a rise, with most models favoring an increase despite some concerns. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

The news presents a mixed tone, but given the overall positive sentiment from Buffett's continued investment and strong financial performance, the probability of a stock price rise is higher.
