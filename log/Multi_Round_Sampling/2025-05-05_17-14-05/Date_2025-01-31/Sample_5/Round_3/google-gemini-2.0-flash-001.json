Here's what the CEOs of Apple, Meta and Microsoft are saying\nNews Content: The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights macroeconomic factors affecting the stock market, particularly the rise in inflation as indicated by the personal consumption and expenditures index. This could lead to increased market volatility and pressure on stocks, including Apple Inc. Additionally, the mention of tariffs under former President Trump adds uncertainty, which could negatively impact stock prices. However, Apple and Nvidia's ability to break key levels may suggest resilience in their stock prices, potentially leading to stability or even increases. Balancing the general market trend driven by inflation concerns and the company-specific news, the probabilities are estimated.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). The emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of Apple's AI investments. Tim Cook's response is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the potential benefits of improved efficiency. However, Apple's existing challenges in China, with revenue down 11% year over year, add a layer of complexity. Overall, the news isn't strongly positive or negative for Apple's stock. While DeepSeek could pressure Apple to innovate more efficiently, the company is already facing headwinds in a crucial market. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a small stock price decrease due to the combination of AI competition and pre-existing issues in China.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive overall sentiment for tech stocks, with the initial fear surrounding DeepSeek's AI model fading.  Apple, a major tech company, is specifically mentioned with its CEO offering a positive assessment of the situation and highlighting a 'prudent' approach to spending. While Cook's comments don't explicitly guarantee a rise in Apple's stock price, they contribute to a generally improved market outlook for the tech sector, reducing the risk of further significant declines. The news suggests a rebound from previous losses related to DeepSeek's emergence, rather than suggesting fundamentally new positive drivers for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly high given the sentiment is cautiously optimistic rather than strongly bullish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model. Analyst Tom Forte highlights that Apple is less vulnerable to competitive threats like DeepSeek due to its ability to leverage others' CapEx spending, unlike competitors such as Meta and Microsoft. However, Forte maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, expressing uncertainty about a potential iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. The mixed sentiment\u2014positive on Apple's CapEx strategy but cautious on near-term growth\u2014suggests neutral to slightly negative market reaction. The probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the lack of clear catalysts (e.g., no super-cycle confirmation), while the probability of a fall is slight due to the Hold rating and competitive concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly impact its stock price. The article mentions a general sector update about tech stocks being mixed, but it does not provide any company-specific news or updates about AAPL. Therefore, I assume that the news is neutral and has no significant impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which helped boost shares of the company. Despite mixed holiday results, including jarring declines for China and the iPhone, the company's revenue forecast and growth in services revenue were positive factors. However, the company still faces challenges in China, AI development, and potential tariffs. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling due to the positive revenue forecast and growth in services revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses, which is seen as a setback in their efforts to create consumer-friendly headsets. This cancellation might negatively impact investor sentiment given the ongoing slow sales and limited usage of the existing Vision Pro headset. The market may see this as a sign of challenges in developing new and innovative products, potentially reducing confidence in future growth prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The financial news indicates macroeconomic pressures with rising inflation and the impact of tariffs, adding uncertainty to the market. Apple is mentioned alongside other tech companies like Nvidia, suggesting some resilience in a challenging environment. However, there are mixed sentiments about the broader tech sector, and concerns about competition from AI innovations and specific challenges in China persist. Overall, while these factors contribute to volatility and could pressure Apple's stock, the company's ability to maintain key levels may provide some support. Thus, I estimate a slightly higher probability of falling due to the broader concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While DeepSeek's emergence initially caused a tech stock sell-off, Tim Cook's response is cautiously optimistic, suggesting that innovations driving efficiency are a good thing. This indicates a somewhat neutral stance, with Apple acknowledging the potential benefits of the AI model. However, Apple's existing issues in China, with revenue down 11% year over year, create uncertainty. Despite this challanges, Apple stock avoided the initial DeepSeek sell-off, indicating relative resilience. Considering these factors, the chances of a rise and a fall are somewhat evenly balanced. The previous rounds of predictions from other models are highly variable. Some predict a higher chance of a fall because of the China headwinds, while others were a higher chance of a rise due to the 'reassuring' revenue forecast, indicating there isn't a specific consensus. Weighing these factors and taking into account Tim Cook's comments, the stock may experience a slight upward bias.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple and the tech sector.  The fading fears around DeepSeek's AI model suggest reduced market volatility, which benefits established players like Apple. Tim Cook's positive comments and mention of prudent capital spending further contribute to a positive outlook. However, the news lacks strong, specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. The overall market sentiment is improving, but this is a generalized effect rather than something unique to Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions. Some models emphasize the potential for negative impacts (competition, China market challenges), while others focus on the general market rebound and Apple's resilience.  Weighing the generally favorable news with the lack of specific positive drivers for Apple and the mixed opinions from other models, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but it remains relatively modest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model, which makes it less vulnerable to competitive threats like DeepSeek. Analyst Tom Forte maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, expressing uncertainty about a potential iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. While the hybrid CapEx model is a positive, the lack of clear catalysts (e.g., no super-cycle confirmation) and the Hold rating suggest a neutral to slightly negative market reaction. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a slight decline due to competitive concerns and lack of strong positive drivers. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news provides mixed results for Apple Inc., with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, growth in services revenue, and record profit. However, the company faces challenges in China, with an 11% decline in revenue, and struggles in AI development. The cancellation of a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses is also seen as a setback. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling due to the mixed results and ongoing challenges. The previous predictions from other models indicate a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a rise and others to a fall. Taking into account the mixed sentiment and challenges, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.42 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses, which is seen as a setback in their efforts to create consumer-friendly headsets. This cancellation might negatively impact investor sentiment given the ongoing slow sales and limited usage of the existing Vision Pro headset. The market may see this as a sign of challenges in developing new and innovative products, potentially reducing confidence in future growth prospects. Additionally, the fact that other technology companies face similar difficulties in achieving breakthroughs in AR and mixed reality may not provide a strong comparative advantage for Apple.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple includes macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and uncertainty stemming from tariffs, which could exert downward pressure on stock prices. However, the mention of Apple alongside other tech firms indicates some resilience from its notable performance and its capability to maintain key levels despite challenging market conditions. The mixed perspectives from previous predictions suggest that while there are significant challenges particularly related to competition in AI and the situation in China, the overall sentiment related to tech stocks has slightly improved. Therefore, I estimate a modest probability for a rise due to the resilient aspects of Apple's business and a somewhat higher probability for a fall attributable to macroeconomic concerns and intensified competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple. While Tim Cook views innovation driving efficiency positively, suggesting a neutral-to-positive response to DeepSeek, Apple is also dealing with a revenue decline in China. The impact of DeepSeek itself isn't definitive, as Zuckerberg noted the need to 'digest' their innovations. Other models in previous rounds show diverging opinions, factoring in aspects from China challenges to reassuring revenue forecasts, lack of clear catalysts. Factoring in the China revenue decreases and potential pressures from changing capital expenditure approaches, the stock shows a slightly higher probability of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is primarily positive for Apple and the tech sector in general. The easing of concerns about DeepSeek's AI model suggests reduced market volatility, benefiting established players like Apple. Cook's positive comments and prudent spending approach further enhance this positive outlook. However, the news lacks strong, company-specific catalysts for a significant price surge in Apple stock. The positive sentiment is more of a general market effect rather than something unique to Apple's performance.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals considerable divergence, highlighting uncertainty.  Some models correctly point out persistent challenges, such as underperformance in China and competition in AI.  Weighing the generally positive market trend with the absence of specific Apple-related positive drivers, and considering the mixed prior predictions, a slightly higher chance of a price rise than a fall is assigned, but the probabilities remain close to even.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model, which makes it less vulnerable to competitive threats like DeepSeek. Analyst Tom Forte maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, expressing uncertainty about a potential iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. While the hybrid CapEx model is a positive, the lack of clear catalysts (e.g., no super-cycle confirmation) and the Hold rating suggest a neutral to slightly negative market reaction. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a slight decline due to competitive concerns and lack of strong positive drivers. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for tech stocks, with no specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly impact its stock price. The general sector update mentions tech stocks being mixed, but does not provide any company-specific news or updates about AAPL. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions from previous models, I estimate that the stock price movement probabilities remain relatively balanced. However, given the lack of specific positive drivers for Apple's stock and the general market trend, I assign a slightly higher probability to a potential stock price rise due to resilience in tech stocks but also consider the challenges faced by Apple, such as competition and macroeconomic factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, growth in services revenue, and record profit. However, the company faces challenges in China, with an 11% decline in revenue, and struggles in AI development. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.48 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.52. The mixed results and ongoing challenges contribute to a relatively balanced probability assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple scrapping a significant project focused on augmented reality glasses, which represents a notable setback in their innovation efforts. This decision adds to concerns regarding the market acceptance of their existing Vision Pro headset, currently facing slower-than-expected sales and usage. The cancellation indicates potential challenges in developing new, consumer-friendly products, potentially eroding investor confidence in Apple's growth prospects. Other predictive models provided a mix of probabilities, with many models indicating a higher likelihood of stock price falling due to negative sentiments about ongoing challenges, particularly in the Chinese market and in AI development.
