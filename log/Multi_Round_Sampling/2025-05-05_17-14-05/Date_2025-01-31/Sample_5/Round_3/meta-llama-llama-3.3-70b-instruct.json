(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights macroeconomic factors affecting the stock market, particularly the rise in inflation as indicated by the personal consumption and expenditures index. This could lead to increased market volatility and pressure on stocks, including Apple Inc. Additionally, the mention of tariffs under former President Trump adds uncertainty, which could negatively impact stock prices. However, Apple and Nvidia's ability to break key levels may suggest resilience in their stock prices, potentially leading to stability or even increases. Balancing the general market trend driven by inflation concerns and the company-specific news, the probabilities are estimated.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). The emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of Apple's AI investments. Tim Cook's response is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the potential benefits of improved efficiency. However, Apple's existing challenges in China, with revenue down 11% year over year, add a layer of complexity. Overall, the news isn't strongly positive or negative for Apple's stock. While DeepSeek could pressure Apple to innovate more efficiently, the company is already facing headwinds in a crucial market. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a small stock price decrease due to the combination of AI competition and pre-existing issues in China.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive overall sentiment for tech stocks, with the initial fear surrounding DeepSeek's AI model fading.  Apple, a major tech company, is specifically mentioned with its CEO offering a positive assessment of the situation and highlighting a 'prudent' approach to spending. While Cook's comments don't explicitly guarantee a rise in Apple's stock price, they contribute to a generally improved market outlook for the tech sector, reducing the risk of further significant declines. The news suggests a rebound from previous losses related to DeepSeek's emergence, rather than suggesting fundamentally new positive drivers for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly high given the sentiment is cautiously optimistic rather than strongly bullish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model. Analyst Tom Forte highlights that Apple is less vulnerable to competitive threats like DeepSeek due to its ability to leverage others' CapEx spending, unlike competitors such as Meta and Microsoft. However, Forte maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, expressing uncertainty about a potential iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. The mixed sentiment\u2014positive on Apple's CapEx strategy but cautious on near-term growth\u2014suggests neutral to slightly negative market reaction. The probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the lack of clear catalysts (e.g., no super-cycle confirmation), while the probability of a fall is slight due to the Hold rating and competitive concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly impact its stock price. The article mentions a general sector update about tech stocks being mixed, but it does not provide any company-specific news or updates about AAPL. Therefore, I assume that the news is neutral and has no significant impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which helped boost shares of the company. Despite mixed holiday results, including jarring declines for China and the iPhone, the company's revenue forecast and growth in services revenue were positive factors. However, the company still faces challenges in China, AI development, and potential tariffs. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling due to the positive revenue forecast and growth in services revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses, which is seen as a setback in their efforts to create consumer-friendly headsets. This cancellation might negatively impact investor sentiment given the ongoing slow sales and limited usage of the existing Vision Pro headset. The market may see this as a sign of challenges in developing new and innovative products, potentially reducing confidence in future growth prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The financial news indicates macroeconomic pressures with rising inflation and the impact of tariffs, adding uncertainty to the market. Apple is mentioned alongside other tech companies like Nvidia, suggesting some resilience in a challenging environment. However, there are mixed sentiments about the broader tech sector, and concerns about competition from AI innovations and specific challenges in China persist. Overall, while these factors contribute to volatility and could pressure Apple's stock, the company's ability to maintain key levels may provide some support. Thus, I estimate a slightly higher probability of falling due to the broader concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While DeepSeek's emergence initially caused a tech stock sell-off, Tim Cook's response is cautiously optimistic, suggesting that innovations driving efficiency are a good thing. This indicates a somewhat neutral stance, with Apple acknowledging the potential benefits of the AI model. However, Apple's existing issues in China, with revenue down 11% year over year, create uncertainty. Despite this challanges, Apple stock avoided the initial DeepSeek sell-off, indicating relative resilience. Considering these factors, the chances of a rise and a fall are somewhat evenly balanced. The previous rounds of predictions from other models are highly variable. Some predict a higher chance of a fall because of the China headwinds, while others were a higher chance of a rise due to the 'reassuring' revenue forecast, indicating there isn't a specific consensus. Weighing these factors and taking into account Tim Cook's comments, the stock may experience a slight upward bias.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple and the tech sector.  The fading fears around DeepSeek's AI model suggest reduced market volatility, which benefits established players like Apple. Tim Cook's positive comments and mention of prudent capital spending further contribute to a positive outlook. However, the news lacks strong, specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. The overall market sentiment is improving, but this is a generalized effect rather than something unique to Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions. Some models emphasize the potential for negative impacts (competition, China market challenges), while others focus on the general market rebound and Apple's resilience.  Weighing the generally favorable news with the lack of specific positive drivers for Apple and the mixed opinions from other models, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but it remains relatively modest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model, which makes it less vulnerable to competitive threats like DeepSeek. Analyst Tom Forte maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, expressing uncertainty about a potential iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. While the hybrid CapEx model is a positive, the lack of clear catalysts (e.g., no super-cycle confirmation) and the Hold rating suggest a neutral to slightly negative market reaction. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a slight decline due to competitive concerns and lack of strong positive drivers. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news provides mixed results for Apple Inc., with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, growth in services revenue, and record profit. However, the company faces challenges in China, with an 11% decline in revenue, and struggles in AI development. The cancellation of a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses is also seen as a setback. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling due to the mixed results and ongoing challenges. The previous predictions from other models indicate a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a rise and others to a fall. Taking into account the mixed sentiment and challenges, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.42 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses, which is seen as a setback in their efforts to create consumer-friendly headsets. This cancellation might negatively impact investor sentiment given the ongoing slow sales and limited usage of the existing Vision Pro headset. The market may see this as a sign of challenges in developing new and innovative products, potentially reducing confidence in future growth prospects. Additionally, the fact that other technology companies face similar difficulties in achieving breakthroughs in AR and mixed reality may not provide a strong comparative advantage for Apple.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple includes macroeconomic pressures such as rising inflation and uncertainty stemming from tariffs, which could exert downward pressure on stock prices. However, the mention of Apple alongside other tech firms indicates some resilience from its notable performance and its capability to maintain key levels despite challenging market conditions. The mixed perspectives from previous predictions suggest that while there are significant challenges particularly related to competition in AI and the situation in China, the overall sentiment related to tech stocks has slightly improved. Therefore, I estimate a modest probability for a rise due to the resilient aspects of Apple's business and a somewhat higher probability for a fall attributable to macroeconomic concerns and intensified competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple. While Tim Cook views innovation driving efficiency positively, suggesting a neutral-to-positive response to DeepSeek, Apple is also dealing with a revenue decline in China. The impact of DeepSeek itself isn't definitive, as Zuckerberg noted the need to 'digest' their innovations. Other models in previous rounds show diverging opinions, factoring in aspects from China challenges to reassuring revenue forecasts, lack of clear catalysts. Factoring in the China revenue decreases and potential pressures from changing capital expenditure approaches, the stock shows a slightly higher probability of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is primarily positive for Apple and the tech sector in general. The easing of concerns about DeepSeek's AI model suggests reduced market volatility, benefiting established players like Apple. Cook's positive comments and prudent spending approach further enhance this positive outlook. However, the news lacks strong, company-specific catalysts for a significant price surge in Apple stock. The positive sentiment is more of a general market effect rather than something unique to Apple's performance.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals considerable divergence, highlighting uncertainty.  Some models correctly point out persistent challenges, such as underperformance in China and competition in AI.  Weighing the generally positive market trend with the absence of specific Apple-related positive drivers, and considering the mixed prior predictions, a slightly higher chance of a price rise than a fall is assigned, but the probabilities remain close to even.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model, which makes it less vulnerable to competitive threats like DeepSeek. Analyst Tom Forte maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, expressing uncertainty about a potential iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. While the hybrid CapEx model is a positive, the lack of clear catalysts (e.g., no super-cycle confirmation) and the Hold rating suggest a neutral to slightly negative market reaction. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a slight decline due to competitive concerns and lack of strong positive drivers. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for tech stocks, with no specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly impact its stock price. The general sector update mentions tech stocks being mixed, but does not provide any company-specific news or updates about AAPL. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions from previous models, I estimate that the stock price movement probabilities remain relatively balanced. However, given the lack of specific positive drivers for Apple's stock and the general market trend, I assign a slightly higher probability to a potential stock price rise due to resilience in tech stocks but also consider the challenges faced by Apple, such as competition and macroeconomic factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, growth in services revenue, and record profit. However, the company faces challenges in China, with an 11% decline in revenue, and struggles in AI development. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.48 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.52. The mixed results and ongoing challenges contribute to a relatively balanced probability assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple scrapping a significant project focused on augmented reality glasses, which represents a notable setback in their innovation efforts. This decision adds to concerns regarding the market acceptance of their existing Vision Pro headset, currently facing slower-than-expected sales and usage. The cancellation indicates potential challenges in developing new, consumer-friendly products, potentially eroding investor confidence in Apple's growth prospects. Other predictive models provided a mix of probabilities, with many models indicating a higher likelihood of stock price falling due to negative sentiments about ongoing challenges, particularly in the Chinese market and in AI development. Given these points, the news paints a picture of continued execution challenges and potential future setbacks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
