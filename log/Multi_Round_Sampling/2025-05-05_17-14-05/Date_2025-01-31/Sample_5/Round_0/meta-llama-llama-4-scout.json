(AAPL) that could directly impact its stock price. The article mentions a general sector update about tech stocks being mixed, but it does not provide any company-specific news or updates about AAPL. Therefore, I assume that the news is neutral and has no significant impact on AAPL's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Sector Update: Tech Stocks Mixed in Late Afternoon\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```\n\nNote that I've assumed a neutral impact from the news, which suggests that the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are equal. In a real-world scenario, you would want to consider additional factors such as market trends, recent company performance, and other news events that could impact the stock price. However, based solely on the provided information, I've made a simple estimate."
