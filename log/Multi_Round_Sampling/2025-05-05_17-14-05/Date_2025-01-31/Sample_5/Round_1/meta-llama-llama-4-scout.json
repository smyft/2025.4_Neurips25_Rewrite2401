      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights macroeconomic factors affecting the stock market, particularly the rise in inflation as indicated by the personal consumption and expenditures index. This could lead to increased market volatility and pressure on stocks, including Apple Inc. Additionally, the mention of tariffs under former President Trump adds uncertainty, which could negatively impact stock prices. However, Apple and Nvidia's ability to break key levels may suggest resilience in their stock prices, potentially leading to stability or even increases. Balancing the general market trend driven by inflation concerns and the company-specific news, the probabilities are estimated.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). The emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of Apple's AI investments. Tim Cook's response is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the potential benefits of improved efficiency. However, Apple's existing challenges in China, with revenue down 11% year over year, add a layer of complexity. Overall, the news isn't strongly positive or negative for Apple's stock. While DeepSeek could pressure Apple to innovate more efficiently, the company is already facing headwinds in a crucial market. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a small stock price decrease due to the combination of AI competition and pre-existing issues in China.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive overall sentiment for tech stocks, with the initial fear surrounding DeepSeek's AI model fading.  Apple, a major tech company, is specifically mentioned with its CEO offering a positive assessment of the situation and highlighting a 'prudent' approach to spending. While Cook's comments don't explicitly guarantee a rise in Apple's stock price, they contribute to a generally improved market outlook for the tech sector, reducing the risk of further significant declines. The news suggests a rebound from previous losses related to DeepSeek's emergence, rather than suggesting fundamentally new positive drivers for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly high given the sentiment is cautiously optimistic rather than strongly bullish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model. Analyst Tom Forte highlights that Apple is less vulnerable to competitive threats like DeepSeek due to its ability to leverage others' CapEx spending, unlike competitors such as Meta and Microsoft. However, Forte maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, expressing uncertainty about a potential iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. The mixed sentiment\u2014positive on Apple's CapEx strategy but cautious on near-term growth\u2014suggests neutral to slightly negative market reaction. The probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the lack of clear catalysts (e.g., no super-cycle confirmation), while the probability of a fall is slight due to the Hold rating and competitive concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly impact its stock price. The article mentions a general sector update about tech stocks being mixed, but it does not provide any company-specific news or updates about AAPL. Therefore, I assume that the news is neutral and has no significant impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which helped boost shares of the company. Despite mixed holiday results, including jarring declines for China and the iPhone, the company's revenue forecast and growth in services revenue were positive factors. However, the company still faces challenges in China, AI development, and potential tariffs. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling due to the positive revenue forecast and growth in services revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses, which is seen as a setback in their efforts to create consumer-friendly headsets. This cancellation might negatively impact investor sentiment given the ongoing slow sales and limited usage of the existing Vision Pro headset. The market may see this as a sign of challenges in developing new and innovative products, potentially reducing confidence in future growth prospects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
