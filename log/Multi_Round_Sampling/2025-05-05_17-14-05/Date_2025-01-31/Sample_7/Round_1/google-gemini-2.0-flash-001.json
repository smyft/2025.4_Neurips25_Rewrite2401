(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How Apple can 'leverage' Big Tech players' AI spending\nNews Content: Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to examine Apple's (AAPL) earnings print, analyzing what the results signal about a possible iPhone upgrade cycle and where Apple stands in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\n\"If we've learned anything from the last two quarters, September and December, from Apple, it's that mismatch in the timing of the hardware rollout ... and the software rollout ... has weighed on iPhone sales,\" Forte says.\n\nHe explains his Hold rating on Apple stock, noting, \"It isn't clear to me yet that we're going to get this super-cycle, or much less an upgrade cycle from AI.\"\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek negatively impacted several Big Tech names, such as Nvidia (NVDA). Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The headline suggests that while Apple's stock is currently seeing a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, the long-term impact of AI advancements is uncertain as it is not yet driving significant consumer upgrades to iPhones. This indicates cautious optimism rather than strong upward momentum. As a result, I estimate a moderate probability of rising stock price due to short-term market reactions, but also a notable risk of decline as the initial excitement wanes.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollout could negatively impact iPhone sales, leading analyst Tom Forte to maintain a \"Hold\" rating and express uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. However, the article also highlights Apple's less vulnerable position in the AI race due to its hybrid capital expenditure model, allowing it to leverage the investments of other Big Tech players while spending less itself. This could be seen as a positive factor, mitigating the threat from rising AI companies. The downgraded ratings earlier in the week might put extra pressure on Apple. Considering these factors, the stock is likely to have a slightly higher probability of a slight fall, though news is fairly neutral overall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is positive overall, showing that AI features are boosting iPhone sales in the markets where they've been implemented.  However, the caveat that the rollout has been 'limited' suggests that the positive impact is currently constrained.  This limits the bullish impact.  While the positive effect of AI-driven sales growth is significant, its impact is mitigated by the limited rollout. Therefore, a moderate rise in stock price is more likely than a significant rise or a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast, which has already led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. This positive sentiment is further supported by Deutsche Bank analysts' reassurance regarding revenue growth expectations. Additionally, the broader market context includes rising U.S. stock index futures, which could further buoy Apple's stock. However, the looming inflation data release introduces some uncertainty, as it could influence Federal Reserve policy decisions. Despite this, the immediate reaction to Apple's earnings and guidance is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks are mixed in late afternoon trading. This suggests a neutral or mixed market sentiment for tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is no specific information in the headline or content that directly suggests a significant positive or negative impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the probability of the stock price rising or falling is roughly equal, with a slight inclination towards a neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance. This positive earnings surprise and upbeat outlook typically lead to an increase in stock price. Therefore, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook on Apple's sales, particularly the iPhone sales momentum, which has exceeded expectations despite a slight decline in the holiday quarter. The cautious approach towards AI and its potential benefits have also positively impacted investor sentiment. Moreover, the overall revenue and earnings have beaten the estimates, offsetting the concern over lower iPhone sales in some regions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
