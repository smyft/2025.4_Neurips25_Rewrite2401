      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: How Apple can 'leverage' Big Tech players' AI spending\nNews Content: Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to examine Apple's (AAPL) earnings print, analyzing what the results signal about a possible iPhone upgrade cycle and where Apple stands in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\n\"If we've learned anything from the last two quarters, September and December, from Apple, it's that mismatch in the timing of the hardware rollout ... and the software rollout ... has weighed on iPhone sales,\" Forte says.\n\nHe explains his Hold rating on Apple stock, noting, \"It isn't clear to me yet that we're going to get this super-cycle, or much less an upgrade cycle from AI.\"\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek negatively impacted several Big Tech names, such as Nvidia (NVDA). Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The headline suggests that while Apple's stock is currently seeing a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, the long-term impact of AI advancements is uncertain as it is not yet driving significant consumer upgrades to iPhones. This indicates cautious optimism rather than strong upward momentum. As a result, I estimate a moderate probability of rising stock price due to short-term market reactions, but also a notable risk of decline as the initial excitement wanes.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollout could negatively impact iPhone sales, leading analyst Tom Forte to maintain a \"Hold\" rating and express uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. However, the article also highlights Apple's less vulnerable position in the AI race due to its hybrid capital expenditure model, allowing it to leverage the investments of other Big Tech players while spending less itself. This could be seen as a positive factor, mitigating the threat from rising AI companies. The downgraded ratings earlier in the week might put extra pressure on Apple. Considering these factors, the stock is likely to have a slightly higher probability of a slight fall, though news is fairly neutral overall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is positive overall, showing that AI features are boosting iPhone sales in the markets where they've been implemented.  However, the caveat that the rollout has been 'limited' suggests that the positive impact is currently constrained.  This limits the bullish impact.  While the positive effect of AI-driven sales growth is significant, its impact is mitigated by the limited rollout. Therefore, a moderate rise in stock price is more likely than a significant rise or a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast, which has already led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. This positive sentiment is further supported by Deutsche Bank analysts' reassurance regarding revenue growth expectations. Additionally, the broader market context includes rising U.S. stock index futures, which could further buoy Apple's stock. However, the looming inflation data release introduces some uncertainty, as it could influence Federal Reserve policy decisions. Despite this, the immediate reaction to Apple's earnings and guidance is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks are mixed in late afternoon trading. This suggests a neutral or mixed market sentiment for tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is no specific information in the headline or content that directly suggests a significant positive or negative impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the probability of the stock price rising or falling is roughly equal, with a slight inclination towards a neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance. This positive earnings surprise and upbeat outlook typically lead to an increase in stock price. Therefore, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook on Apple's sales, particularly the iPhone sales momentum, which has exceeded expectations despite a slight decline in the holiday quarter. The cautious approach towards AI and its potential benefits have also positively impacted investor sentiment. Moreover, the overall revenue and earnings have beaten the estimates, offsetting the concern over lower iPhone sales in some regions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that while there is a temporary boost to Apple's stock due to the DeepSeek news, the long-term impact of AI advancements on iPhone upgrades remains uncertain. The consensus among previous predictions reflects a mixed sentiment, with some indicating a slight possibility of a rise due to short-term excitement while others express concerns over the mismatch between AI developments and product upgrades, leading to potential declines. Given the various predictions observed, my estimate reflects a cautious optimism, balancing short-term excitement against the backdrop of longer-term uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple. Analyst Tom Forte's 'Hold' rating and concerns about the AI upgrade cycle initially suggest potential downside. However, Apple's capital expenditure strategy, leveraging other companies' investments, positions them favorably in the AI race, mitigating risks compared to companies like Meta and Microsoft. The analyst believes DeepSeek poses less of a threat to Apple and the previous rounds demonstrate volatility with overall positive recent predictions. Based on this information and previous rounds predictions being more bullish, I marginally expect Apple to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is positive but tempered.  While AI features are boosting iPhone sales in some markets, the limited rollout is a significant caveat. This suggests a positive impact, but not a dramatically positive one. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with several leaning towards a rise (0.7, 0.75, 0.6, 0.8) and others more neutral or slightly bearish (0.5, 0.55, 0.4).  Considering the mixed signals within the news itself and the divergence in previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price increase is warranted. The limited rollout suggests the positive impact is currently constrained and might not be sufficient to drive a significant price surge.  The risk of a decline is also present, as the market might react negatively to the limited AI feature rollout and fail to see it as a major catalyst for growth. Therefore, a probability closer to the mean of previous predictions is justified.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast, which has already led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. This positive sentiment is further supported by Deutsche Bank analysts' reassurance regarding revenue growth expectations. Additionally, the broader market context includes rising U.S. stock index futures, which could further buoy Apple's stock. However, the looming inflation data release introduces some uncertainty, as it could influence Federal Reserve policy decisions. Despite this, the immediate reaction to Apple's earnings and guidance is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise. Previous predictions also indicate a generally positive outlook, with most models favoring a rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates a mixed performance for tech stocks in late Friday afternoon trading. There is no specific information given about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the news content, but based on previous predictions and general market trends, we can infer that the mixed performance of tech stocks might lead to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Several previous predictions suggest a generally positive outlook for AAPL due to factors like better-than-expected earnings, solid growth guidance, and positive sentiment around AI features boosting iPhone sales. However, others also mention uncertainty and potential negative impacts from downgraded ratings and limited rollout of AI features. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a relatively lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which is typically a positive catalyst for stock price growth. Additionally, the majority of previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with some models citing the positive impact of AI-driven sales growth and strong sales growth forecasts. However, some models also mention the potential for uncertainty and mixed market sentiment, which could slightly temper the upward momentum. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the majority of previous predictions, I estimate a moderately high probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on Apple's sales, particularly the iPhone sales momentum, which has exceeded expectations despite a slight decline in the holiday quarter. The cautious approach towards AI and its potential benefits have also positively impacted investor sentiment. Moreover, the overall revenue and earnings have beaten the estimates, offsetting the concern over lower iPhone sales in some regions. Although there are some regional concerns and mixed signals, the general tone of the news is optimistic with a rosier sales outlook, which typically leads to an increase in stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis of the news surrounding Apple Inc. highlights a temporary boost to the stock due to positive sentiment around AI developments and sales forecasts. However, the commentary on the limited impact of AI on driving significant iPhone upgrades leads to a cautious outlook. Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiment among analysts, with several indicating a potential for a slight rise, buoyed by strong earnings and market conditions, while others express concerns over the AI rollout and its implications. Balancing the optimistic sales outlook with the uncertainties mentioned, I estimate a slightly higher probability of rising stock prices than falling ones.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a nuanced view of Apple's position regarding AI. While analyst Forte expresses reservations about an immediate upgrade cycle driven by AI, he also notes Apple's advantageous capital expenditure model, which allows it to leverage the investments of other tech giants. This suggests a degree of resilience against the risks associated with large AI investments. The analyst maintains a Hold rating, signaling neutrality. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, there is a general tendency for a moderately positive outlook, but also with considerable deviations. It seems appropriate to place slightly more emphasis on a small potential upside, due to the relatively favorable position of the company in navigating the AI boom. Also considering a previous downgraded rating might lead to some negative effect overall. I will reduce my prediction of rising comparing to other models' prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is positive but contains a significant caveat.  While AI features are boosting iPhone sales where implemented, the limited rollout restricts the overall positive impact. This creates a mixed outlook. Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a range of opinions, with a slight majority leaning towards a price increase.  Models citing the positive impact of AI-driven sales, strong sales forecasts and better-than-expected earnings largely predict a rise. However, those emphasizing uncertainty around the limited rollout and potential mismatch between AI advancements and product upgrades predict a fall or remain neutral. Considering both the news itself and the varying predictions, a moderately positive outlook is justified, but the limited rollout prevents an overwhelmingly bullish prediction.  The probability is weighted more towards a rise due to the positive sales impact, but a significant fall is less probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to a strong sales growth forecast and a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. Analysts from Deutsche Bank have also expressed reassurance regarding revenue growth expectations. However, the looming inflation data release introduces some uncertainty, which could influence Federal Reserve policy decisions and market sentiment. Previous predictions from other models generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with some citing the positive impact of AI-driven sales growth and strong earnings. Despite the potential for short-term volatility due to inflation data, the immediate reaction to Apple's earnings and guidance is overwhelmingly positive. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates a mixed performance for tech stocks in late Friday afternoon trading, with no specific information about Apple Inc.

However, others also mention uncertainty and potential negative impacts from downgraded ratings and limited rollout of AI features. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a relatively lower probability of it falling. The overall sentiment seems to lean slightly positive, with several models predicting a higher chance of a rise (ranging from 0.55 to 0.8) compared to a fall (ranging from 0.2 to 0.45).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which is typically a positive catalyst for stock price growth. The majority of previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with some models citing the positive impact of AI-driven sales growth and strong sales growth forecasts. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the majority of previous predictions, I estimate a moderately high probability of the stock price rising due to this news. However, some models also mention the potential for uncertainty and mixed market sentiment, which could slightly temper the upward momentum.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights a temporary boost in Apple's stock attributed to the positive sentiment surrounding AI developments. However, the article indicates a caution regarding the limited impact of AI on driving significant upgrades to iPhones. Previous predictions show a varied outlook, with some indicating a higher probability of rising stock prices due to positive sales forecasts and good earnings, while others express concerns about the limited AI rollout and its implications. After weighing the optimistic sales outlook against the uncertainties, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple.

The analyst maintains a hold rating which signal a neutral prediction. Also, the performance of iPhone depends on when the company rolls out software and hardware, which could be a risk factor. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, there is a general tendency for a moderately positive outlook, but also with considerable deviations. I will reduce my prediction of rising slightly and the prediction is based on all previous predictions to converge the trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is positive but nuanced.  While AI features are boosting iPhone sales in some markets, the limited rollout significantly tempers the positive impact. This creates uncertainty.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, with a slight majority leaning towards a price increase. Models emphasizing the positive sales impact, strong forecasts, and better-than-expected earnings predict a rise.  However, those highlighting uncertainty regarding the limited rollout and the potential mismatch between AI advancements and product upgrades predict a fall or neutrality.  Considering both the news and the prediction history, a moderately positive outlook is justified.  The probability is weighted toward a rise due to the positive sales impact, but a significant fall remains possible due to the limited rollout and inherent market volatility. The predictions trend slightly upwards over rounds, suggesting increasing optimism, but not overwhelmingly so. I'm adjusting slightly upwards to reflect this trend, but remaining cautious given the qualifying statement regarding limited rollout.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast, which has already led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading.
