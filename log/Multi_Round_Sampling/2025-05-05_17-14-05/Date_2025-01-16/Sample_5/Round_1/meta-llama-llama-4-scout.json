(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a focus on investing in metaverse stocks, which indicates a trend towards digital and virtual technologies. While Apple is a major player in consumer electronics and services, its direct involvement and strategic direction concerning the metaverse is less clear. The impact of this news on AAPL could be neutral to slightly positive, as interest in metaverse technologies might increase investment interest in tech companies, including Apple. However, without specific indications of Apple's involvement in metaverse investments, the likelihood of a significant rise or fall in its stock price remains moderate. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability for a rise than a fall, but both remain relatively balanced overall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's investment in \"AI Stocks\". While the headline doesn't explicitly state that Apple is one of them, the context (provided Company: Apple Inc. (AAPL)) implies that Apple is perceived as benefiting from AI or is considered an AI stock in the context of Buffett's investments. Warren Buffett's endorsement and large investment signal significant confidence in the company's future prospects, specifically related to AI. This typically leads to increased investor confidence and buying pressure. The large endorsement could lead to a positive short-term price movement. Because the headline only highlights AI investments and doesn't mention specific negative factors related to Apple, the likelihood of stock falling is relatively lower than stock rising. I am using 0.8 as the probability of the stock rising because generally Buffet's investments are seen in positive light and AI is already a hot topic thus increasing the chances of this news having a positive impact on the stock. Since Buffet's portfolio has stocks other than Apple, there remains uncertainty whether Apple is part of the 24.8%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and past contributions to his campaigns. While this might be seen as typical political engagement by large corporations, the article emphasizes Trump's past contentious relationship with tech leaders, implying that Cook's actions are aimed at mitigating potential future regulatory risks and maintaining a positive relationship for Apple's benefit.  Trump's potential policies could significantly impact Apple (e.g., tariffs, antitrust actions).  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is significantly increased because a positive relationship with the administration could protect Apple from negative regulatory actions, although the impact might be muted given that Apple's stock price is generally influenced by factors broader than the company's relationship with the current administration. The probability assigned reflects a neutral-to-slightly-positive outlook, acknowledging the uncertainty and influence of other market forces. The probability of a fall remains low because a neutral or slightly positive relationship with the administration is likely not a significant negative influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S., which is owned by China's ByteDance. While the ban directly impacts TikTok and its users, the indirect effect on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is minimal. Apple's App Store would no longer distribute TikTok updates or the app itself, but this is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's revenue or stock price, given the company's diverse revenue streams and the relatively small portion of revenue derived from TikTok. Additionally, the ban might lead to increased scrutiny on app store policies, but this is not a new issue for Apple. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, but the impact is likely to be marginal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the overall impact also considers the uncertainties in the tech industry, including the US-China tech conflict and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application. Despite these factors, the positive outlook from TSMC tends to outweigh the negatives for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges facing Apple Inc., including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from local players, and potential disruptions to its credit card business. Additionally, the article mentions that analysts warn of potential iPhone shipment falls and uncertainty due to tariffs. However, Apple still maintains a strong market position and a loyal customer base. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment of the news appears to be negative, which could lead to a decrease in the stock price. Nevertheless, Apple's resilience and adaptability should not be underestimated, and the company may still find ways to mitigate these challenges and maintain its market value.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large companies into Artificial Intelligence (AI). Apple Inc., being one of the largest companies, is likely to be involved in such efforts. This involvement in a rapidly advancing technological sector could enhance investor confidence and potentially increase profitability. However, without specific details on Apple's exact AI-related moves, there's a level of uncertainty whether the market has already priced in these advancements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
