(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a focus on investing in metaverse stocks, which indicates a trend towards digital and virtual technologies. While Apple is a major player in consumer electronics and services, its direct involvement and strategic direction concerning the metaverse is less clear. The impact of this news on AAPL could be neutral to slightly positive, as interest in metaverse technologies might increase investment interest in tech companies, including Apple. However, without specific indications of Apple's involvement in metaverse investments, the likelihood of a significant rise or fall in its stock price remains moderate. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability for a rise than a fall, but both remain relatively balanced overall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's investment in \"AI Stocks\". While the headline doesn't explicitly state that Apple is one of them, the context (provided Company: Apple Inc. (AAPL)) implies that Apple is perceived as benefiting from AI or is considered an AI stock in the context of Buffett's investments. Warren Buffett's endorsement and large investment signal significant confidence in the company's future prospects, specifically related to AI. This typically leads to increased investor confidence and buying pressure. The large endorsement could lead to a positive short-term price movement. Because the headline only highlights AI investments and doesn't mention specific negative factors related to Apple, the likelihood of stock falling is relatively lower than stock rising. I am using 0.8 as the probability of the stock rising because generally Buffet's investments are seen in positive light and AI is already a hot topic thus increasing the chances of this news having a positive impact on the stock. Since Buffet's portfolio has stocks other than Apple, there remains uncertainty whether Apple is part of the 24.8%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and past contributions to his campaigns. While this might be seen as typical political engagement by large corporations, the article emphasizes Trump's past contentious relationship with tech leaders, implying that Cook's actions are aimed at mitigating potential future regulatory risks and maintaining a positive relationship for Apple's benefit.  Trump's potential policies could significantly impact Apple (e.g., tariffs, antitrust actions).  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is significantly increased because a positive relationship with the administration could protect Apple from negative regulatory actions, although the impact might be muted given that Apple's stock price is generally influenced by factors broader than the company's relationship with the current administration. The probability assigned reflects a neutral-to-slightly-positive outlook, acknowledging the uncertainty and influence of other market forces. The probability of a fall remains low because a neutral or slightly positive relationship with the administration is likely not a significant negative influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S., which is owned by China's ByteDance. While the ban directly impacts TikTok and its users, the indirect effect on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is minimal. Apple's App Store would no longer distribute TikTok updates or the app itself, but this is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's revenue or stock price, given the company's diverse revenue streams and the relatively small portion of revenue derived from TikTok. Additionally, the ban might lead to increased scrutiny on app store policies, but this is not a new issue for Apple. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, but the impact is likely to be marginal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the overall impact also considers the uncertainties in the tech industry, including the US-China tech conflict and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application. Despite these factors, the positive outlook from TSMC tends to outweigh the negatives for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges facing Apple Inc., including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from local players, and potential disruptions to its credit card business. Additionally, the article mentions that analysts warn of potential iPhone shipment falls and uncertainty due to tariffs. However, Apple still maintains a strong market position and a loyal customer base. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment of the news appears to be negative, which could lead to a decrease in the stock price. Nevertheless, Apple's resilience and adaptability should not be underestimated, and the company may still find ways to mitigate these challenges and maintain its market value.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large companies into Artificial Intelligence (AI). Apple Inc., being one of the largest companies, is likely to be involved in such efforts. This involvement in a rapidly advancing technological sector could enhance investor confidence and potentially increase profitability. However, without specific details on Apple's exact AI-related moves, there's a level of uncertainty whether the market has already priced in these advancements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While seemingly routine, the article highlights Trump's past conflicts with some of these CEOs.  For Apple, this suggests a proactive effort by Tim Cook to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, potentially mitigating regulatory risks (tariffs, antitrust actions). However, the impact is likely to be subtle.  Apple's stock price is driven by numerous other factors, including product sales, innovation, and overall market sentiment.  The prevalent prior predictions range widely, indicating uncertainty, and the news itself doesn't offer a clear bullish or bearish signal. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory risk, but acknowledge the minimal direct effect of the news on the stock price, alongside the influence of other market factors influencing the probabilities of both a rise and a fall.
