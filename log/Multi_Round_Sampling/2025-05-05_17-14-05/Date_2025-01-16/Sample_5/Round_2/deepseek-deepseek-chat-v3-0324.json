(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't\nNews Content: By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a focus on investing in metaverse stocks, which indicates a trend towards digital and virtual technologies. While Apple is a major player in consumer electronics and services, its direct involvement and strategic direction concerning the metaverse is less clear. The impact of this news on AAPL could be neutral to slightly positive, as interest in metaverse technologies might increase investment interest in tech companies, including Apple. However, without specific indications of Apple's involvement in metaverse investments, the likelihood of a significant rise or fall in its stock price remains moderate. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability for a rise than a fall, but both remain relatively balanced overall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's investment in \"AI Stocks\". While the headline doesn't explicitly state that Apple is one of them, the context (provided Company: Apple Inc. (AAPL)) implies that Apple is perceived as benefiting from AI or is considered an AI stock in the context of Buffett's investments. Warren Buffett's endorsement and large investment signal significant confidence in the company's future prospects, specifically related to AI. This typically leads to increased investor confidence and buying pressure. The large endorsement could lead to a positive short-term price movement. Because the headline only highlights AI investments and doesn't mention specific negative factors related to Apple, the likelihood of stock falling is relatively lower than stock rising. I am using 0.8 as the probability of the stock rising because generally Buffet's investments are seen in positive light and AI is already a hot topic thus increasing the chances of this news having a positive impact on the stock. Since Buffet's portfolio has stocks other than Apple, there remains uncertainty whether Apple is part of the 24.8%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and past contributions to his campaigns. While this might be seen as typical political engagement by large corporations, the article emphasizes Trump's past contentious relationship with tech leaders, implying that Cook's actions are aimed at mitigating potential future regulatory risks and maintaining a positive relationship for Apple's benefit.  Trump's potential policies could significantly impact Apple (e.g., tariffs, antitrust actions).  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is significantly increased because a positive relationship with the administration could protect Apple from negative regulatory actions, although the impact might be muted given that Apple's stock price is generally influenced by factors broader than the company's relationship with the current administration. The probability assigned reflects a neutral-to-slightly-positive outlook, acknowledging the uncertainty and influence of other market forces. The probability of a fall remains low because a neutral or slightly positive relationship with the administration is likely not a significant negative influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S., which is owned by China's ByteDance. While the ban directly impacts TikTok and its users, the indirect effect on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is minimal. Apple's App Store would no longer distribute TikTok updates or the app itself, but this is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's revenue or stock price, given the company's diverse revenue streams and the relatively small portion of revenue derived from TikTok. Additionally, the ban might lead to increased scrutiny on app store policies, but this is not a new issue for Apple. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, but the impact is likely to be marginal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the overall impact also considers the uncertainties in the tech industry, including the US-China tech conflict and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application. Despite these factors, the positive outlook from TSMC tends to outweigh the negatives for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges facing Apple Inc., including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from local players, and potential disruptions to its credit card business. Additionally, the article mentions that analysts warn of potential iPhone shipment falls and uncertainty due to tariffs. However, Apple still maintains a strong market position and a loyal customer base. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment of the news appears to be negative, which could lead to a decrease in the stock price. Nevertheless, Apple's resilience and adaptability should not be underestimated, and the company may still find ways to mitigate these challenges and maintain its market value.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large companies into Artificial Intelligence (AI). Apple Inc., being one of the largest companies, is likely to be involved in such efforts. This involvement in a rapidly advancing technological sector could enhance investor confidence and potentially increase profitability. However, without specific details on Apple's exact AI-related moves, there's a level of uncertainty whether the market has already priced in these advancements.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on investing in metaverse stocks, which implies a broader interest in technological advancements and digital landscapes. Apple, being a major tech player, may attract investor interest as the metaverse concept evolves, even if its direct involvement is not specified. Previous predictions showed a mixed sentiment, with some indicating a higher probability of stock price rise based on broader tech trends. However, the ambiguity regarding Apple's direct participation leads to a moderate outlook. Considering this context, I predict a slightly positive bias towards rising stock prices, reflecting an interest in tech investments, while acknowledging that the absence of specific Apple-related news may temper expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline is very positive for Apple. It suggests a significant investment in AI stocks by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, with Apple potentially being one of the mentioned '2 AI Stocks'. This association with Buffett and AI, which is currently a popular and high-growth area, is generally perceived very positively by the market. The previous round shows varied predictions. Some models have higher confidence in stock price rise (0.8 by gemini-2.0-flash), while others are more cautious. Given the consistency around positive impact of AI and Buffet's investment, coupled with the diverse opinions from the previous round, I will predict a high, but not extreme, probability of price increase. There's always a chance the market has already priced this news in or that Apple isn't one of the two stocks, hence not an extreme value.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on tech CEOs' attendance at and contributions to Trump's inauguration. While seemingly routine, the article highlights Trump's past conflicts with some of these CEOs.  For Apple, this suggests a proactive effort by Tim Cook to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, potentially mitigating regulatory risks (tariffs, antitrust actions). However, the impact is likely to be subtle.  Apple's stock price is driven by numerous other factors, including product sales, innovation, and overall market sentiment.  The prevalent prior predictions range widely, indicating uncertainty, and the news itself doesn't offer a clear bullish or bearish signal. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory risk, but acknowledge the minimal direct effect of the news on the stock price, alongside the influence of other market factors influencing the probabilities of both a rise and a fall. The prior predictions are inconsistent, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the news on Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S., which indirectly affects Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TikTok would no longer be available on the App Store. While this could marginally impact Apple's revenue from app distribution, the overall effect is likely minimal given Apple's diverse revenue streams and the relatively small contribution of TikTok to its total revenue. The ban might also lead to increased scrutiny on app store policies, but this is not a new issue for Apple. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning slightly positive due to broader tech trends and others neutral to slightly negative due to the minimal direct impact. Considering the limited direct effect and Apple's strong market position, the probability of a stock price rise or fall remains balanced but slightly skewed towards a neutral to slightly negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the overall impact also considers the uncertainties in the tech industry, including the US-China tech conflict and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application. Despite these factors, the positive outlook from TSMC tends to outweigh the negatives for Apple in the short term. Additionally, considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general trend indicating a slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents several challenges facing Apple Inc., including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from local players, and potential disruptions to its credit card business. Additionally, the article mentions that analysts warn of potential iPhone shipment falls and uncertainty due to tariffs. However, Apple still maintains a strong market position and a loyal customer base. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment of the news appears to be negative, which could lead to a decrease in the stock price. Nevertheless, Apple's resilience and adaptability should not be underestimated, and the company may still find ways to mitigate these challenges and maintain its market value. The previous predictions from other models show a varied range of opinions, from a high probability of the stock price rising to a high probability of it falling, reflecting the complexity and uncertainty of the situation. Taking into account the negative trends highlighted in the article and the mixed opinions from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large tech companies into Artificial Intelligence (AI), which may imply a broad industry trend toward AI technologies. Given that Apple Inc. is one of the largest companies in the world and has been known to invest in cutting-edge technologies, it is reasonable to infer that Apple could be among those making 'big moves into AI.' This could enhance investor confidence in the company due to perceived growth potentials in a rapidly advancing sector. However, specific details of Apple\u2019s AI strategies are not provided, introducing a level of uncertainty about how much the market has already anticipated these developments. Previous predictions show varying degrees of positive sentiments, possibly reflecting some optimism around AI investments affecting major tech companies positively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
