(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a focus on investing in metaverse stocks, which indicates a trend towards digital and virtual technologies. While Apple is a major player in consumer electronics and services, its direct involvement and strategic direction concerning the metaverse is less clear. The impact of this news on AAPL could be neutral to slightly positive, as interest in metaverse technologies might increase investment interest in tech companies, including Apple. However, without specific indications of Apple's involvement in metaverse investments, the likelihood of a significant rise or fall in its stock price remains moderate. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability for a rise than a fall, but both remain relatively balanced overall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's investment in \"AI Stocks\". While the headline doesn't explicitly state that Apple is one of them, the context (provided Company: Apple Inc. (AAPL)) implies that Apple is perceived as benefiting from AI or is considered an AI stock in the context of Buffett's investments. Warren Buffett's endorsement and large investment signal significant confidence in the company's future prospects, specifically related to AI. This typically leads to increased investor confidence and buying pressure. The large endorsement could lead to a positive short-term price movement. Because the headline only highlights AI investments and doesn't mention specific negative factors related to Apple, the likelihood of stock falling is relatively lower than stock rising. I am using 0.8 as the probability of the stock rising because generally Buffet's investments are seen in positive light and AI is already a hot topic thus increasing the chances of this news having a positive impact on the stock. Since Buffet's portfolio has stocks other than Apple, there remains uncertainty whether Apple is part of the 24.8%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and past contributions to his campaigns. While this might be seen as typical political engagement by large corporations, the article emphasizes Trump's past contentious relationship with tech leaders, implying that Cook's actions are aimed at mitigating potential future regulatory risks and maintaining a positive relationship for Apple's benefit.  Trump's potential policies could significantly impact Apple (e.g., tariffs, antitrust actions).  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is significantly increased because a positive relationship with the administration could protect Apple from negative regulatory actions, although the impact might be muted given that Apple's stock price is generally influenced by factors broader than the company's relationship with the current administration. The probability assigned reflects a neutral-to-slightly-positive outlook, acknowledging the uncertainty and influence of other market forces. The probability of a fall remains low because a neutral or slightly positive relationship with the administration is likely not a significant negative influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S., which is owned by China's ByteDance. While the ban directly impacts TikTok and its users, the indirect effect on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is minimal. Apple's App Store would no longer distribute TikTok updates or the app itself, but this is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's revenue or stock price, given the company's diverse revenue streams and the relatively small portion of revenue derived from TikTok. Additionally, the ban might lead to increased scrutiny on app store policies, but this is not a new issue for Apple. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, but the impact is likely to be marginal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the overall impact also considers the uncertainties in the tech industry, including the US-China tech conflict and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application. Despite these factors, the positive outlook from TSMC tends to outweigh the negatives for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges facing Apple Inc., including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from local players, and potential disruptions to its credit card business. Additionally, the article mentions that analysts warn of potential iPhone shipment falls and uncertainty due to tariffs. However, Apple still maintains a strong market position and a loyal customer base. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment of the news appears to be negative, which could lead to a decrease in the stock price. Nevertheless, Apple's resilience and adaptability should not be underestimated, and the company may still find ways to mitigate these challenges and maintain its market value.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large companies into Artificial Intelligence (AI). Apple Inc., being one of the largest companies, is likely to be involved in such efforts. This involvement in a rapidly advancing technological sector could enhance investor confidence and potentially increase profitability. However, without specific details on Apple's exact AI-related moves, there's a level of uncertainty whether the market has already priced in these advancements.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on investing in metaverse stocks, which implies a broader interest in technological advancements and digital landscapes. Apple, being a major tech player, may attract investor interest as the metaverse concept evolves, even if its direct involvement is not specified. Previous predictions showed a mixed sentiment, with some indicating a higher probability of stock price rise based on broader tech trends. However, the ambiguity regarding Apple's direct participation leads to a moderate outlook. Considering this context, I predict a slightly positive bias towards rising stock prices, reflecting an interest in tech investments, while acknowledging that the absence of specific Apple-related news may temper expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline is very positive for Apple. It suggests a significant investment in AI stocks by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, with Apple potentially being one of the mentioned '2 AI Stocks'. This association with Buffett and AI, which is currently a popular and high-growth area, is generally perceived very positively by the market. The previous round shows varied predictions. Some models have higher confidence in stock price rise (0.8 by gemini-2.0-flash), while others are more cautious. Given the consistency around positive impact of AI and Buffet's investment, coupled with the diverse opinions from the previous round, I will predict a high, but not extreme, probability of price increase. There's always a chance the market has already priced this news in or that Apple isn't one of the two stocks, hence not an extreme value.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on tech CEOs' attendance at and contributions to Trump's inauguration. While seemingly routine, the article highlights Trump's past conflicts with some of these CEOs.  For Apple, this suggests a proactive effort by Tim Cook to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, potentially mitigating regulatory risks (tariffs, antitrust actions). However, the impact is likely to be subtle.  Apple's stock price is driven by numerous other factors, including product sales, innovation, and overall market sentiment.  The prevalent prior predictions range widely, indicating uncertainty, and the news itself doesn't offer a clear bullish or bearish signal. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory risk, but acknowledge the minimal direct effect of the news on the stock price, alongside the influence of other market factors influencing the probabilities of both a rise and a fall. The prior predictions are inconsistent, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the news on Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S., which indirectly affects Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TikTok would no longer be available on the App Store. While this could marginally impact Apple's revenue from app distribution, the overall effect is likely minimal given Apple's diverse revenue streams and the relatively small contribution of TikTok to its total revenue. The ban might also lead to increased scrutiny on app store policies, but this is not a new issue for Apple. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning slightly positive due to broader tech trends and others neutral to slightly negative due to the minimal direct impact. Considering the limited direct effect and Apple's strong market position, the probability of a stock price rise or fall remains balanced but slightly skewed towards a neutral to slightly negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the overall impact also considers the uncertainties in the tech industry, including the US-China tech conflict and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application. Despite these factors, the positive outlook from TSMC tends to outweigh the negatives for Apple in the short term. Additionally, considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general trend indicating a slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents several challenges facing Apple Inc., including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from local players, and potential disruptions to its credit card business. Additionally, the article mentions that analysts warn of potential iPhone shipment falls and uncertainty due to tariffs. However, Apple still maintains a strong market position and a loyal customer base. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment of the news appears to be negative, which could lead to a decrease in the stock price. Nevertheless, Apple's resilience and adaptability should not be underestimated, and the company may still find ways to mitigate these challenges and maintain its market value. The previous predictions from other models show a varied range of opinions, from a high probability of the stock price rising to a high probability of it falling, reflecting the complexity and uncertainty of the situation. Taking into account the negative trends highlighted in the article and the mixed opinions from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large tech companies into Artificial Intelligence (AI), which may imply a broad industry trend toward AI technologies. Given that Apple Inc. is one of the largest companies in the world and has been known to invest in cutting-edge technologies, it is reasonable to infer that Apple could be among those making 'big moves into AI.' This could enhance investor confidence in the company due to perceived growth potentials in a rapidly advancing sector. However, specific details of Apple\u2019s AI strategies are not provided, introducing a level of uncertainty about how much the market has already anticipated these developments. Previous predictions show varying degrees of positive sentiments, possibly reflecting some optimism around AI investments affecting major tech companies positively.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' implies a growing interest in innovative technology sectors, which could positively influence major tech companies like Apple. Despite the lack of direct evidence regarding Apple's specific involvement in the metaverse, it is a prominent player in technology and could benefit from increased investor interest in the sector. Previous predictions showed mixed sentiments; however, a higher number favored a moderate to positive outlook for the stock price due to the overall tech investment trend. Hence, I estimate a probability of 0.65 for the stock price rising and 0.35 for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a strong positive signal for Apple's stock due to Warren Buffett's substantial investment in AI stocks, implying Apple is potentially one of them. However, the lack of explicit confirmation that Apple is one of the selected AI stocks introduces a degree of uncertainty. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some models leaning towards a rise and others being more cautious. Taking into account the positive association with Buffett and AI, but acknowledging the uncertainty and the mixed opinions in previous rounds, I adjust my prediction to be cautiously optimistic. Therefore, the possibility of stock price rising would be higher than stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on tech CEOs' attendance at and contributions to Trump's inauguration. While seemingly routine, the article highlights Trump's past conflicts with some tech leaders, implying a potential for future regulatory impacts.  For Apple, Cook's presence suggests an attempt to mitigate potential negative effects of future Trump administration policies (tariffs, antitrust actions). However, this is a relatively minor factor compared to Apple's overall performance and market trends.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty of the news' direct impact.  The relationship with the Trump administration adds a small positive element, as avoiding negative regulatory actions is beneficial. However, considering the multitude of factors affecting Apple\u2019s stock price, this positive influence is likely to be rather small, and the overall impact of the news on the stock price is likely to be modest. Therefore, a slight increase in the probability of a price rise is deemed appropriate, although the overall probability remains close to neutral, reflecting the dominance of other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S., which indirectly affects Apple Inc.

While this could marginally impact Apple's revenue from app distribution, the overall effect is likely minimal given Apple's diverse revenue streams and the relatively small contribution of TikTok to its total revenue. The ban might also lead to increased scrutiny on app store policies, but this is not a new issue for Apple. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning slightly positive due to broader tech trends and others neutral to slightly negative due to the minimal direct impact. Considering the limited direct effect and Apple's strong market position, the probability of a stock price rise or fall remains balanced but slightly skewed towards a neutral to slightly negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline 'TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending' has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the overall impact also considers the uncertainties in the tech industry, including the US-China tech conflict and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application. Despite these factors, the positive outlook from TSMC tends to outweigh the negatives for Apple in the short term.
