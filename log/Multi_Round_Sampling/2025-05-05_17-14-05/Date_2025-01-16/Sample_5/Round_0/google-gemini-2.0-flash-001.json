While the headline doesn't explicitly state that Apple is one of them, the context (provided Company: Apple Inc. (AAPL)) implies that Apple is perceived as benefiting from AI or is considered an AI stock in the context of Buffett's investments. Warren Buffett's endorsement and large investment signal significant confidence in the company's future prospects, specifically related to AI. This typically leads to increased investor confidence and buying pressure. The large endorsement could lead to a positive short-term price movement. Because the headline only highlights AI investments and doesn't mention specific negative factors related to Apple, the likelihood of stock falling is relatively lower than stock rising. I am using 0.8 as the probability of the stock rising because generally Buffet's investments are seen in positive light and AI is already a hot topic thus increasing the chances of this news having a positive impact on the stock. Since Buffet's portfolio has stocks other than Apple, there remains uncertainty whether Apple is part of the 24.8%.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett's Biggest Artificial Intelligence Bets in 2025: 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 Billion Stock Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.8,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2\n}\n```"
