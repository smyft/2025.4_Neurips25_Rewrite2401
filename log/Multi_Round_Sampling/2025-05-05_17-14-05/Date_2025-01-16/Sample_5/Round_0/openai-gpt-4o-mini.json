While Apple is a major player in consumer electronics and services, its direct involvement and strategic direction concerning the metaverse is less clear. The impact of this news on AAPL could be neutral to slightly positive, as interest in metaverse technologies might increase investment interest in tech companies, including Apple. However, without specific indications of Apple's involvement in metaverse investments, the likelihood of a significant rise or fall in its stock price remains moderate. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability for a rise than a fall, but both remain relatively balanced overall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
