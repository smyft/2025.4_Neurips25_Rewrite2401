(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\nNews Content: Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership could indicate an expansion of Apple's financial services, which is typically viewed positively by investors. Partnerships in the financial sector can enhance customer loyalty and drive more revenue streams for Apple. However, without specifics regarding the partnership details or financial implications, the market reaction may be moderate. Hence, while there is potential for a positive impact, there remains uncertainty that could also lead to a slight decline as some investors may take profits or react to possible competition. Balancing these factors leads to a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the previous year. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Although the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership.  This is potentially positive news as it could expand Apple's services revenue stream and deepen its engagement with its customer base.  However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be modest.  The overall success of the venture remains uncertain. The limited information available prevents a definitive prediction. We are relying on general market reactions to similar partnerships. A successful partnership would likely lead to a small stock price increase. Given the lack of details, the probability of a price change in either direction is relatively small compared to other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' suggests a focus on the metaverse, a growing sector in technology. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has not been a primary player in the metaverse compared to companies like Meta (Facebook). However, Apple's potential involvement or innovation in AR/VR (e.g., Apple Vision Pro) could indirectly benefit from metaverse trends. The news is vague and does not directly mention Apple, so the impact is likely neutral to slightly positive. The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to speculative investor interest in tech trends, but the lack of concrete Apple-specific news limits the upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the potential risks and uncertainties mentioned, such as geopolitical tensions and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application, might temper the stock price rise. Based on the information provided, it seems that the positive impact of TSMC's outlook on Apple's stock price is more significant than the potential negative effects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has fallen to third place in the Chinese smartphone market in 2024, after a year of increasing competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. The article also mentions that Apple is facing uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China and is offering rare discounts to boost sales. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China may outweigh the positive news about the overall market recovery, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests concern or potential issues with Apple Inc., which can lead to negative sentiment among investors. Such headlines often result in decreased stock prices as they indicate uncertainty or potential risks that may affect the company's future performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is exploring a partnership with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card, which could enhance its financial services and generate additional revenue. This expansion may be seen positively by investors, fostering increased customer loyalty. However, the impact on stock price may be moderated by existing market challenges, such as competition and declines in key markets like China. Previous predictions varied, with some indicating positive sentiment due to diversification and others expressing concern over competitive pressures. Balancing these factors suggests a better probability for a stock price increase, but with notable caution due to uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates a significant decline in Apple's performance in the crucial Chinese smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments for 2024 and a substantial 25% drop in Q4. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground rapidly to Huawei and vivo, who are experiencing significant growth. The rise of domestic competitors, coupled with potential government support, creates a challenging environment for Apple to regain its lost market share. Considering the consistent negative implications of the news and weighing that against previous predictions which have demonstrated a leaning towards 'falling' based on negative news about Apple's market share, leads to a higher probability of a price fall than rise. Furthermore, the other predictions in round 0, also tend toward 'fall' when there is negative news about market share, which further weights in favor of a 'falling' prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news snippet is too short to form a definitive opinion.  The headline suggests a potential positive development (a credit card partnership), but the lack of detail prevents a robust assessment.  Previous predictions are highly divergent, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news and the influence of other, undisclosed information impacting the models' estimations.  Some models focused on positive aspects of the potential partnership, while others pointed to negative news from other sources about Apple\u2019s performance in China. This discrepancy highlights the significant weighting of outside factors and showcases information asymmetry. Given the lack of substantive information in the headline, and the conflicting predictions from other models based on potentially different data, a neutral stance is most appropriate. A slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned due to the generally positive perception of expanding into financial services, but this is tempered by the lack of specifics regarding the deal's success and the significant market variations reflected in previous rounds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is vague and does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Apple's potential involvement in AR/VR (e.g., Apple Vision Pro) could indirectly benefit from metaverse trends. Given the lack of concrete Apple-specific news, the impact is likely neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a slight rise due to speculative investor interest in tech trends, while others highlight negative factors like declining market share in China. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the uncertainty remains significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's market share in China, with the company falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. The article also mentions that Apple is facing uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China and is offering rare discounts to boost sales. Considering these factors, the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China may outweigh the positive news about the overall market recovery. However, some predictions from other models suggest a potential for a rise due to speculative investor interest in tech trends or positive impacts from related news. Weighing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'A Perhaps Surprising but Serious Question: Is It Time to Worry About Apple?' suggests a concerning aspect related to the company. Previous predictions show mixed opinions with a majority favoring a higher probability of the stock price falling, particularly due to concerns about market share loss in China and the uncertain impact of the metaverse trend. The overall tone of recent articles leans towards negative sentiment driven by ongoing competition and market dynamics, especially in key markets like China. Despite some neutral to slightly positive news about potential financial partnerships or TSMC's outlook, these factors do not seem strong enough to counterbalance the predominant bearish sentiments. My analysis leans towards considering these mixed signals while factoring in the current market trends and investor perceptions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks for a credit card partnership is perceived as a potential positive development that could enhance its financial services and create new revenue streams. However, this optimism is somewhat tempered by ongoing challenges in key markets, particularly the significant decline in Apple's market share in China, which has led to skepticism among investors about the company's future growth potential. Previous predictions display a range of sentiments, with some indicating a positive outlook due to the partnership and others reflecting concern over competitive pressures and market performance. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability for a slight stock price rise due to the potential benefits of diversifying into financial services, while acknowledging the weight of negative factors that lean toward a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in mainland China, a crucial market. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. Specifically, Apple's shipments dropped 17% in 2024, and 25% year-over-year in Q4 which suggests an acceleration of the decline. This negative performance raises serious concerns among investors about Apple's competitiveness and future revenue streams from the region. The growth of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, who are experiencing growth, suggests a challenging environment for Apple to regain market share, especially with backing from the government. Considering these factors, a stock price decrease seems highly probable. Though previous predictions vary, with some pointing towards minor bullish signals, they are largely based on different news. Factoring in the trend from earlier rounds indicates that negative news more often than not will result in the probability of stock price to fall. Therefore, the negative news from the Chinese market is heavily weighted, giving a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple's potential credit card partnership with Barclays and Synchrony is mildly positive, suggesting expansion into financial services and potential revenue growth. However, the limited information prevents a strong positive prediction.  The conflicting predictions from previous rounds highlight significant uncertainty.  Some models focused on the positive partnership news, while others emphasized negative news regarding Apple's declining market share in China and the overall competitive landscape. The absence of specifics on the partnership's financial implications and the weight of negative China market share data lead to a more conservative assessment.  The overall trend in previous predictions tilts slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, particularly due to persistent concerns about China. Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, acknowledging the contradictory information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is vague and does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Apple's potential involvement in AR/VR (e.g., Apple Vision Pro) could indirectly benefit from metaverse trends. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a slight rise due to speculative investor interest in tech trends, while others highlight negative factors like declining market share in China. The lack of concrete Apple-specific news suggests a neutral to slightly positive impact. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the uncertainty remains significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline 'TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending' suggests a positive outlook for TSMC, which is a major chip supplier for Apple Inc. (AAPL). TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, indicates a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, potential risks and uncertainties such as geopolitical tensions and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application might temper the stock price rise. Considering the positive impact of TSMC's outlook on Apple's stock price and weighing it against previous predictions, which have shown mixed sentiments with a significant number indicating a potential for a rise due to various factors, leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's market share in China, with the company falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. This decline, combined with the intense competition from domestic players and the uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China, may negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising. The previous predictions from other models also show a leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about market share loss in China and uncertain impacts of related trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'A Perhaps Surprising but Serious Question: Is It Time to Worry About Apple?' suggests a concerning aspect related to the company. Previous predictions show mixed opinions with a majority favoring a higher probability of the stock price falling, particularly due to concerns about market share loss in China and the uncertain impact of the metaverse trend. The overall tone of recent articles leans towards negative sentiment driven by ongoing competition and market dynamics, especially in key markets like China. Despite some neutral to slightly positive news about potential financial partnerships or TSMC's outlook, these factors do not seem strong enough to counterbalance the predominant bearish sentiments. My analysis leans towards considering these mixed signals while factoring in the current market trends and investor perceptions.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's discussions for a credit card partnership with Barclays and Synchrony reflects a potential expansion in its financial services, which could be viewed positively by investors. This may improve customer loyalty and create additional revenue streams. However, there are significant concerns surrounding Apple's declining market share in China, where competition from local brands like Huawei and Vivo is intensifying. This geopolitical market dynamic could lead to negative investor sentiment and weigh down stock performance. Balancing these factors, the likelihood for a rising stock price is considered slightly higher than that for a falling price, but investor caution is warranted due to underlying challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The news indicates a notable decline in Apple's market share within the critical Chinese smartphone market. While the overall Chinese market is experiencing recovery, Apple is losing ground to domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo. This is reflected in the 17% decline in shipments for 2024, with an even sharper drop of 25% year-over-year in Q4. Moreover, the trend from prior predictions indicate that almost all models react to negative news by predicting stock price falling. These negative indicators collectively create concern about Apple's competitiveness and future revenue within the region. Factoring the most recent news which is decisively negative and the prior prediciton trend, I predict that the stock prices is more likely to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Apple's potential credit card partnership is mildly positive, suggesting potential revenue growth through expansion into financial services. However, this positive is significantly overshadowed by the consistent reports of Apple's declining market share in China.  The repeated mention of this decline across multiple prediction rounds, along with the lack of specifics regarding the credit card partnership's impact, suggests that the negative news is outweighing any potential benefit from the partnership. The previous predictions show a clear trend toward a higher probability of a stock price fall, heavily influenced by the concerning market share data from China. While some models highlight the potential upside of the credit card partnership and other related positive news, the weight of evidence consistently leans toward a decline due to the significant losses in the Chinese market. This makes it unlikely that a minor positive like a credit card partnership will significantly offset a major negative like substantial market share loss in a crucial region.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is vague and does not directly mention Apple Inc.

Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a slight rise due to speculative investor interest in tech trends, while others highlight negative factors like declining market share in China. The lack of concrete Apple-specific news suggests a neutral to slightly positive impact. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the uncertainty remains significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending' suggests a positive outlook for TSMC, which is a major chip supplier for Apple Inc.
