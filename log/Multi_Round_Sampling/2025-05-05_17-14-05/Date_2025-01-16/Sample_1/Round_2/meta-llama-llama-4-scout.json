(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership could indicate an expansion of Apple's financial services, which is typically viewed positively by investors. Partnerships in the financial sector can enhance customer loyalty and drive more revenue streams for Apple. However, without specifics regarding the partnership details or financial implications, the market reaction may be moderate. Hence, while there is potential for a positive impact, there remains uncertainty that could also lead to a slight decline as some investors may take profits or react to possible competition. Balancing these factors leads to a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the previous year. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Although the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership.  This is potentially positive news as it could expand Apple's services revenue stream and deepen its engagement with its customer base.  However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be modest.  The overall success of the venture remains uncertain. The limited information available prevents a definitive prediction. We are relying on general market reactions to similar partnerships. A successful partnership would likely lead to a small stock price increase. Given the lack of details, the probability of a price change in either direction is relatively small compared to other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' suggests a focus on the metaverse, a growing sector in technology. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has not been a primary player in the metaverse compared to companies like Meta (Facebook). However, Apple's potential involvement or innovation in AR/VR (e.g., Apple Vision Pro) could indirectly benefit from metaverse trends. The news is vague and does not directly mention Apple, so the impact is likely neutral to slightly positive. The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to speculative investor interest in tech trends, but the lack of concrete Apple-specific news limits the upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending has a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is a major chip supplier for Apple. TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a resilient demand for AI hardware. This is likely to have a favorable effect on Apple's stock price, given the close relationship between TSMC and Apple. However, the potential risks and uncertainties mentioned, such as geopolitical tensions and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application, might temper the stock price rise. Based on the information provided, it seems that the positive impact of TSMC's outlook on Apple's stock price is more significant than the potential negative effects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has fallen to third place in the Chinese smartphone market in 2024, after a year of increasing competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. The article also mentions that Apple is facing uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China and is offering rare discounts to boost sales. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China may outweigh the positive news about the overall market recovery, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests concern or potential issues with Apple Inc., which can lead to negative sentiment among investors. Such headlines often result in decreased stock prices as they indicate uncertainty or potential risks that may affect the company's future performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is exploring a partnership with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card, which could enhance its financial services and generate additional revenue. This expansion may be seen positively by investors, fostering increased customer loyalty. However, the impact on stock price may be moderated by existing market challenges, such as competition and declines in key markets like China. Previous predictions varied, with some indicating positive sentiment due to diversification and others expressing concern over competitive pressures. Balancing these factors suggests a better probability for a stock price increase, but with notable caution due to uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates a significant decline in Apple's performance in the crucial Chinese smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments for 2024 and a substantial 25% drop in Q4. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground rapidly to Huawei and vivo, who are experiencing significant growth. The rise of domestic competitors, coupled with potential government support, creates a challenging environment for Apple to regain its lost market share. Considering the consistent negative implications of the news and weighing that against previous predictions which have demonstrated a leaning towards 'falling' based on negative news about Apple's market share, leads to a higher probability of a price fall than rise. Furthermore, the other predictions in round 0, also tend toward 'fall' when there is negative news about market share, which further weights in favor of a 'falling' prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news snippet is too short to form a definitive opinion.  The headline suggests a potential positive development (a credit card partnership), but the lack of detail prevents a robust assessment.  Previous predictions are highly divergent, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news and the influence of other, undisclosed information impacting the models' estimations.  Some models focused on positive aspects of the potential partnership, while others pointed to negative news from other sources about Apple\u2019s performance in China. This discrepancy highlights the significant weighting of outside factors and showcases information asymmetry. Given the lack of substantive information in the headline, and the conflicting predictions from other models based on potentially different data, a neutral stance is most appropriate. A slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned due to the generally positive perception of expanding into financial services, but this is tempered by the lack of specifics regarding the deal's success and the significant market variations reflected in previous rounds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is vague and does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Apple's potential involvement in AR/VR (e.g., Apple Vision Pro) could indirectly benefit from metaverse trends. Given the lack of concrete Apple-specific news, the impact is likely neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a slight rise due to speculative investor interest in tech trends, while others highlight negative factors like declining market share in China. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the uncertainty remains significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's market share in China, with the company falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. The article also mentions that Apple is facing uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China and is offering rare discounts to boost sales. Considering these factors, the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China may outweigh the positive news about the overall market recovery. However, some predictions from other models suggest a potential for a rise due to speculative investor interest in tech trends or positive impacts from related news. Weighing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'A Perhaps Surprising but Serious Question: Is It Time to Worry About Apple?' suggests a concerning aspect related to the company. Previous predictions show mixed opinions with a majority favoring a higher probability of the stock price falling, particularly due to concerns about market share loss in China and the uncertain impact of the metaverse trend. The overall tone of recent articles leans towards negative sentiment driven by ongoing competition and market dynamics, especially in key markets like China. Despite some neutral to slightly positive news about potential financial partnerships or TSMC's outlook, these factors do not seem strong enough to counterbalance the predominant bearish sentiments. My analysis leans towards considering these mixed signals while factoring in the current market trends and investor perceptions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
