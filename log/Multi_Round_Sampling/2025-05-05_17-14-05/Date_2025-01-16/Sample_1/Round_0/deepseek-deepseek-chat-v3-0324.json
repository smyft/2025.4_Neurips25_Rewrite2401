(AAPL) has not been a primary player in the metaverse compared to companies like Meta (Facebook). However, Apple's potential involvement or innovation in AR/VR (e.g., Apple Vision Pro) could indirectly benefit from metaverse trends. The news is vague and does not directly mention Apple, so the impact is likely neutral to slightly positive. The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to speculative investor interest in tech trends, but the lack of concrete Apple-specific news limits the upside.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
