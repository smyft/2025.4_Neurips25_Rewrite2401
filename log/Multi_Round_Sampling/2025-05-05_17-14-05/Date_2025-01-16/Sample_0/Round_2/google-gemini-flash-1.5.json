(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share to local competitors Vivo and Huawei in the Chinese smartphone market. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and expectations regarding Apple's sales and growth in a critical market. Given that Apple has traditionally held a strong position in China, this development is likely to lead to concerns about declining revenue potential, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple losing the top smartphone seller position in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei is a significant negative development. China is a crucial market for Apple, and decreased sales volume there will directly impact revenue and profit margins. The rise of Huawei, in particular, suggests increased competition and potentially a shift in consumer preference towards local brands. This news is highly likely to negatively affect investor sentiment, leading to a sell-off and consequently a decrease in stock price. While Apple is a large, diversified company and this single news event won't be catastrophic, the loss of market share in China raises concerns about future growth prospects. The lack of specific details on the magnitude of market share loss and future strategies from the company tempers the negativity somewhat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and past contributions to his campaigns. While this might be seen as typical political engagement by large corporations, the article emphasizes Trump's past contentious relationship with tech leaders, implying that Cook's actions are aimed at mitigating potential future regulatory risks and maintaining a positive relationship for Apple's benefit.  Trump's potential policies could significantly impact Apple (e.g., tariffs, antitrust actions).  Therefore, the likelihood of a price rise is seen as moderately probable, reflecting a positive interpretation of Cook's actions as proactive risk management, while the likelihood of a price fall is low, as there's no explicit indication of negative news impacting Apple's stock.  However, the uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of Trump's policies introduces some risk, preventing an entirely optimistic prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions 'China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips,' which suggests potential technological advancements and supply chain developments. However, the full content is behind a paywall, limiting detailed analysis. Generally, positive technological breakthroughs and localized chip production could be favorable for Apple, reducing dependency on foreign suppliers and potentially improving margins. However, without full context, the impact remains uncertain. Given the ambiguity, the probabilities are assigned cautiously.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its better-than-expected quarterly results has positively impacted the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a potential increase in demand for Apple's products that rely on TSMC's chips. However, the news does not directly provide financial guidance for Apple. The overall sentiment, though, seems to be positive due to the strong performance of TSMC, which could indirectly benefit Apple by maintaining a robust supply chain for its products. Given this, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling, but the effect might be moderate as the news is not directly related to Apple's financial performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and potentially replacing Goldman Sachs as its credit card partner could be seen as a positive development for Apple, as it suggests the company is exploring new financial partnerships and potentially expanding its services. This could lead to increased revenue streams and improved customer offerings. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the terms of the potential partnership and how the market reacts to the news. Given the information, a moderate positive impact on the stock price is possible, but the probability of a significant rise or fall is difficult to estimate without more details.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a loss in market share for Apple in China, a significant global market, as local brands like Vivo and Huawei have gained the top positions. Losing market share can be interpreted negatively by investors, potentially impacting investor confidence and stock performance adversely. However, it's important to consider other factors such as Apple\u2019s overall global sales, diversification of revenue streams, and potential strategic responses which were not detailed in this brief news.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: Apple's loss of market share in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei represents a significant challenge in a key market, likely leading to negative investor sentiment. The previous predictions reflect a consensus that this development poses a substantial risk to Apple's sales growth potential in China, which could adversely affect revenue and profitability. Despite Apple's strong global brand and diversified revenue streams, concerns about its future growth prospects in a major market like China outweigh potential positive interpretations. Therefore, the probabilities lean heavily towards a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative development for Apple: losing the top smartphone vendor position in China, a crucial market. This loss to local competitors, particularly Huawei, signals increasing competitive pressure and potentially a shift in consumer preference. While other factors like Apple's overall global performance and strategic responses are relevant, the immediate impact of losing market share will likely negatively affect investor sentiment. The previous rounds mostly agree on a negative initial impact. A slight inclination towards price drop since the first round suggests that more may believe that the loss is severe and concerning.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, attending Trump's inauguration and contributing to his campaign.  While this is presented as potentially significant due to Trump's past strained relationship with some tech leaders, the article also highlights that such political donations are common.  The core argument is that tech companies are seeking favorable relations with the administration to influence policies impacting their businesses (regulations, tariffs, antitrust issues). This proactive approach by Cook could be viewed positively by investors as risk mitigation. However, the uncertainty inherent in political relationships and potential policy changes prevents a strong prediction of a stock price increase. The lack of direct, impactful news concerning Apple's financials weakens any case for a significant price movement in either direction.  Considering previous predictions which ranged widely (0.2 to 0.8 probability of a price increase), and the lack of strong evidence for either a price increase or decrease based solely on this news, a neutral stance is adopted.  The previous predictions indicating a significant likelihood of a price drop were based on different news items (e.g. loss of market share in China). This news item is distinct and doesn't offer evidence for a similar conclusion. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips' suggests potential technological advancements and supply chain developments for Apple. However, the full content is behind a paywall, limiting detailed analysis. Previous predictions from other models indicate mixed sentiments, with some focusing on negative aspects like loss of market share in China, while others highlight positive technological and supply chain developments. Given the ambiguity and lack of full context, the probabilities are assigned cautiously. The potential for positive developments in technology and supply chain could offset some negative sentiment, but the overall impact remains uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news provided focuses on TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its better-than-expected quarterly results. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a potential increase in demand for Apple's products that rely on TSMC's chips. This could indirectly benefit Apple by maintaining a robust supply chain for its products. However, the news does not directly provide financial guidance for Apple. Given this, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling, but the effect might be moderate as the news is not directly related to Apple's financial performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is in discussions with Barclays to replace Goldman Sachs as its credit card partner. This development could be seen as positive for Apple, as it suggests the company is exploring new financial partnerships and potentially expanding its services. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the terms of the potential partnership and how the market reacts to the news. Considering the previous predictions, there seems to be a mix of positive and negative interpretations of similar news, but the general trend is cautious optimism when it comes to partnership announcements and potential service expansions. Given this context, a moderate positive impact on the stock price is possible, leading to a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
