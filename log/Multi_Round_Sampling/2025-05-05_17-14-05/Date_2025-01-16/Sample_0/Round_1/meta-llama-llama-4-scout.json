(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs? The Era of Finance CEOs Running Retailers Is Over Why AI Investors Should Worry About the Self-Driving Car Crash\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share to local competitors Vivo and Huawei in the Chinese smartphone market. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and expectations regarding Apple's sales and growth in a critical market. Given that Apple has traditionally held a strong position in China, this development is likely to lead to concerns about declining revenue potential, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple losing the top smartphone seller position in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei is a significant negative development. China is a crucial market for Apple, and decreased sales volume there will directly impact revenue and profit margins. The rise of Huawei, in particular, suggests increased competition and potentially a shift in consumer preference towards local brands. This news is highly likely to negatively affect investor sentiment, leading to a sell-off and consequently a decrease in stock price. While Apple is a large, diversified company and this single news event won't be catastrophic, the loss of market share in China raises concerns about future growth prospects. The lack of specific details on the magnitude of market share loss and future strategies from the company tempers the negativity somewhat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and past contributions to his campaigns. While this might be seen as typical political engagement by large corporations, the article emphasizes Trump's past contentious relationship with tech leaders, implying that Cook's actions are aimed at mitigating potential future regulatory risks and maintaining a positive relationship for Apple's benefit.  Trump's potential policies could significantly impact Apple (e.g., tariffs, antitrust actions).  Therefore, the likelihood of a price rise is seen as moderately probable, reflecting a positive interpretation of Cook's actions as proactive risk management, while the likelihood of a price fall is low, as there's no explicit indication of negative news impacting Apple's stock.  However, the uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of Trump's policies introduces some risk, preventing an entirely optimistic prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions 'China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips,' which suggests potential technological advancements and supply chain developments. However, the full content is behind a paywall, limiting detailed analysis. Generally, positive technological breakthroughs and localized chip production could be favorable for Apple, reducing dependency on foreign suppliers and potentially improving margins. However, without full context, the impact remains uncertain. Given the ambiguity, the probabilities are assigned cautiously.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its better-than-expected quarterly results has positively impacted the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a potential increase in demand for Apple's products that rely on TSMC's chips. However, the news does not directly provide financial guidance for Apple. The overall sentiment, though, seems to be positive due to the strong performance of TSMC, which could indirectly benefit Apple by maintaining a robust supply chain for its products. Given this, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling, but the effect might be moderate as the news is not directly related to Apple's financial performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and potentially replacing Goldman Sachs as its credit card partner could be seen as a positive development for Apple, as it suggests the company is exploring new financial partnerships and potentially expanding its services. This could lead to increased revenue streams and improved customer offerings. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the terms of the potential partnership and how the market reacts to the news. Given the information, a moderate positive impact on the stock price is possible, but the probability of a significant rise or fall is difficult to estimate without more details.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a loss in market share for Apple in China, a significant global market, as local brands like Vivo and Huawei have gained the top positions. Losing market share can be interpreted negatively by investors, potentially impacting investor confidence and stock performance adversely. However, it's important to consider other factors such as Apple\u2019s overall global sales, diversification of revenue streams, and potential strategic responses which were not detailed in this brief news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
