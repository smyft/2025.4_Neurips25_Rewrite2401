(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\nNews Content: Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges facing Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% decline in iPhone sales year over year while competitors like Huawei are gaining market share. This competitive pressure, coupled with Apple's issues finding a new credit card partner, suggests potential instability in customer spending and investor confidence. The broader implications of falling shipment expectations and the impact of possible tariffs add to the uncertainty. While Apple remains a strong company with a robust ecosystem, the negative outlook based on this news indicates a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two potentially conflicting factors. 'China's memory breakthrough' could negatively impact Apple as it might increase competition or reduce component costs, potentially lowering Apple's revenue if not managed correctly. 'Apple's first US chips' on the other hand, is generally positive, indicating a move towards domestic production and potentially reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, improving supply chain resilience and potentially creating US jobs (good PR). Furthermore, lacking specifics about the China breakthrough or the significance of US chips, it is difficult to precisely quantify this news impact on Apple's stock price . Also, the article is locked behind a paywall, making a concrete assessment challenging. Given the limited information and conflicting signals, a conservative approach is best. The headline is very suggestive and requires the full article for complete analysis, due to the uncertainty, I am placing a larger emphasis on a no change or less pronounced movement in the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top spot in the Chinese smartphone market to Vivo and Huawei.  China is a significant market for Apple, and this loss of market share suggests a potential decline in revenue from that region. However, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance might be limited because China, while important, is not its only market. Apple's performance in other regions, its services revenue, and other product lines will also influence its stock price.  The news is negative, but the extent of its impact is uncertain. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than the probability of a rise, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the overall financial health and diversity of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in China, its second-most important market, with a 17% drop in shipments for the year and a 25% drop in the fourth quarter. Despite recapturing the top spot in Q4, competition from Huawei and Vivo is intensifying, exacerbated by US-China tensions and patriotic support for Huawei. Apple's efforts to boost sales through discounts and promotions may mitigate some negative impact, but the overall trend suggests weakening performance in a critical market. This is likely to concern investors about future revenue growth and market positioning.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is losing ground in Mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, experiencing a 17% drop from 2023, and fell to third place in the market. In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 13.1 million devices, a 25% decrease from the same period in 2023. This decline in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor confidence. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news of Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership suggests a potential expansion of Apple's financial services offerings. This could lead to increased revenue streams and diversification of Apple's business, which may be viewed positively by investors. However, without more detailed information about the partnership, it is difficult to estimate the exact impact on the stock price. Generally, news of potential partnerships and expansions can lead to increased investor optimism and potentially drive up the stock price. Given this, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's smartphone shipments in China have declined significantly in 2024, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows increased competition from domestic rivals, particularly Huawei. This could signal challenges for Apple in maintaining market share and potentially impact its financial performance and investor sentiment negatively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
