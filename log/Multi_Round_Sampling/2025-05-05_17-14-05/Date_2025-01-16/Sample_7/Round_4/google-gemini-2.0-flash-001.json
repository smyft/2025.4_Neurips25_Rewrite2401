(AAPL)\nNews Headline: China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips\nNews Content: Hi everyone! This is Lauly from Taipei. I hope 2025 has been kind to you so far.I am writing this week\u2019s newsletter having just finished\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this Financial Times article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription? Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges facing Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% decline in iPhone sales year over year while competitors like Huawei are gaining market share. This competitive pressure, coupled with Apple's issues finding a new credit card partner, suggests potential instability in customer spending and investor confidence. The broader implications of falling shipment expectations and the impact of possible tariffs add to the uncertainty. While Apple remains a strong company with a robust ecosystem, the negative outlook based on this news indicates a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two potentially conflicting factors. 'China's memory breakthrough' could negatively impact Apple as it might increase competition or reduce component costs, potentially lowering Apple's revenue if not managed correctly. 'Apple's first US chips' on the other hand, is generally positive, indicating a move towards domestic production and potentially reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, improving supply chain resilience and potentially creating US jobs (good PR). Furthermore, lacking specifics about the China breakthrough or the significance of US chips, it is difficult to precisely quantify this news impact on Apple's stock price . Also, the article is locked behind a paywall, making a concrete assessment challenging. Given the limited information and conflicting signals, a conservative approach is best. The headline is very suggestive and requires the full article for complete analysis, due to the uncertainty, I am placing a larger emphasis on a no change or less pronounced movement in the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top spot in the Chinese smartphone market to Vivo and Huawei.  China is a significant market for Apple, and this loss of market share suggests a potential decline in revenue from that region. However, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance might be limited because China, while important, is not its only market. Apple's performance in other regions, its services revenue, and other product lines will also influence its stock price.  The news is negative, but the extent of its impact is uncertain. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than the probability of a rise, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the overall financial health and diversity of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in China, its second-most important market, with a 17% drop in shipments for the year and a 25% drop in the fourth quarter. Despite recapturing the top spot in Q4, competition from Huawei and Vivo is intensifying, exacerbated by US-China tensions and patriotic support for Huawei. Apple's efforts to boost sales through discounts and promotions may mitigate some negative impact, but the overall trend suggests weakening performance in a critical market. This is likely to concern investors about future revenue growth and market positioning.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is losing ground in Mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, experiencing a 17% drop from 2023, and fell to third place in the market. In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 13.1 million devices, a 25% decrease from the same period in 2023. This decline in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor confidence. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news of Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership suggests a potential expansion of Apple's financial services offerings. This could lead to increased revenue streams and diversification of Apple's business, which may be viewed positively by investors. However, without more detailed information about the partnership, it is difficult to estimate the exact impact on the stock price. Generally, news of potential partnerships and expansions can lead to increased investor optimism and potentially drive up the stock price. Given this, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's smartphone shipments in China have declined significantly in 2024, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows increased competition from domestic rivals, particularly Huawei. This could signal challenges for Apple in maintaining market share and potentially impact its financial performance and investor sentiment negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a substantial drop in iPhone sales (25% decline year-over-year) and increased competition from local brands like Huawei. Additionally, potential issues with finding a new credit card partner may create further instability. These factors contribute to a negative outlook, especially with forecasts suggesting further declines in shipments and pressures from government tariffs. While Apple is a strong company with a robust ecosystem, the news suggests that its current position is increasingly threatened, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline presents two opposing forces. \"China's memory breakthrough\" could pose a challenge to Apple by potentially increasing competition or reducing component costs, which might, in turn, impact Apple's revenue. Conversely, \"Apple's first US chips\" is generally perceived as positive news. This indicates a move towards domestic production, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers, which improves supply chain resilience and could create US jobs and improve the company image. However, the article is behind a paywall, limiting our ability to completely determine the significance of these developments. Also, the previous round of predictions display an overall bearish sentiment, stemming from the actual news that Apple is losing ground in the Chinese markets, and there are tensions between US and China. I will be placing my prediction in the middle of the road because the news mentions the US chips which should be a positive movement for the stock. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant loss of market share for Apple in the crucial Chinese smartphone market. While Apple remains a globally dominant tech company with diverse revenue streams, this decline is undeniably negative.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a tendency towards a higher probability of a price fall. The lack of access to the full article hinders a precise assessment of the impact. However, the magnitude of the decline in market share in China (loss of the top spot to competitors) suggests a considerable negative impact on revenue and investor sentiment, outweighing potential positive factors not mentioned in the headline.  The consensus leans towards a price drop, and I am factoring in the uncertainty inherent in predicting market reaction to news. Therefore, I am aligning my prediction closer to the more pessimistic estimates, while still acknowledging the potential for resilience from Apple's overall diversified business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% decline in iPhone shipments in Q4 and a 17% drop for the full year, resulting in Apple falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. This decline in a critical market like China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and raise concerns about future revenue growth. While Apple has implemented strategies like discounts and promotions to mitigate the impact, the overall trend of increasing competition and market share loss suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The majority of previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a decline, reinforcing this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments and a 25% decline in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2023. Competitors like Huawei and Vivo are gaining significant market share, posing a challenge to Apple's position in a crucial market. Despite Apple's robust ecosystem and diversified business, the negative trend in China, which is Apple's second-most important market, is likely to concern investors about future revenue growth and market positioning. The overall sentiment from various predictions is that the stock price has a higher probability of falling than rising due to this news. Considering the negative impact on market share and potential revenue, but also accounting for Apple's overall financial health and diversified business, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is in discussions with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, which could lead to an expansion of Apple's financial services offerings and potentially increase revenue streams. This news is generally positive and may be viewed favorably by investors. Considering the trend of others' predictions, it seems that there are mixed views on the impact of Apple's news on its stock price. However, the news of a potential partnership for a credit card is a positive development, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. Given this information, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential benefits of this partnership.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market where the company has experienced a notable decline in smartphone shipments and has lost its leading position to competitors such as Huawei and Vivo. The market share loss in a critical region like China, which accounts for a substantial portion of Apple's profits, could adversely affect investor confidence and the overall company performance. Several previous predictions suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. However, Apple's ability to recapture the top spot in Q4 and its strategic responses such as offering discounts might somewhat mitigate some negative impacts.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% decline in iPhone sales year-over-year and increased competition from local companies like Huawei, which poses a serious threat to Apple's market share and potentially future revenue growth. Additionally, difficulties in securing a new credit card partner add to the instability, raising concerns about consumer spending and overall investor confidence. While Apple's strong ecosystem and diversification may mitigate some negative impacts, the overwhelming signal from this news is bearish, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. Previous predictions reflect similar concerns, consistently showing a trend towards a fall in stock price more than a rise. Therefore, I estimate a high probability that the stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline presents two opposing forces: a potential negative impact from China's memory breakthrough and a potential positive impact from Apple's first US-made chips. The lack of access to the full article makes it difficult to assess the magnitude of each. The previous rounds of predictions show a trend toward a negative outlook, primarily based on the information available about Apple losing market share in China. While the \"US chips\" headline is encouraging, it's not enough to override the prevailing negative sentiment which is caused by the situation from Chinese markets. I am estimating a slight decrease in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant loss of market share for Apple in China, a key market. This is a negative development that could impact revenue and investor sentiment.  While Apple is a diverse company with strong global presence and other revenue streams, the scale of the decline in China (loss of top spot to competitors) is concerning.  The majority of previous predictions also point towards a higher probability of a price drop.  The lack of access to the full article prevents a complete assessment, but the headline alone suggests a negative impact. Considering the negative news, the consensus of previous predictions leaning towards a fall, and Apple's overall strength, I am assigning a higher probability to a price fall. However, Apple's diversification and potential for resilience mitigate the possibility of extreme negative impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% decline in iPhone shipments in Q4 and a 17% drop for the full year, resulting in Apple falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. This decline in a critical market like China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and raise concerns about future revenue growth. While Apple has implemented strategies like discounts and promotions to mitigate the impact, the overall trend of increasing competition and market share loss suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The majority of previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a decline, reinforcing this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc.

Despite Apple's robust ecosystem and diversified business, the negative trend in China, which is Apple's second-most important market, is likely to concern investors about future revenue growth and market positioning. The overall sentiment from various predictions is that the stock price has a higher probability of falling than rising due to this news. Considering the negative impact on market share and potential revenue, but also accounting for Apple's overall financial health and diversified business, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news of Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership is generally positive, as it suggests a potential expansion of Apple's financial services offerings and increased revenue streams. However, considering the trend of others' predictions, which are mostly bearish due to concerns about Apple's market share loss in China and potential negative impacts on revenue and investor sentiment, I must take a more cautious approach. The overall sentiment from various predictions indicates a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, but the positive news about the potential partnership slightly mitigates this negative outlook. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling, but not extremely low due to the potential benefits of the partnership.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, where it has experienced a notable decline in smartphone shipments and has lost its leading position to competitors such as Huawei and Vivo. The market share loss in a critical region like China, which accounts for a substantial portion of Apple's profits, could adversely affect investor confidence and the overall company performance. While Apple remains a financially strong company with a robust ecosystem and diversified business, the negative trends in its second-most important market are likely to concern investors and could negatively impact the stock price. Previous predictions mostly lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling based on similar sentiments.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news presents significant challenges for Apple, notably a 25% decline in iPhone sales in China and increasing competition from local brands like Huawei and Vivo. Apple's market share loss is critical, especially in one of its largest markets. In addition, concerns regarding finding a new credit card partner may further unsettle investor confidence. While Apple retains a strong global presence and diverse revenue streams, the overwhelming negative sentiment from the report, coupled with predictions from other analysts leaning heavily toward a decline in stock price, suggests a higher probability of falling stock prices in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline presents two opposing forces: \"China's memory breakthrough\" (potentially negative for Apple) and \"Apple's first US chips\" (potentially positive). The full news article is inaccessible, hindering a complete assessment. However, the previous rounds of predictions have consistently highlighted Apple's significant challenges in the Chinese market, including substantial declines in iPhone shipments and increased competition from Huawei and Vivo. This negative sentiment overrides the potential positive news about US-made chips. Therefore, I am keeping the prediction close to values by others of previous rounds. This also aligns with the dominant bearish sentiment, I estimate the probability of a stock price fall is higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant loss of market share for Apple in the crucial Chinese smartphone market.  This is a negative development that could impact revenue and investor sentiment. While Apple's diversified business and strong global presence might mitigate some of the negative impact, the loss of the top spot in such a significant market is undeniably concerning.  The consistent trend across multiple prediction rounds indicates a predominantly bearish sentiment, with the majority of models predicting a higher likelihood of a price drop.  The lack of access to the full article limits the comprehensive analysis of the situation. However, the headline alone combined with the overwhelmingly bearish sentiment of previous predictions, suggests a substantial probability of a stock price decline. While Apple's resilience and diversification offer some buffer, the negative impact from the loss of market share in China appears to outweigh other potential positive factors. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% decline in iPhone shipments in Q4 and a 17% drop for the full year, resulting in Apple falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. This decline in a critical market like China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and raise concerns about future revenue growth. While Apple has implemented strategies like discounts and promotions to mitigate the impact, the overall trend of increasing competition and market share loss suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The majority of previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a decline, reinforcing this view. However, Apple's strong ecosystem and diversified business model provide some resilience, which slightly mitigates the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and Vivo. Apple's smartphone shipments in China have declined significantly, with a 17% drop in shipments and a 25% decline in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2023. This decline in a critical market like China, which is Apple's second-most important market, is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and raise concerns about future revenue growth and market positioning. While Apple has a robust ecosystem and diversified business, the negative trend in China suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The consensus from various predictions also leans towards a higher probability of a decline, reinforcing this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is in discussions with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, which could lead to an expansion of Apple's financial services offerings and potentially increase revenue streams. This news is generally positive and may be viewed favorably by investors. However, considering the trend of others' predictions, which are mostly bearish due to concerns about Apple's market share loss in China and potential negative impacts on revenue and investor sentiment, I must take a more cautious approach. The overall sentiment from various predictions indicates a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, but the positive news about the potential partnership slightly mitigates this negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, where it has experienced a notable decline in smartphone shipments and has lost its leading position to competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.
