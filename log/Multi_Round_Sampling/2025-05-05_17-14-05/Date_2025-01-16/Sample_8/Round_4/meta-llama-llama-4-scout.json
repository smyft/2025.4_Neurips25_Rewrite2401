(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 9 of the 10 Largest Companies in the World Are Making Big Moves Into AI. Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention.\nNews Content: It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership could indicate an expansion of Apple's financial services, which is typically viewed positively by investors. Partnerships in the financial sector can enhance customer loyalty and drive more revenue streams for Apple. However, without specifics regarding the partnership details or financial implications, the market reaction may be moderate. Hence, while there is potential for a positive impact, there remains uncertainty that could also lead to a slight decline as some investors may take profits or react to possible competition. Balancing these factors leads to a higher probability of a rise but not an overwhelmingly strong consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the previous year. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Although the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership.  This is potentially positive news as a successful partnership could generate additional revenue streams for Apple through transaction fees and potentially increased Apple Pay adoption. However, the article is behind a paywall, so details regarding the terms of the potential partnership are unavailable for analysis.  The absence of concrete details makes it difficult to definitively assess the impact on the stock price.  Therefore, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the general positive nature of expanding into financial services.  The probabilities are estimations based on general market reaction to similar announcements in the past, and should not be interpreted as financial advice.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. This development is likely to be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights the growing importance of AI in the tech industry and mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the largest companies making significant strides in AI development through its Apple Intelligence initiative. This development, along with the company's inclusion in the list of top companies by market cap that are heavily investing in AI, suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock. The article emphasizes the potential for AI-driven stocks to experience growth, given the expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% in the AI market through 2030. Apple's involvement in AI and its established market presence could lead to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in its stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in the tech industry's approach to the re-election of Donald Trump. Major tech CEOs, including Tim Cook from Apple, are attending the inauguration and donating to Trump's committee. While Trump has had a contentious history with some tech leaders, he is now seen as more pro-business, which could lead to potentially favorable policies for these companies. Although there is historical tension, the current alignment could benefit Apple through reduced tariffs and support on antitrust matters. However, this news is more about the industry's strategic positioning rather than immediate performance indicators.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership suggests a strategic move towards expanding Apple's financial services, which could enhance revenue streams and customer loyalty. This potential partnership is generally viewed positively by investors. However, recent negative market sentiment due to Apple losing market share in China introduces uncertainty. Balancing the positive implications of the credit card partnership with the concerning loss of market share, I estimate a higher probability for stock price rising but also account for the negative sentiment from other factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the same time in 2023. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Though the smartphone market is predicted to grow on an average in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems notably higher. The prior rounds had some contrasting opinions but two models gave pretty high probabilities to stock falling due to the Chinese market news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news is limited and behind a paywall, offering only a hint of a potential credit card partnership. This is generally viewed as positive for Apple, as it expands revenue streams and strengthens its financial services ecosystem. However, the lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the true impact. Previous predictions are highly divergent, reflecting uncertainty and possibly the influence of additional information not contained in this news snippet.  Some models highlight negative information about declining market share in China, which significantly counters the positive potential of the credit card partnership. Given this conflicting information, and the lack of sufficient data from the paywalled article, a neutral stance is warranted. The probabilities below reflect a slight bias toward a neutral position due to the lack of concrete information to support a stronger claim in either direction. The weighting of probabilities reflects the uncertainty and the conflicting information from previous model predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. This development is likely to be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact.

Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline is attributed to the rise of domestic competitors such as Huawei and vivo, which have been supported by government subsidies. The overall smartphone market in China is expected to grow in 2025, but Apple's ability to regain its lost market share is uncertain. Considering this information, as well as the predictions and reasoning provided by other models in previous rounds, it appears that the loss of market share and competition from domestic brands could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on the analysis of the news and the trend of others' beliefs, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in the tech industry's approach to the re-election of Donald Trump. Major tech CEOs, including Tim Cook from Apple, are attending the inauguration and donating to Trump's committee. While Trump has had a contentious history with some tech leaders, he is now seen as more pro-business, which could lead to potentially favorable policies for these companies. Although there is historical tension, the current alignment could benefit Apple through reduced tariffs and support on antitrust matters. However, this news is more about the industry's strategic positioning rather than immediate performance indicators. The mixed signals and historical context make it difficult to assign a high probability of a significant price change.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple entering talks for a credit card partnership with Barclays and Synchrony suggests a potential expansion of its financial services, which is typically a positive development that could enhance revenue streams and customer loyalty. However, the backdrop of Apple's declining market share in Mainland China raises concerns among investors about its competitiveness in a critical market. The previous models exhibited a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty in the market due to conflicting information about both the credit card partnership and the disappointing performance in China. Balancing these aspects leads to a moderate probability for a stock price rise but acknowledges the weight of negative sentiment from market share losses.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, a key market, with a 17% drop in shipments year-over-year for 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4. This decline is attributed to strong competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which are benefiting from government support. While the overall Chinese smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there's no guarantee Apple will regain its lost share. Previous rounds' predictions reflect this negative sentiment, with a general trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Although Apple's product diversification and brand strength could mitigate some of the impact, the news presents a clear negative signal for the company's short-term performance in a crucial market. Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  A potential credit card partnership with Barclays and Synchrony is positive, suggesting revenue diversification and potential growth in Apple's financial services. However, this is offset by significant concerns regarding Apple's declining market share in China, a crucial market.  The paywall prevents a full understanding of the credit card partnership\u2019s details and financial impact.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting overall uncertainty.  While some models lean towards a price increase due to the credit card news, the recurring and impactful news about China's market share loss heavily weighs against this.  The lack of concrete details from the paywalled article makes it difficult to definitively assess the overall impact on stock price. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the negative impact of the China market share loss, while acknowledging the potential upside from the credit card partnership remains unclear and likely less immediate in its effect.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. This development is likely to be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Previous predictions from other models show a trend towards higher probabilities of the stock price falling, especially due to the negative news about market share loss in China. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are making significant moves into AI. Apple is developing 'Apple Intelligence,' which provides high-level consumer AI services through its ecosystem. This development, along with the expected growth in the AI market at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030, suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock. However, previous predictions also indicate concerns over Apple's loss of market share in China, which could negatively impact the stock price. Balancing these factors, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's AI initiatives, but with consideration for the negative sentiment from other factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline is attributed to the rise of domestic competitors such as Huawei and vivo, which have been supported by government subsidies. While the overall smartphone market in China is expected to grow in 2025, Apple's ability to regain its lost market share is uncertain. Considering this information, as well as the trend of others' beliefs, which shows a majority of models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative performance in China, it appears that the loss of market share and competition from domestic brands could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the tech industry's support for President Trump's second term, highlighting contributions from major tech leaders like Tim Cook from Apple. While there might be benefits in terms of reduced tariffs and better policy support, the news does not directly address Apple's near-term financial performance or strategic advancements. Several recent predictions have noted that the loss of market share in China remains a significant concern, outweighing the potential positives. The news also lacks concrete details that could strongly suggest a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Hence, while there's potential for positive sentiment due to anticipated favorable policies, the dominant concern about market share loss balances the probability.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is exploring a credit card partnership with Barclays and Synchrony, which could enhance its financial services and attract more customers, suggesting a positive outlook for the stock price. However, Apple is simultaneously facing significant challenges in Mainland China, where it has lost market share to domestic competitors, leading to a decline in sales. This mixed sentiment creates uncertainty about the overall impact on the stock price. The positive potential of the credit card partnership is somewhat overshadowed by the negative implications of the loss of market share in China, leading to a more balanced outlook on the probabilities of price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's decline in the Mainland China smartphone market is a significant concern, highlighted by a 17% drop in shipments for 2024 and a steeper 25% drop in Q4. This loss of market share to Huawei and vivo, fueled by government support for domestic brands, poses a substantial threat to Apple\u2019s revenue in a critical market. While the overall Chinese smartphone market is projected to grow, there is no certainty that Apple will recover its lost ground. The previous rounds' predictions acknowledge this negative sentiment, showing a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price declining. Considering Apple's diversified product portfolio and brand loyalty, the impact might be somewhat mitigated. However, the news presents a clear negative signal for the company's short-term performance. The consensus from previous predictions leans towards a higher likelihood of a stock price fall. Therefore, I am allocating a higher likelihood of the stock falling\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  A potential credit card partnership with Barclays and Synchrony is positive, suggesting revenue diversification. However, this is significantly overshadowed by the consistent reports of declining market share in China, a crucial market for Apple.  The paywalled nature of the initial article prevents a thorough analysis of the partnership's potential impact. Previous model predictions show considerable divergence, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the situation. While the credit card partnership offers some potential upside, the negative impact of the China market share loss is more prominent and seemingly more immediate.  The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, and I weigh that heavily.  Therefore, I'm assigning higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the negative impact of the China news, acknowledging the potential, but unclear, upside from the credit card partnership.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models show a trend towards higher probabilities of the stock price falling, especially due to the negative news about market share loss in China. While Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact, the immediate reaction is likely to be negative. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline highlights that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are making significant moves into AI. Apple is developing 'Apple Intelligence,' which provides high-level consumer AI services through its ecosystem. This development, along with the expected growth in the AI market at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030, suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock.

Balancing these factors, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's AI initiatives, but with consideration for the negative sentiment from other factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market, with a 17% drop in shipments year-over-year for 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4. This decline is attributed to strong competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which are benefiting from government support. Although Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall sentiment from the provided news and previous predictions leans towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the loss of market share in China. The trend of others' beliefs also shows a majority of models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the tech industry's strategic alignment with President Trump's re-election, emphasizing increased donations and attendance at the inauguration. While this could potentially result in favorable market and policy changes that would benefit Apple, the primary news about China's market share loss is a significant concern. Previous predictions show a strong trend towards Apple's declining market share in China being the predominant factor affecting investor sentiment. Despite the potential positives from better policies and strategic support for the tech industry, the current trends and past negative performances weigh heavily.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
