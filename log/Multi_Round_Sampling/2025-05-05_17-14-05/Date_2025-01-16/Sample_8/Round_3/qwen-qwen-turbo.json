(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership could indicate an expansion of Apple's financial services, which is typically viewed positively by investors. Partnerships in the financial sector can enhance customer loyalty and drive more revenue streams for Apple. However, without specifics regarding the partnership details or financial implications, the market reaction may be moderate. Hence, while there is potential for a positive impact, there remains uncertainty that could also lead to a slight decline as some investors may take profits or react to possible competition. Balancing these factors leads to a higher probability of a rise but not an overwhelmingly strong consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the previous year. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Although the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership.  This is potentially positive news as a successful partnership could generate additional revenue streams for Apple through transaction fees and potentially increased Apple Pay adoption. However, the article is behind a paywall, so details regarding the terms of the potential partnership are unavailable for analysis.  The absence of concrete details makes it difficult to definitively assess the impact on the stock price.  Therefore, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the general positive nature of expanding into financial services.  The probabilities are estimations based on general market reaction to similar announcements in the past, and should not be interpreted as financial advice.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. This development is likely to be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights the growing importance of AI in the tech industry and mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the largest companies making significant strides in AI development through its Apple Intelligence initiative. This development, along with the company's inclusion in the list of top companies by market cap that are heavily investing in AI, suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock. The article emphasizes the potential for AI-driven stocks to experience growth, given the expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% in the AI market through 2030. Apple's involvement in AI and its established market presence could lead to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in its stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in the tech industry's approach to the re-election of Donald Trump. Major tech CEOs, including Tim Cook from Apple, are attending the inauguration and donating to Trump's committee. While Trump has had a contentious history with some tech leaders, he is now seen as more pro-business, which could lead to potentially favorable policies for these companies. Although there is historical tension, the current alignment could benefit Apple through reduced tariffs and support on antitrust matters. However, this news is more about the industry's strategic positioning rather than immediate performance indicators.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership suggests a strategic move towards expanding Apple's financial services, which could enhance revenue streams and customer loyalty. This potential partnership is generally viewed positively by investors. However, recent negative market sentiment due to Apple losing market share in China introduces uncertainty. Balancing the positive implications of the credit card partnership with the concerning loss of market share, I estimate a higher probability for stock price rising but also account for the negative sentiment from other factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the same time in 2023. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Though the smartphone market is predicted to grow on an average in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems notably higher. The prior rounds had some contrasting opinions but two models gave pretty high probabilities to stock falling due to the Chinese market news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news is limited and behind a paywall, offering only a hint of a potential credit card partnership. This is generally viewed as positive for Apple, as it expands revenue streams and strengthens its financial services ecosystem. However, the lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the true impact. Previous predictions are highly divergent, reflecting uncertainty and possibly the influence of additional information not contained in this news snippet.  Some models highlight negative information about declining market share in China, which significantly counters the positive potential of the credit card partnership. Given this conflicting information, and the lack of sufficient data from the paywalled article, a neutral stance is warranted. The probabilities below reflect a slight bias toward a neutral position due to the lack of concrete information to support a stronger claim in either direction. The weighting of probabilities reflects the uncertainty and the conflicting information from previous model predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. This development is likely to be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline is attributed to the rise of domestic competitors such as Huawei and vivo, which have been supported by government subsidies. The overall smartphone market in China is expected to grow in 2025, but Apple's ability to regain its lost market share is uncertain. Considering this information, as well as the predictions and reasoning provided by other models in previous rounds, it appears that the loss of market share and competition from domestic brands could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on the analysis of the news and the trend of others' beliefs, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in the tech industry's approach to the re-election of Donald Trump. Major tech CEOs, including Tim Cook from Apple, are attending the inauguration and donating to Trump's committee. While Trump has had a contentious history with some tech leaders, he is now seen as more pro-business, which could lead to potentially favorable policies for these companies. Although there is historical tension, the current alignment could benefit Apple through reduced tariffs and support on antitrust matters. However, this news is more about the industry's strategic positioning rather than immediate performance indicators. The mixed signals and historical context make it difficult to assign a high probability of a significant price change.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple entering talks for a credit card partnership with Barclays and Synchrony suggests a potential expansion of its financial services, which is typically a positive development that could enhance revenue streams and customer loyalty. However, the backdrop of Apple's declining market share in Mainland China raises concerns among investors about its competitiveness in a critical market. The previous models exhibited a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty in the market due to conflicting information about both the credit card partnership and the disappointing performance in China. Balancing these aspects leads to a moderate probability for a stock price rise but acknowledges the weight of negative sentiment from market share losses.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, a key market, with a 17% drop in shipments year-over-year for 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4. This decline is attributed to strong competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which are benefiting from government support. While the overall Chinese smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there's no guarantee Apple will regain its lost share. Previous rounds' predictions reflect this negative sentiment, with a general trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Although Apple's product diversification and brand strength could mitigate some of the impact, the news presents a clear negative signal for the company's short-term performance in a crucial market. Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  A potential credit card partnership with Barclays and Synchrony is positive, suggesting revenue diversification and potential growth in Apple's financial services. However, this is offset by significant concerns regarding Apple's declining market share in China, a crucial market.  The paywall prevents a full understanding of the credit card partnership\u2019s details and financial impact.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting overall uncertainty.  While some models lean towards a price increase due to the credit card news, the recurring and impactful news about China's market share loss heavily weighs against this.  The lack of concrete details from the paywalled article makes it difficult to definitively assess the overall impact on stock price. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the negative impact of the China market share loss, while acknowledging the potential upside from the credit card partnership remains unclear and likely less immediate in its effect.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. This development is likely to be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Previous predictions from other models show a trend towards higher probabilities of the stock price falling, especially due to the negative news about market share loss in China. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are making significant moves into AI. Apple is developing 'Apple Intelligence,' which provides high-level consumer AI services through its ecosystem. This development, along with the expected growth in the AI market at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030, suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock. However, previous predictions also indicate concerns over Apple's loss of market share in China, which could negatively impact the stock price. Balancing these factors, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's AI initiatives, but with consideration for the negative sentiment from other factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline is attributed to the rise of domestic competitors such as Huawei and vivo, which have been supported by government subsidies. While the overall smartphone market in China is expected to grow in 2025, Apple's ability to regain its lost market share is uncertain. Considering this information, as well as the trend of others' beliefs, which shows a majority of models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative performance in China, it appears that the loss of market share and competition from domestic brands could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the tech industry's support for President Trump's second term, highlighting contributions from major tech leaders like Tim Cook from Apple. While there might be benefits in terms of reduced tariffs and better policy support, the news does not directly address Apple's near-term financial performance or strategic advancements. Several recent predictions have noted that the loss of market share in China remains a significant concern, outweighing the potential positives. The news also lacks concrete details that could strongly suggest a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Hence, while there's potential for positive sentiment due to anticipated favorable policies, the dominant concern about market share loss balances the probability.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
