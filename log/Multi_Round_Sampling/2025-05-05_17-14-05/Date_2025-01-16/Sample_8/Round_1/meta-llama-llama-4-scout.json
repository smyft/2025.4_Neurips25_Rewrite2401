(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 9 of the 10 Largest Companies in the World Are Making Big Moves Into AI. Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention.\nNews Content: It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership could indicate an expansion of Apple's financial services, which is typically viewed positively by investors. Partnerships in the financial sector can enhance customer loyalty and drive more revenue streams for Apple. However, without specifics regarding the partnership details or financial implications, the market reaction may be moderate. Hence, while there is potential for a positive impact, there remains uncertainty that could also lead to a slight decline as some investors may take profits or react to possible competition. Balancing these factors leads to a higher probability of a rise but not an overwhelmingly strong consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the previous year. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Although the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership.  This is potentially positive news as a successful partnership could generate additional revenue streams for Apple through transaction fees and potentially increased Apple Pay adoption. However, the article is behind a paywall, so details regarding the terms of the potential partnership are unavailable for analysis.  The absence of concrete details makes it difficult to definitively assess the impact on the stock price.  Therefore, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the general positive nature of expanding into financial services.  The probabilities are estimations based on general market reaction to similar announcements in the past, and should not be interpreted as financial advice.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact revenue and investor sentiment. This development is likely to be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights the growing importance of AI in the tech industry and mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the largest companies making significant strides in AI development through its Apple Intelligence initiative. This development, along with the company's inclusion in the list of top companies by market cap that are heavily investing in AI, suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock. The article emphasizes the potential for AI-driven stocks to experience growth, given the expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% in the AI market through 2030. Apple's involvement in AI and its established market presence could lead to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in its stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in the tech industry's approach to the re-election of Donald Trump. Major tech CEOs, including Tim Cook from Apple, are attending the inauguration and donating to Trump's committee. While Trump has had a contentious history with some tech leaders, he is now seen as more pro-business, which could lead to potentially favorable policies for these companies. Although there is historical tension, the current alignment could benefit Apple through reduced tariffs and support on antitrust matters. However, this news is more about the industry's strategic positioning rather than immediate performance indicators.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
