(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024\nNews Content: Mainland China's smartphone market shipped 285 million units in 2024, achieving 4% annual growth following two years of decline, Canalys reported Thursday. Rising demand across all sectors drove the recovery; suppliers used smart investments and technology improvements.\n\nComprising 17% of all shipments, vivo dominated the market with 49.3 million devices delivered. With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025. To attract customers across price points, vendors are anticipated to concentrate on increased product features including better battery life, creative form factors, and AI-powered systems.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the previous year. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Although the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising in the short term.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
