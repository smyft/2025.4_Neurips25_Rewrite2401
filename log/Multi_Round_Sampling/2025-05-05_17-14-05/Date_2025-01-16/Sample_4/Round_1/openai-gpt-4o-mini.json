(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 9 of the 10 Largest Companies in the World Are Making Big Moves Into AI. Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention.\nNews Content: It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that the majority of the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments and advancements in AI. This indicates a strong market trend towards AI, which is likely to enhance investor confidence and interest in AI-related stocks. Given Apple's established position in the market and its commitment to AI development, it is probable that this positive news will lead to a rise in its stock price. However, there could also be some investor caution due to potential market volatility or profit-taking strategies, hence a smaller probability of price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on the broader trend of large companies investing in AI. While Apple is implicitly included as one of the '10 largest companies', the news doesn't detail Apple's specific AI initiatives or investments. The lack of specific positive information about Apple's AI strategy makes a strong positive price surge less likely. However, the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI investment by major companies provides slight upward pressure to all stocks fitting this criteria. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than that of a fall in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights that nine of the top ten global companies are investing heavily in AI. While this is generally positive for the tech sector and might boost investor sentiment, the impact on Apple specifically is indirect.  The news doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's AI initiatives beyond the implication of their participation in this broader trend, therefore, a significant price movement solely based on this news is unlikely.   The headline creates a generally positive market sentiment around AI, but it lacks specifics about Apple. Therefore, a relatively neutral probabilistic outcome is predicted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a significant market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact its revenue and growth prospects. This development is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is losing ground in mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, representing a 17% drop from 2023, placing it third in the market. In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 13.1 million devices, a 25% decrease from the same period in 2023. This decline in market share and sales in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's stock price. The overall positive market growth and expectations for 2025 may mitigate some of the negative impact but do not outweigh the immediate concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has fallen to third place in the Chinese smartphone market in 2024, after a year of increasing competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. The article also mentions that Apple is facing uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China and is offering rare discounts to boost sales. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China may outweigh the positive news about the overall market recovery, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large companies into Artificial Intelligence (AI). Apple Inc., being one of the largest companies, is likely to be involved in such efforts. This involvement in a rapidly advancing technological sector could enhance investor confidence and potentially increase profitability. However, without specific details on Apple's exact AI-related moves, there's a level of uncertainty whether the market has already priced in these advancements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
