A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that the majority of the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments and advancements in AI. This indicates a strong market trend towards AI, which is likely to enhance investor confidence and interest in AI-related stocks. Given Apple's established position in the market and its commitment to AI development, it is probable that this positive news will lead to a rise in its stock price. However, there could also be some investor caution due to potential market volatility or profit-taking strategies, hence a smaller probability of price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on the broader trend of large companies investing in AI. While Apple is implicitly included as one of the '10 largest companies', the news doesn't detail Apple's specific AI initiatives or investments. The lack of specific positive information about Apple's AI strategy makes a strong positive price surge less likely. However, the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI investment by major companies provides slight upward pressure to all stocks fitting this criteria. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than that of a fall in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights that nine of the top ten global companies are investing heavily in AI. While this is generally positive for the tech sector and might boost investor sentiment, the impact on Apple specifically is indirect.  The news doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's AI initiatives beyond the implication of their participation in this broader trend, therefore, a significant price movement solely based on this news is unlikely.   The headline creates a generally positive market sentiment around AI, but it lacks specifics about Apple. Therefore, a relatively neutral probabilistic outcome is predicted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a significant market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact its revenue and growth prospects. This development is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is losing ground in mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, representing a 17% drop from 2023, placing it third in the market. In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 13.1 million devices, a 25% decrease from the same period in 2023. This decline in market share and sales in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's stock price. The overall positive market growth and expectations for 2025 may mitigate some of the negative impact but do not outweigh the immediate concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has fallen to third place in the Chinese smartphone market in 2024, after a year of increasing competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. The article also mentions that Apple is facing uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China and is offering rare discounts to boost sales. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China may outweigh the positive news about the overall market recovery, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large companies into Artificial Intelligence (AI). Apple Inc., being one of the largest companies, is likely to be involved in such efforts. This involvement in a rapidly advancing technological sector could enhance investor confidence and potentially increase profitability. However, without specific details on Apple's exact AI-related moves, there's a level of uncertainty whether the market has already priced in these advancements.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant focus of major companies, including Apple, on artificial intelligence (AI), which is currently driving market growth. This trend suggests a positive outlook for companies investing in AI, like Apple, which is implementing AI through its Apple Intelligence initiative. The mention of AI's potential and Apple's established market presence bolsters investor confidence. However, previous market volatility and some caution due to uncertainties in specific AI advancements may temper the probability of a dramatic price increase. Balancing these factors leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising, albeit with a moderated expectation due to inherent market risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The initial round of predictions shows a wide divergence in viewpoints, primarily driven by two conflicting narratives: the positive AI trend and Apple's declining market share in China. The AI narrative, while generally positive, lacks specific details about Apple's involvement, leading to some restrained optimism. Conversely, the news about Apple's struggles in China, especially losing market share, triggered more bearish predictions. There seems to be a tug-of-war between these two narratives. Given that the news specifically provided is about AI investment to drive growth with the top companies getting involved, I predict higher confidence in the stock price going up. Investors are likely to be more excited about growth potential than concerned about current challenges in China. I will however, be more conservative in my price increase prediction due to the negative sentiment expressed towards concerns in China.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on the broader trend of large companies investing in AI, mentioning Apple's implicit inclusion among the top 10.  However, the lack of specific details on Apple's AI initiatives makes it difficult to directly link the news to a significant price movement.  Several previous predictions highlight conflicting information: some models emphasize potential positive effects from general AI investment, while others point to negative news concerning Apple's declining market share in China.  The conflicting information and lack of specific Apple-related AI news significantly weaken any strong prediction for a price rise or fall.  Considering the overall sentiment, a slightly higher probability of a rise is assigned, reflecting the general positive AI narrative but tempered by the uncertainties regarding Apple's specific situation and the mixed signals from the previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a significant market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact its revenue and growth prospects. This development is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. While Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact, the immediate concerns about declining market share and sales in China are likely to dominate investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also largely support a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models predicting a 70% chance of a decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost ground in mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, representing a 17% drop from 2023, placing it third in the market. In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 13.1 million devices, a 25% decrease from the same period in 2023. This decline in market share and sales in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Although the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter, and expectations for 2025 are positive, the immediate concerns about Apple's performance in China may outweigh the positive news. Considering the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei, with a significant decline in shipments. However, the company recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter. Considering the overall market recovery and Apple's efforts to boost sales, such as offering rare discounts, the negative news about declining market share and shipments may have a significant impact on the stock price. Nevertheless, Apple's diversified product portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and potential advancements in AI could mitigate some of the negative effects. Analyzing the predictions from previous rounds, there is a mix of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the decline in market share and shipments, while others predict a rise due to the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's potential involvement in AI advancements. Given the balanced views and considering the provided news, a neutral to slightly negative outlook seems plausible.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news emphasizes the significant momentum in AI investments among the world's largest companies, including Apple. As a member of the top tier of companies driving this technological shift, investor sentiment towards Apple seems poised to gain traction from the overall excitement surrounding AI developments. However, there is counteracting sentiment due to Apple's declining market share in China, which has led to mixed predictions in previous analyses. Balancing these factors, while the trend towards AI investment suggests a positive outlook, the negative implications from market share losses create a cautious environment. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rise based on overall market confidence in AI, but still acknowledge risks that may limit gains.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The continued focus on AI investment by major companies, including Apple, suggests a positive long-term outlook. However, the strong and consistent negative sentiment stemming from Apple's struggles in the Chinese market cannot be ignored. The previous round revealed a clear tug-of-war between the positive AI trend and the negative China news. While the China concerns might be somewhat priced in at this point, new information hasn't emerged to alleviate those fears. Therefore, the AI narrative, while still important, is tempered by the realistic implications of the China market challenges. This round, I shift my prediction slightly to reflect this persistent negative undercurrent. The lack of any news alleviating China concerns requires a recalibration towards a cautiously pessimistic viewpoint.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on the broader AI investment trend among large companies, including Apple.  While this is generally positive, it lacks specific details about Apple's AI initiatives, making direct impact assessment difficult.  The conflicting information from previous predictions highlights this ambiguity. Some models emphasize the positive AI narrative and Apple's inherent strength, while several others strongly point towards the negative impact of Apple's declining market share in China.  The decreased market share in China is a significant factor, outweighing the less concrete positive AI trend in this case. The inconsistent predictions across models in the previous rounds reflect this uncertainty and the lack of specific, Apple-centric news.  Therefore, a neutral probability is not justifiable, as the negative news (China market share decline) seems more concrete and impactful in the short term than the general positive AI trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei, with a significant decline in shipments. China is a crucial market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact its revenue and growth prospects. This development is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. While Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact, the immediate concerns about declining market share and sales in China are likely to dominate investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also largely support a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models predicting a 70% chance of a decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost ground in mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo.

Previous predictions from other models also largely support a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about declining market share and shipments in China. Considering these factors, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei.

However, the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter, and Apple's efforts to boost sales, such as offering rare discounts, might mitigate some of the negative effects.
