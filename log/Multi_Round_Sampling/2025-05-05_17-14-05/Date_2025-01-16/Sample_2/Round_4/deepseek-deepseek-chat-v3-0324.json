(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\nNews Content: Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The announcement of China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips suggests significant advancements in technology for Apple. This could enhance their supply chain efficiency and potentially increase profit margins. On the other hand, if the memory breakthrough offers competitive advantages for other companies, it could pose risks to Apple's market share. Given the positive aspect of innovation and manufacturing domestic chips, the overall sentiment is likely to lean towards a price increase. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's AI investments within Berkshire Hathaway, specifically mentioning two unnamed AI stocks that comprise 24.8% of the portfolio.  This news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Buffett's investment choices in other companies do not directly influence Apple's performance or valuation.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal.  Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors or news specific to Apple, not this particular headline. We assume a neutral market bias.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in China, a critical market, with a 25% drop in shipments in Q4 2024 and a 17% decline for the full year. This is attributed to intense competition from domestic players like Huawei, which saw significant growth. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4, the overall trend suggests weakening demand for iPhones in China due to patriotic consumer sentiment and competitive pressures. The company's rare discounts and promotional efforts indicate challenges in maintaining sales. Given these factors, the news is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's biggest artificial intelligence bets in 2025, with 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 billion stock portfolio invested in two AI stocks. However, the headline does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the AI stocks. Given that Apple has been making significant strides in AI technology, especially with its recent advancements in machine learning and AI-driven features in its products, there might be a neutral to slightly positive sentiment if investors perceive Apple as a key player in the AI space. However, without direct mention, the impact might be limited. The probability of the stock price rising or falling is more dependent on the direct association of Apple with AI stocks mentioned in the portfolio.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local makers Vivo and Huawei. This loss of market share in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability, potentially leading to a decrease in its stock price. However, it's also important to consider that Apple's overall global market position, brand loyalty, and diverse product lines might mitigate the impact of this specific market loss. Given the nature of the news, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' does not provide concrete information specific to Apple Inc., making it difficult to determine the direct impact on AAPL's stock price. The Metaverse is an emerging technology area, and while Apple has not made explicit public statements or announcements regarding its involvement, investors might speculate various outcomes based on broader industry trends and Apple's existing technological capabilities. However, without more specific details linking Apple directly to Metaverse investments or initiatives, the influence on the stock price remains uncertain.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The announcement of China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first U.S. chips signifies major advancements in technology for Apple, potentially enhancing their supply chain efficiency and profitability. While there are risks associated with competition from domestic companies in China, the overall sentiment seems positive towards Apple as it aims to mitigate supply chain challenges. Given this context, I predict a higher likelihood of a stock price rise as investors may view these developments as a step forward in maintaining competitiveness and profitability, despite the concerns regarding market share in China.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is relatively generic. While Apple has not explicitly stated a major Metaverse strategy, they are heavily invested in AR/VR technologies which could be seen as a stepping stone to the Metaverse. Also, the previous round models exhibit different points of view, and the average prediction of rising is 0.43, while that of falling is 0.54. Taking everything into account, the increase probability is less than 0.5.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's AI investments, which are unrelated to Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some citing positive factors like domestic chip production and innovation (leading to a predicted rise), while others highlight negative factors such as declining market share in China (leading to a predicted fall).  The lack of direct connection between Apple and Buffett's AI investments makes it unlikely the news will significantly affect Apple's stock price in either direction. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is slightly leaning towards a price rise despite conflicting external information, however, the lack of direct association is a crucial point. Therefore, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome, with a near equal probability of rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in China, a critical market, with a 25% drop in shipments in Q4 2024 and a 17% decline for the full year. This is attributed to intense competition from domestic players like Huawei, which saw significant growth. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4, the overall trend suggests weakening demand for iPhones in China due to patriotic consumer sentiment and competitive pressures. The company's rare discounts and promotional efforts indicate challenges in maintaining sales. Given these factors, the news is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and global market position might mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's AI investments within Berkshire Hathaway, specifically mentioning two unnamed AI stocks that comprise 24.8% of the portfolio. This news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the AI stocks. Given that Apple has been making significant strides in AI technology, there might be a neutral to slightly positive sentiment if investors perceive Apple as a key player in the AI space. However, without direct mention, the impact might be limited. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, considering Apple's general positive outlook in AI advancements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local makers Vivo and Huawei. This loss of market share in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability, potentially leading to a decrease in its stock price. Considering the previous predictions, most models agree that the news has a negative impact on Apple's stock price, with some models indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the trend of others' beliefs and the negative news, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' does not provide concrete information specific to Apple Inc., making it difficult to determine the direct impact on AAPL's stock price. The Metaverse is an emerging technology area, and while Apple has not made explicit public statements or announcements regarding its involvement, investors might speculate various outcomes based on broader industry trends and Apple's existing technological capabilities. However, without more specific details linking Apple directly to Metaverse investments or initiatives, the influence on the stock price remains uncertain. The previous predictions show mixed opinions with a slight negative bias due to various reasons including market share loss in China and general investor sentiments. Considering the lack of direct information and the mix of predictions, there's a neutral to slightly negative sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple's first U.S. chips presents a mix of positive and negative factors for Apple Inc. While advancements in domestic chip production and memory technology can signify increased efficiency and potentially bolster profit margins, concerns about declining market share in China due to competitive pressures from local brands like Huawei could negatively impact investor sentiment. Analyzing previous predictions, there appears to be a slightly positive sentiment leaning towards the news related to technological advancements, but the persistent challenges in the Chinese market suggest a higher probability of stock price decline. Overall, the mixed outlook leads me to predict a slightly higher probability of falling prices. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.45 for a price rise and 0.55 for a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is quite broad. Apple's involvement in the metaverse is not clearly defined, although they have significant AR/VR capabilities that could be seen as related. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly negative. This suggests uncertainty in the market's perception of Apple and the metaverse. Given this uncertainty, I will assign a slightly lower probability to the stock price rising and a slightly higher probability to it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's AI investments, which are irrelevant to Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting conflicting information. Some models highlight positive factors like Apple's domestic chip production and innovation, while others emphasize negative factors such as declining market share in China. The absence of a direct link between Apple and Buffett's AI investments suggests a minimal impact on Apple's stock price.  The consensus from previous rounds shows a slight negative bias, primarily driven by concerns about Apple's weakening position in the Chinese market. However, the overall uncertainty and lack of direct relevance to Apple outweighs the negative sentiment. Therefore, I predict a near-neutral probability, slightly leaning toward a price decrease given the prevailing concerns from previous rounds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in China, a critical market, with a 25% drop in shipments in Q4 2024 and a 17% decline for the full year.

Previous predictions show mixed opinions, with some citing positive factors like domestic chip production and innovation, while others highlight negative factors such as declining market share in China. Given the lack of direct connection between Apple and Buffett's AI investments, the impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. However, considering the overall sentiment from previous predictions, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's general positive outlook in AI advancements and its efforts in domestic chip production.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

On one hand, advancements in domestic chip production can enhance supply chain efficiency and may improve Apple's profit margins in the long run. On the other hand, Apple's reported decline in market share in China amidst intense competition introduces significant concerns about future revenue from a critical market. The consensus among previous predictions leans slightly towards a negative sentiment due to ongoing competitive pressures, leading to an estimated higher probability of a stock price decline compared to a rise. Overall, while some advancements are promising, the prevailing issues in the Chinese market appear to outweigh the positive news, suggesting a cautious outlook from investors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is quite general and doesn't provide specific details about Apple's involvement or investments in the metaverse. While Apple has AR/VR technology, its strategy for the metaverse is not clearly defined. The previous rounds of predictions show a slightly negative trend. The main concern impacting Apple's stock stems from declining market share in China and other global competitive pressures. Therefore, there will be near neutral impact in the rise of the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline is largely irrelevant to Apple. It focuses on Warren Buffett's AI investments in other companies. While Apple is involved in AI, there's no direct link to the mentioned investments.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting conflicting information. Some models highlight positive factors like domestic chip production and innovation, while others emphasize negative factors such as declining market share in China.  The most significant factor seems to be the loss of market share in China.  However, this information was present in earlier rounds and as there are only indirect connections between the news and Apple's stock price, I will weight the relevance of the news significantly less than the information provided about China. The average probability of a stock price rise across all previous rounds is around 0.46, while that of a price fall is around 0.54. Therefore, considering the lack of direct relevance and the slightly negative overall trend from previous rounds, I predict a slightly higher probability for a fall. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in China, a critical market, with a 25% drop in shipments in Q4 2024 and a 17% decline for the full year.
