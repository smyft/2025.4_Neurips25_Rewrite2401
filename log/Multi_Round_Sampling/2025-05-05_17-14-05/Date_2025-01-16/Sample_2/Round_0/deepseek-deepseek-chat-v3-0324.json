(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\nNews Content: Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

This is attributed to intense competition from domestic players like Huawei, which saw significant growth. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4, the overall trend suggests weakening demand for iPhones in China due to patriotic consumer sentiment and competitive pressures. The company's rare discounts and promotional efforts indicate challenges in maintaining sales. Given these factors, the news is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
