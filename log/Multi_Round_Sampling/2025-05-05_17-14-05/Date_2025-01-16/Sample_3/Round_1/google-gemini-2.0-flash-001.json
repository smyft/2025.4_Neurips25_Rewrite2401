(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The ban on TikTok could lead to increased sales for Apple as users may need to purchase new devices or adjust their settings to access alternative apps. However, it also poses risks, as Apple's App Store will be directly impacted by the removal of TikTok, potentially leading to decreased user engagement and revenue from app downloads. Overall, the potential for increased device sales might outweigh the risks in the short term, supporting a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a potentially positive, or at least neutral, outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to its CEO's willingness to engage with a potentially pro-business Trump administration. Tim Cook's established relationship with Trump, potential influence on tariff policies (beneficial for Apple's manufacturing), and antitrust issues could all be positively addressed with an open channel to the White House. While political donations are normal, Trump's emphasis on loyalty suggests that proactive engagement could benefit companies. This suggests reduced risk and opportunity for influence with policy and regulation, leading to an estimated slightly higher probability of a stock rise than fall. However, the article also highlights potential downsides. Aligning with a controversial political figure can alienate parts of Apple's customer base, creating short-term volatility. The overall market sentiment and other company-specific news will play major roles, which are impossible to predict from this headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights that nine of the top ten global companies are investing heavily in AI. While this is generally positive for the tech sector and might boost investor sentiment, the impact on Apple specifically is indirect.  The news doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's AI initiatives beyond the implication of their presence among the top ten players. Therefore, any price movement is likely to be subdued and driven more by general market trends related to AI rather than company-specific news.  We should expect some positive sentiment leading to a slight increase in probability of price rise, but this will be modest due to lack of specific news about Apple's AI plans.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost significant ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% decline in Q4 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which have shown substantial growth. Given that China is a critical market for Apple, this loss of market share is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and could lead to downward pressure on the stock price. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's underperformance relative to competitors suggests potential challenges in maintaining its premium positioning and growth trajectory in the region.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs. This development could be viewed as a positive move by investors, as it may indicate a strengthening of Apple's financial services offerings and a potential reduction in dependence on Goldman Sachs. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the terms of the partnership and the market's perception of the news. Given the neutral to positive tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the market and how the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in AI. This trend is expected to drive growth in the market, with the AI market projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030. As Apple is one of the companies making big moves into AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. The article also mentions that the top 10 companies, including Apple, have a combined market cap of over $19 trillion, which is significantly larger than the next tier of companies, indicating a strong market presence and potential for growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large tech companies in AI technologies, positioning Apple as one of them. Given Apple's track record and the trend towards AI-driven innovations, it is likely that such investments will positively influence investor sentiment and potentially boost the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
