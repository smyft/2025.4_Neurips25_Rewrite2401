(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024\nNews Content: Mainland China's smartphone market shipped 285 million units in 2024, achieving 4% annual growth following two years of decline, Canalys reported Thursday. Rising demand across all sectors drove the recovery; suppliers used smart investments and technology improvements.\n\nComprising 17% of all shipments, vivo dominated the market with 49.3 million devices delivered. With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025. To attract customers across price points, vendors are anticipated to concentrate on increased product features including better battery life, creative form factors, and AI-powered systems.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The ban on TikTok could lead to increased sales for Apple as users may need to purchase new devices or adjust their settings to access alternative apps. However, it also poses risks, as Apple's App Store will be directly impacted by the removal of TikTok, potentially leading to decreased user engagement and revenue from app downloads. Overall, the potential for increased device sales might outweigh the risks in the short term, supporting a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a potentially positive, or at least neutral, outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to its CEO's willingness to engage with a potentially pro-business Trump administration. Tim Cook's established relationship with Trump, potential influence on tariff policies (beneficial for Apple's manufacturing), and antitrust issues could all be positively addressed with an open channel to the White House. While political donations are normal, Trump's emphasis on loyalty suggests that proactive engagement could benefit companies. This suggests reduced risk and opportunity for influence with policy and regulation, leading to an estimated slightly higher probability of a stock rise than fall. However, the article also highlights potential downsides. Aligning with a controversial political figure can alienate parts of Apple's customer base, creating short-term volatility. The overall market sentiment and other company-specific news will play major roles, which are impossible to predict from this headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights that nine of the top ten global companies are investing heavily in AI. While this is generally positive for the tech sector and might boost investor sentiment, the impact on Apple specifically is indirect.  The news doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's AI initiatives beyond the implication of their presence among the top ten players. Therefore, any price movement is likely to be subdued and driven more by general market trends related to AI rather than company-specific news.  We should expect some positive sentiment leading to a slight increase in probability of price rise, but this will be modest due to lack of specific news about Apple's AI plans.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost significant ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% decline in Q4 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which have shown substantial growth. Given that China is a critical market for Apple, this loss of market share is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and could lead to downward pressure on the stock price. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's underperformance relative to competitors suggests potential challenges in maintaining its premium positioning and growth trajectory in the region.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs. This development could be viewed as a positive move by investors, as it may indicate a strengthening of Apple's financial services offerings and a potential reduction in dependence on Goldman Sachs. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the terms of the partnership and the market's perception of the news. Given the neutral to positive tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the market and how the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in AI. This trend is expected to drive growth in the market, with the AI market projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030. As Apple is one of the companies making big moves into AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. The article also mentions that the top 10 companies, including Apple, have a combined market cap of over $19 trillion, which is significantly larger than the next tier of companies, indicating a strong market presence and potential for growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large tech companies in AI technologies, positioning Apple as one of them. Given Apple's track record and the trend towards AI-driven innovations, it is likely that such investments will positively influence investor sentiment and potentially boost the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban in the U.S. could present a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the removal of TikTok, a major competitor in the social media space, could drive users towards Apple's ecosystem, potentially increasing sales of Apple devices as users look for alternatives. However, there are significant risks involved; the removal of TikTok would directly affect Apple's App Store revenues due to decreased engagement and downloads, which is critical for its services segment. Comparatively, previous predictions lean toward a slight positive sentiment owing to Apple's broader market position. Therefore, while there is some potential for an uptick in stock price due to increased device sales, the risks associated with app engagement and revenue streams suggest a balance of probabilities slightly favoring a decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) as its CEO, Tim Cook, is attending Trump's inauguration and has historically maintained a good relationship with him. This suggests that Apple could have a favorable position in discussions regarding tariffs and antitrust issues under the new administration. While the news also mentions that other tech executives are cozying up to Trump for various reasons, Tim Cook's established relationship with Trump indicates that there are minimal unknowns and Apple has a chance of leveraging this to bring pro-Apple policies influencing a stock rise. The other models had varying predictions, most indicating a higher chance of stock price rise with some indicating a stock price fall. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline is broadly positive for the tech sector, highlighting increased AI investment by major players including Apple. However, the news lacks specifics about Apple's AI strategy or its immediate impact on the company's financials.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a significant rise (0.8 probability) due to the positive general AI trend, while others are more cautious (0.55 probability), emphasizing the lack of company-specific information.  One model even predicted a fall (0.3 probability) based on unrelated negative news about Apple's performance in China.  Considering the lack of direct, Apple-specific information, and the diversity of opinions from previous predictions, I'm leaning towards a neutral outlook. While the overall AI trend is positive, its impact on Apple's stock price may be diffused and dependent on other factors.  Therefore, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise reflecting the general market sentiment toward AI but acknowledging the absence of concrete Apple-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a critical market for the company, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% decline in Q4 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This underperformance is attributed to strong competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which have shown substantial growth. Given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's revenue and growth, this news is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's loss of market share suggests challenges in maintaining its premium positioning. Previous predictions from other models also indicate mixed sentiments, but the direct negative impact of losing ground in a key market outweighs any indirect positive factors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs. This development could be viewed as a positive move by investors, as it may indicate a strengthening of Apple's financial services offerings and a potential reduction in dependence on Goldman Sachs. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the terms of the partnership and the market's perception of the news. Given the neutral to positive tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the market and how the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in AI. This trend is expected to drive growth in the market, with the AI market projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030. As Apple is one of the companies making big moves into AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing probability of stock price rise, with some models predicting a higher probability of rise than fall. However, it's also important to consider the cautionary note in the article about not putting all savings into AI stocks and the importance of diversification. Overall, the positive sentiment towards AI and Apple's involvement in it suggests a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large tech companies in AI technologies, positioning Apple as one of them. Given Apple's track record and the trend towards AI-driven innovations, it is likely that such investments will positively influence investor sentiment and potentially boost the stock price. Previous predictions from other models also suggest a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising. This suggests a continued positive outlook for Apple due to its AI investments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the U.S. presents a mixed impact on Apple Inc.'s stock price. On one hand, the removal of a competitor like TikTok could drive users towards Apple's ecosystem, possibly increasing sales of Apple devices. However, the ban would also negatively impact Apple's App Store revenues due to decreased user engagement and app downloads, which are crucial for its services segment. Considering the analysis of previous predictions, there are indications of a slight inclination towards a price rise due to potential increased device sales; however, the risks related to app revenue suggest a balance that leans slightly more towards a decline. Thus, I estimate a probability of stock price rise around 0.51, and a probability of stock price fall around 0.49.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple CEO Tim Cook's involvement and contributions to Trump's inauguration. Given Trump's pro-business stance, the argument is that Apple will gain favor on important issues, thereby boosting the stock price. Although previous rounds are diverse, the average score rose from the initial to the following round. I will increase probability of rise, while also recognizing potential for political risks of aligning with a controversial figure causing backlash. Taking into account prior scores and current news, I'll adjust to reflect increased positives of this political alignment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline is broadly positive for Apple, as it highlights the increasing importance of AI and positions Apple as a key player in this growing sector.  However, the news itself lacks concrete details about Apple's specific AI initiatives or their immediate impact on the company's financials.  Therefore, any stock price movement is likely to be moderate and driven more by general market sentiment towards AI rather than company-specific news.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a range of opinions, with some models predicting a high probability of a price rise due to the overall positive AI trend, while others are more cautious due to a lack of concrete Apple-specific news. Some models even incorporated unrelated negative news affecting Apple's predictions.  Considering this divergence and the lack of direct information regarding Apple's AI advancements in the news, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the general market positivity towards AI investments across the tech sector. However, the absence of company-specific information necessitates a more conservative prediction than some of the prior high estimates.  The overall trend towards a slight increase in the probability of a price rise throughout the rounds is also considered.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a critical market for the company, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% decline in Q4 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This underperformance is attributed to strong competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which have shown substantial growth. Given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's revenue and growth, this news is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's loss of market share suggests challenges in maintaining its premium positioning. Previous predictions from other models also indicate mixed sentiments, but the direct negative impact of losing ground in a key market outweighs any indirect positive factors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the market and how the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in AI. This trend is expected to drive growth in the market, with the AI market projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030. As Apple is one of the companies making big moves into AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing probability of stock price rise, with some models predicting a higher probability of rise than fall. However, it's also important to consider the cautionary note in the article about not putting all savings into AI stocks and the importance of diversification. Overall, the positive sentiment towards AI and Apple's involvement in it suggests a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's participation and significant moves in AI alongside the top global companies. This aligns with the industry trend where AI is driving growth, which could positively impact investor sentiment towards AI-driven companies like Apple. Most previous predictions indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising, influenced by the positive outlook on AI investments by major corporations. Additionally, the cautionary note in the news suggests a balanced approach to investment, which might support ongoing confidence. The trend of predictions shows an increasing likelihood of a stock price rise.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, it could reduce competition in the social media landscape, potentially driving users towards Apple's ecosystem and increasing device sales. However, the ban poses risks to Apple's services revenue, as the removal of TikTok would likely decrease app engagement and downloads on the App Store, which are crucial for Apple's financial performance. Analyzing the previous predictions reflects a balance of positive sentiment related to increased device sales against the risks of decreased revenue from app downloads. Therefore, the probabilities indicate a slight edge towards a decline in stock price, reflecting caution among investors regarding the overall impact of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's CEO Tim Cook's participation in Trump's inauguration, and the broader trend of tech executives cozying up to the new administration. While there is a risk of backlash from aligning with a controversial figure, the primary narrative is that being in Trump's good graces could benefit Apple through favorable policy decisions on tariffs and antitrust matters. Given previous predictions, which indicate a general increase in the probability of a price rise due to positive sentiment, and the fact that Cook has historically had a good relationship with Trump, I am nudging the probability of a rise higher. Note that some models in the previous rounds were related to AI. Although this news does not mention directly about AI trend, Apple's relationship with the government is probably the most relevant factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is broadly positive, highlighting Apple's position among the top companies investing in AI.  This is generally good for investor sentiment and the tech sector. However, the headline lacks specifics about Apple's AI strategy or its direct impact on the company's financials.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting this uncertainty. Some show a strong bias toward a price rise due to the general AI trend, while others are more cautious, citing the lack of Apple-specific details or highlighting negative news about Apple's performance in China.  The trend across rounds shows a slight increase in the predicted probability of a price rise, but this increase is gradual and not drastic. Considering the inherent ambiguity in the news and the range of opinions from other models, I will provide a prediction that leans slightly toward a price rise, reflecting the positive sentiment related to the broader AI investment trend, but acknowledges the absence of direct Apple-specific information in the news itself. The probabilities are moderate, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a critical market for the company, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% decline in Q4 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.
