(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't\nNews Content: By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The ban on TikTok could lead to increased sales for Apple as users may need to purchase new devices or adjust their settings to access alternative apps. However, it also poses risks, as Apple's App Store will be directly impacted by the removal of TikTok, potentially leading to decreased user engagement and revenue from app downloads. Overall, the potential for increased device sales might outweigh the risks in the short term, supporting a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a potentially positive, or at least neutral, outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to its CEO's willingness to engage with a potentially pro-business Trump administration. Tim Cook's established relationship with Trump, potential influence on tariff policies (beneficial for Apple's manufacturing), and antitrust issues could all be positively addressed with an open channel to the White House. While political donations are normal, Trump's emphasis on loyalty suggests that proactive engagement could benefit companies. This suggests reduced risk and opportunity for influence with policy and regulation, leading to an estimated slightly higher probability of a stock rise than fall. However, the article also highlights potential downsides. Aligning with a controversial political figure can alienate parts of Apple's customer base, creating short-term volatility. The overall market sentiment and other company-specific news will play major roles, which are impossible to predict from this headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights that nine of the top ten global companies are investing heavily in AI. While this is generally positive for the tech sector and might boost investor sentiment, the impact on Apple specifically is indirect.  The news doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's AI initiatives beyond the implication of their presence among the top ten players. Therefore, any price movement is likely to be subdued and driven more by general market trends related to AI rather than company-specific news.  We should expect some positive sentiment leading to a slight increase in probability of price rise, but this will be modest due to lack of specific news about Apple's AI plans.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost significant ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% decline in Q4 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which have shown substantial growth. Given that China is a critical market for Apple, this loss of market share is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and could lead to downward pressure on the stock price. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's underperformance relative to competitors suggests potential challenges in maintaining its premium positioning and growth trajectory in the region.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs. This development could be viewed as a positive move by investors, as it may indicate a strengthening of Apple's financial services offerings and a potential reduction in dependence on Goldman Sachs. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the terms of the partnership and the market's perception of the news. Given the neutral to positive tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the market and how the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in AI. This trend is expected to drive growth in the market, with the AI market projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030. As Apple is one of the companies making big moves into AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. The article also mentions that the top 10 companies, including Apple, have a combined market cap of over $19 trillion, which is significantly larger than the next tier of companies, indicating a strong market presence and potential for growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large tech companies in AI technologies, positioning Apple as one of them. Given Apple's track record and the trend towards AI-driven innovations, it is likely that such investments will positively influence investor sentiment and potentially boost the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban in the U.S. could present a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the removal of TikTok, a major competitor in the social media space, could drive users towards Apple's ecosystem, potentially increasing sales of Apple devices as users look for alternatives. However, there are significant risks involved; the removal of TikTok would directly affect Apple's App Store revenues due to decreased engagement and downloads, which is critical for its services segment. Comparatively, previous predictions lean toward a slight positive sentiment owing to Apple's broader market position. Therefore, while there is some potential for an uptick in stock price due to increased device sales, the risks associated with app engagement and revenue streams suggest a balance of probabilities slightly favoring a decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) as its CEO, Tim Cook, is attending Trump's inauguration and has historically maintained a good relationship with him. This suggests that Apple could have a favorable position in discussions regarding tariffs and antitrust issues under the new administration. While the news also mentions that other tech executives are cozying up to Trump for various reasons, Tim Cook's established relationship with Trump indicates that there are minimal unknowns and Apple has a chance of leveraging this to bring pro-Apple policies influencing a stock rise. The other models had varying predictions, most indicating a higher chance of stock price rise with some indicating a stock price fall. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline is broadly positive for the tech sector, highlighting increased AI investment by major players including Apple. However, the news lacks specifics about Apple's AI strategy or its immediate impact on the company's financials.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a significant rise (0.8 probability) due to the positive general AI trend, while others are more cautious (0.55 probability), emphasizing the lack of company-specific information.  One model even predicted a fall (0.3 probability) based on unrelated negative news about Apple's performance in China.  Considering the lack of direct, Apple-specific information, and the diversity of opinions from previous predictions, I'm leaning towards a neutral outlook. While the overall AI trend is positive, its impact on Apple's stock price may be diffused and dependent on other factors.  Therefore, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise reflecting the general market sentiment toward AI but acknowledging the absence of concrete Apple-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a critical market for the company, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% decline in Q4 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This underperformance is attributed to strong competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which have shown substantial growth. Given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's revenue and growth, this news is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's loss of market share suggests challenges in maintaining its premium positioning. Previous predictions from other models also indicate mixed sentiments, but the direct negative impact of losing ground in a key market outweighs any indirect positive factors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs. This development could be viewed as a positive move by investors, as it may indicate a strengthening of Apple's financial services offerings and a potential reduction in dependence on Goldman Sachs. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the terms of the partnership and the market's perception of the news. Given the neutral to positive tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the market and how the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in AI. This trend is expected to drive growth in the market, with the AI market projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030. As Apple is one of the companies making big moves into AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing probability of stock price rise, with some models predicting a higher probability of rise than fall. However, it's also important to consider the cautionary note in the article about not putting all savings into AI stocks and the importance of diversification. Overall, the positive sentiment towards AI and Apple's involvement in it suggests a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large tech companies in AI technologies, positioning Apple as one of them. Given Apple's track record and the trend towards AI-driven innovations, it is likely that such investments will positively influence investor sentiment and potentially boost the stock price. Previous predictions from other models also suggest a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising. This suggests a continued positive outlook for Apple due to its AI investments.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
