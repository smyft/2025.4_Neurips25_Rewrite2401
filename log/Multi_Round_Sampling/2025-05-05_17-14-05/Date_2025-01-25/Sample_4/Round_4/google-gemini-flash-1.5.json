(AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock. These selections are derived from sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, given their historical resilience and stability even during economic downturns. A considerable number of these stocks present enticing annual dividend yields and possess defensive attributes that enable them to maintain stability in a bear market. Additionally, we\u2019ve identified promising tech stocks that currently pose as appealing entry opportunities for investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company emerges as a prime investment opportunity for several reasons. First and foremost, the company\u2019s robust financial health is depicted in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue was $94.9 billion, increasing 6% year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share was $0.97. This shows the increasing demand for the company\u2019s products or services and its ability to generate earnings for shareholders. Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2024, the company declared quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, totaling $0.96 per share annually. Secondly, the company has also introduced a general health-monitoring tool in all its new devices. For instance, an Apple Watch can monitor heart rate, check for atrial fibrillation, detect falls and car crashes, monitor blood-oxygen levels, and track body temperature for fertility planning.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolution of major tech stock groupings, including Apple, which remains a part of high-performing segments such as BATMMAAN. This indicates continued interest and investment in large-cap tech stocks, likely enhancing market sentiment around Apple. Given that Apple is included among the stocks showing strong performance historically and in various market analyses, this news could contribute positively to investor confidence and potentially drive a rise in stock price. However, any significant market changes or macroeconomic factors could temper this optimism, suggesting a balanced risk as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts),  the overall economic climate is uncertain. Several experts predict a potential bear market, citing high inflation, interest rate concerns, and the possibility of a recession, though the probability of a recession is relatively low at 22%.  Counteracting this bearish sentiment is Apple's strong financial results and inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks,' suggesting some resilience. The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is considered a contrary indicator historically, suggesting potential market peaks and thus a bearish signal.  The article also highlights Apple's expansion into AI features as a positive factor.  However, the article itself presents Apple as a *good* but not the *best* bear market investment, implying relatively lower upside potential compared to other stocks mentioned.  Given the conflicting signals and the article's own qualification of Apple's prospects, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral movement or a small decline than a strong rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low, but given the neutral nature, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could positively impact the stock price. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of large-cap stock acronyms and highlights Apple's inclusion in the emerging BATMMAAN group, suggesting that it continues to be part of high-performing segments in the tech industry. This affiliation with strong-performing stocks can buoy investor sentiment. However, some mixed signals persist regarding Apple's recent struggles, including analyst downgrades, performance issues in China, and concerns raised in previous predictions. Given the overall positive sentiment stemming from Apple's inclusion in a favorable grouping, but tempered by concerns about its recent performance, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising balanced against a notable chance of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline explicitly states that Apple has received a rare Underperform rating. This is a strong signal of negative sentiment from a Wall Street analyst, which typically leads to downward pressure on a stock. While Apple is a fundamentally strong company, analyst ratings can significantly influence investor behavior, particularly when the rating is a rare 'Underperform'. Considering this negative catalyst, and factoring in the previous rounds where many models leaned towards neutral or bearish scenarios (with some exceptions that may be based on non-provided information), I'm increasing the probability of a stock price fall. The magnitude of the fall will depend on the specific analyst's reputation and the overall market conditions, but the initial reaction is likely negative. Previous predictions were quite varied, so I am weighting the explicit news more heavily.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  Positive factors include Apple's strong Q4 2024 financials (revenue growth, dividend), its inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and its expanding AI features.  However, significant counterarguments exist.  The prevailing economic sentiment is cautious optimism, with experts forecasting potential market corrections or even a bear market, fueled by inflation and interest rate concerns.  The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is viewed as a historically bearish indicator.  Furthermore, while Apple is considered a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns.  The range of predictions from other models (from 0.3 to 0.65 for a price rise) further reflects this uncertainty.  Considering the balanced arguments and the potential for broad market downturn impacting even resilient stocks, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, though the difference is not significant.  The overall uncertainty warrants a conservative approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected, assigning a moderate probability of rising and a low probability of falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.

Considering the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report, as well as the overall positive trend in the tech industry, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising and falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk. Previous predictions vary widely, indicating mixed sentiments among analysts. Considering the broad positive trend but acknowledging ongoing challenges, the estimated probabilities lean towards slight positive movement.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of major tech stock groupings, which includes Apple as part of a high-performing segment, potentially enhancing sentiment toward the stock. However, previous predictions highlight mixed signals regarding Apple's recent struggles, such as analyst downgrades and external economic factors which could influence performance negatively. Weighing the positive inclusion in a favorable grouping against the concerns about Apple's recent performance, a moderate probability of the stock price rising is estimated, tempered by a notable chance of falling due to lingering negative factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline directly announces a rare 'Underperform' rating, which is a strong negative signal. This is a significant piece of information that outweighs previous, more general, analyses. Many models in Round 1 shifted towards a more bearish stance after considering the explicit negative news. I am weighing this explicit negative signal heavily. While Apple is generally considered a strong company, negative analyst ratings, especially rare and strong ones, can drive significant selling pressure. The previous predictions show a wide range, indicating uncertainty, but the trend, particularly in Round 1, adjusts toward increased bearishness once the specific negative headline is presented. Therefore, I am assigning a high probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for AAPL.  Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 financials, inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and expanding AI features.  However, significant negative factors exist.  The overall economic climate is uncertain, with experts forecasting potential market corrections or a bear market due to inflation and interest rate concerns. The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is a historically bearish indicator.  While AAPL is considered a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns. Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting this uncertainty.  Considering these conflicting signals and the potential for a broader market downturn, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.  The uncertainty warrants a conservative approach. I'm also considering the trend in previous predictions: while initially optimistic, subsequent rounds show a shift toward bearish sentiment.  This suggests a convergence of opinion toward a more negative outlook, which I factor into my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term. However, Apple's strong brand authority and loyal customer base provide some counterbalance, leading to a slightly tempered view on the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Given the neutral nature of the news, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected. However, considering the previous predictions and the general trend in the tech industry, there seems to be a cautious outlook due to mixed signals and uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.

Considering the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report, as well as the overall positive trend in the tech industry and the provided predictions from other models, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising and falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk. Previous predictions vary widely, indicating mixed sentiments among analysts. Considering the broad positive trend but acknowledging ongoing challenges, the estimated probabilities lean towards slight positive movement.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of tech stock groupings, indicating sustained interest in mega-cap stocks, including Apple, which is now part of the BATMMAAN group. This inclusion generally enhances market sentiment around Apple. However, significant factors such as underperform ratings from analysts, concerns about recent performance, and external economic challenges from inflation and potential market corrections are impacting investor sentiment negatively. The previous predictions reflect a mixture of optimism due to Apple's strong financial track record and negative pressures from analyst ratings and declining sales in certain markets. Overall, while Apple's inclusion in prominent stock groupings suggests a higher probability of price rise, the existing negative sentiments necessitate a more cautious and balanced estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline presents a direct negative signal: a rare Underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst. This carries significant weight, especially considering the observed trend in previous rounds where initial optimism shifted towards bearish sentiment after acknowledging the specific negative news. While Apple has strengths, analyst ratings, particularly negative ones, often influence investor behavior and can lead to sell-offs. I'm factoring in the opinions provided in the previous runs to assess current sentiment, and it appears the news is overwhelmingly negative. I thus predict the probability of the stock price to fall is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 financials, its inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and expansion into AI. However, significant negative factors outweigh these.  The overall economic climate is uncertain, with experts predicting market corrections or a bear market due to inflation and high interest rates.  The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is historically a bearish indicator.  Although Apple is deemed a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns.  The 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst is a significant negative signal and adds weight to the bearish sentiment.  Previous predictions show a gradual trend toward bearishness, with many models lowering their probability of a price rise after considering the negative news. Considering these conflicting signals and the potential for broader market downturn, the probability of a price fall is higher. The consistent downward trend in predictions across rounds reinforces the negative outlook.  I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect the weight of the negative news and the overall trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc.

However, considering the previous predictions and the general trend in the tech industry, there seems to be a cautious outlook due to mixed signals and uncertainties. The probabilities are also influenced by the fact that many models previously provided mixed sentiments, with a slight inclination towards bearishness due to various factors such as analyst downgrades, performance issues in China, and concerns about Apple's AI strategy.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc.
