      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolution of major tech stock groupings, including Apple, which remains a part of high-performing segments such as BATMMAAN. This indicates continued interest and investment in large-cap tech stocks, likely enhancing market sentiment around Apple. Given that Apple is included among the stocks showing strong performance historically and in various market analyses, this news could contribute positively to investor confidence and potentially drive a rise in stock price. However, any significant market changes or macroeconomic factors could temper this optimism, suggesting a balanced risk as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts),  the overall economic climate is uncertain. Several experts predict a potential bear market, citing high inflation, interest rate concerns, and the possibility of a recession, though the probability of a recession is relatively low at 22%.  Counteracting this bearish sentiment is Apple's strong financial results and inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks,' suggesting some resilience. The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is considered a contrary indicator historically, suggesting potential market peaks and thus a bearish signal.  The article also highlights Apple's expansion into AI features as a positive factor.  However, the article itself presents Apple as a *good* but not the *best* bear market investment, implying relatively lower upside potential compared to other stocks mentioned.  Given the conflicting signals and the article's own qualification of Apple's prospects, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral movement or a small decline than a strong rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low, but given the neutral nature, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could positively impact the stock price. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of large-cap stock acronyms and highlights Apple's inclusion in the emerging BATMMAAN group, suggesting that it continues to be part of high-performing segments in the tech industry. This affiliation with strong-performing stocks can buoy investor sentiment. However, some mixed signals persist regarding Apple's recent struggles, including analyst downgrades, performance issues in China, and concerns raised in previous predictions. Given the overall positive sentiment stemming from Apple's inclusion in a favorable grouping, but tempered by concerns about its recent performance, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising balanced against a notable chance of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline explicitly states that Apple has received a rare Underperform rating. This is a strong signal of negative sentiment from a Wall Street analyst, which typically leads to downward pressure on a stock. While Apple is a fundamentally strong company, analyst ratings can significantly influence investor behavior, particularly when the rating is a rare 'Underperform'. Considering this negative catalyst, and factoring in the previous rounds where many models leaned towards neutral or bearish scenarios (with some exceptions that may be based on non-provided information), I'm increasing the probability of a stock price fall. The magnitude of the fall will depend on the specific analyst's reputation and the overall market conditions, but the initial reaction is likely negative. Previous predictions were quite varied, so I am weighting the explicit news more heavily.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  Positive factors include Apple's strong Q4 2024 financials (revenue growth, dividend), its inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and its expanding AI features.  However, significant counterarguments exist.  The prevailing economic sentiment is cautious optimism, with experts forecasting potential market corrections or even a bear market, fueled by inflation and interest rate concerns.  The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is viewed as a historically bearish indicator.  Furthermore, while Apple is considered a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns.  The range of predictions from other models (from 0.3 to 0.65 for a price rise) further reflects this uncertainty.  Considering the balanced arguments and the potential for broad market downturn impacting even resilient stocks, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, though the difference is not significant.  The overall uncertainty warrants a conservative approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected, assigning a moderate probability of rising and a low probability of falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could positively impact the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report, as well as the overall positive trend in the tech industry, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising and falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk. Previous predictions vary widely, indicating mixed sentiments among analysts. Considering the broad positive trend but acknowledging ongoing challenges, the estimated probabilities lean towards slight positive movement.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of major tech stock groupings, which includes Apple as part of a high-performing segment, potentially enhancing sentiment toward the stock. However, previous predictions highlight mixed signals regarding Apple's recent struggles, such as analyst downgrades and external economic factors which could influence performance negatively. Weighing the positive inclusion in a favorable grouping against the concerns about Apple's recent performance, a moderate probability of the stock price rising is estimated, tempered by a notable chance of falling due to lingering negative factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline directly announces a rare 'Underperform' rating, which is a strong negative signal. This is a significant piece of information that outweighs previous, more general, analyses. Many models in Round 1 shifted towards a more bearish stance after considering the explicit negative news. I am weighing this explicit negative signal heavily. While Apple is generally considered a strong company, negative analyst ratings, especially rare and strong ones, can drive significant selling pressure. The previous predictions show a wide range, indicating uncertainty, but the trend, particularly in Round 1, adjusts toward increased bearishness once the specific negative headline is presented. Therefore, I am assigning a high probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for AAPL.  Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 financials, inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and expanding AI features.  However, significant negative factors exist.  The overall economic climate is uncertain, with experts forecasting potential market corrections or a bear market due to inflation and interest rate concerns. The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is a historically bearish indicator.  While AAPL is considered a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns. Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting this uncertainty.  Considering these conflicting signals and the potential for a broader market downturn, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.  The uncertainty warrants a conservative approach. I'm also considering the trend in previous predictions: while initially optimistic, subsequent rounds show a shift toward bearish sentiment.  This suggests a convergence of opinion toward a more negative outlook, which I factor into my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term. However, Apple's strong brand authority and loyal customer base provide some counterbalance, leading to a slightly tempered view on the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Given the neutral nature of the news, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected. However, considering the previous predictions and the general trend in the tech industry, there seems to be a cautious outlook due to mixed signals and uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could positively impact the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report, as well as the overall positive trend in the tech industry and the provided predictions from other models, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising and falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk. Previous predictions vary widely, indicating mixed sentiments among analysts. Considering the broad positive trend but acknowledging ongoing challenges, the estimated probabilities lean towards slight positive movement.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of tech stock groupings, indicating sustained interest in mega-cap stocks, including Apple, which is now part of the BATMMAAN group. This inclusion generally enhances market sentiment around Apple. However, significant factors such as underperform ratings from analysts, concerns about recent performance, and external economic challenges from inflation and potential market corrections are impacting investor sentiment negatively. The previous predictions reflect a mixture of optimism due to Apple's strong financial track record and negative pressures from analyst ratings and declining sales in certain markets. Overall, while Apple's inclusion in prominent stock groupings suggests a higher probability of price rise, the existing negative sentiments necessitate a more cautious and balanced estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline presents a direct negative signal: a rare Underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst. This carries significant weight, especially considering the observed trend in previous rounds where initial optimism shifted towards bearish sentiment after acknowledging the specific negative news. While Apple has strengths, analyst ratings, particularly negative ones, often influence investor behavior and can lead to sell-offs. I'm factoring in the opinions provided in the previous runs to assess current sentiment, and it appears the news is overwhelmingly negative. I thus predict the probability of the stock price to fall is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 financials, its inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and expansion into AI. However, significant negative factors outweigh these.  The overall economic climate is uncertain, with experts predicting market corrections or a bear market due to inflation and high interest rates.  The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is historically a bearish indicator.  Although Apple is deemed a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns.  The 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst is a significant negative signal and adds weight to the bearish sentiment.  Previous predictions show a gradual trend toward bearishness, with many models lowering their probability of a price rise after considering the negative news. Considering these conflicting signals and the potential for broader market downturn, the probability of a price fall is higher. The consistent downward trend in predictions across rounds reinforces the negative outlook.  I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect the weight of the negative news and the overall trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc.

The probabilities are also influenced by the fact that many models previously provided mixed sentiments, with a slight inclination towards bearishness due to various factors such as analyst downgrades, performance issues in China, and concerns about Apple's AI strategy.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc.
