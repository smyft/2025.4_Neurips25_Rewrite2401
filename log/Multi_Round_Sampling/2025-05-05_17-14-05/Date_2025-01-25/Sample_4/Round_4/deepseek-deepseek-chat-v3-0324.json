(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolution of major tech stock groupings, including Apple, which remains a part of high-performing segments such as BATMMAAN. This indicates continued interest and investment in large-cap tech stocks, likely enhancing market sentiment around Apple. Given that Apple is included among the stocks showing strong performance historically and in various market analyses, this news could contribute positively to investor confidence and potentially drive a rise in stock price. However, any significant market changes or macroeconomic factors could temper this optimism, suggesting a balanced risk as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts),  the overall economic climate is uncertain. Several experts predict a potential bear market, citing high inflation, interest rate concerns, and the possibility of a recession, though the probability of a recession is relatively low at 22%.  Counteracting this bearish sentiment is Apple's strong financial results and inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks,' suggesting some resilience. The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is considered a contrary indicator historically, suggesting potential market peaks and thus a bearish signal.  The article also highlights Apple's expansion into AI features as a positive factor.  However, the article itself presents Apple as a *good* but not the *best* bear market investment, implying relatively lower upside potential compared to other stocks mentioned.  Given the conflicting signals and the article's own qualification of Apple's prospects, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral movement or a small decline than a strong rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low, but given the neutral nature, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could positively impact the stock price. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of large-cap stock acronyms and highlights Apple's inclusion in the emerging BATMMAAN group, suggesting that it continues to be part of high-performing segments in the tech industry. This affiliation with strong-performing stocks can buoy investor sentiment. However, some mixed signals persist regarding Apple's recent struggles, including analyst downgrades, performance issues in China, and concerns raised in previous predictions. Given the overall positive sentiment stemming from Apple's inclusion in a favorable grouping, but tempered by concerns about its recent performance, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising balanced against a notable chance of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline explicitly states that Apple has received a rare Underperform rating. This is a strong signal of negative sentiment from a Wall Street analyst, which typically leads to downward pressure on a stock. While Apple is a fundamentally strong company, analyst ratings can significantly influence investor behavior, particularly when the rating is a rare 'Underperform'. Considering this negative catalyst, and factoring in the previous rounds where many models leaned towards neutral or bearish scenarios (with some exceptions that may be based on non-provided information), I'm increasing the probability of a stock price fall. The magnitude of the fall will depend on the specific analyst's reputation and the overall market conditions, but the initial reaction is likely negative. Previous predictions were quite varied, so I am weighting the explicit news more heavily.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  Positive factors include Apple's strong Q4 2024 financials (revenue growth, dividend), its inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and its expanding AI features.  However, significant counterarguments exist.  The prevailing economic sentiment is cautious optimism, with experts forecasting potential market corrections or even a bear market, fueled by inflation and interest rate concerns.  The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is viewed as a historically bearish indicator.  Furthermore, while Apple is considered a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns.  The range of predictions from other models (from 0.3 to 0.65 for a price rise) further reflects this uncertainty.  Considering the balanced arguments and the potential for broad market downturn impacting even resilient stocks, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, though the difference is not significant.  The overall uncertainty warrants a conservative approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected, assigning a moderate probability of rising and a low probability of falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.

However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk. Previous predictions vary widely, indicating mixed sentiments among analysts. Considering the broad positive trend but acknowledging ongoing challenges, the estimated probabilities lean towards slight positive movement.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of major tech stock groupings, which includes Apple as part of a high-performing segment, potentially enhancing sentiment toward the stock. However, previous predictions highlight mixed signals regarding Apple's recent struggles, such as analyst downgrades and external economic factors which could influence performance negatively. Weighing the positive inclusion in a favorable grouping against the concerns about Apple's recent performance, a moderate probability of the stock price rising is estimated, tempered by a notable chance of falling due to lingering negative factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline directly announces a rare 'Underperform' rating, which is a strong negative signal. This is a significant piece of information that outweighs previous, more general, analyses. Many models in Round 1 shifted towards a more bearish stance after considering the explicit negative news. I am weighing this explicit negative signal heavily. While Apple is generally considered a strong company, negative analyst ratings, especially rare and strong ones, can drive significant selling pressure. The previous predictions show a wide range, indicating uncertainty, but the trend, particularly in Round 1, adjusts toward increased bearishness once the specific negative headline is presented. Therefore, I am assigning a high probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for AAPL.  Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 financials, inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and expanding AI features.  However, significant negative factors exist.  The overall economic climate is uncertain, with experts forecasting potential market corrections or a bear market due to inflation and interest rate concerns. The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is a historically bearish indicator.  While AAPL is considered a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns. Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting this uncertainty.  Considering these conflicting signals and the potential for a broader market downturn, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall.  The uncertainty warrants a conservative approach. I'm also considering the trend in previous predictions: while initially optimistic, subsequent rounds show a shift toward bearish sentiment.  This suggests a convergence of opinion toward a more negative outlook, which I factor into my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term. However, Apple's strong brand authority and loyal customer base provide some counterbalance, leading to a slightly tempered view on the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc.

Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Given the neutral nature of the news, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected. However, considering the previous predictions and the general trend in the tech industry, there seems to be a cautious outlook due to mixed signals and uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc.

However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk. Previous predictions vary widely, indicating mixed sentiments among analysts. Considering the broad positive trend but acknowledging ongoing challenges, the estimated probabilities lean towards slight positive movement.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of tech stock groupings, indicating sustained interest in mega-cap stocks, including Apple, which is now part of the BATMMAAN group. This inclusion generally enhances market sentiment around Apple. However, significant factors such as underperform ratings from analysts, concerns about recent performance, and external economic challenges from inflation and potential market corrections are impacting investor sentiment negatively. The previous predictions reflect a mixture of optimism due to Apple's strong financial track record and negative pressures from analyst ratings and declining sales in certain markets. Overall, while Apple's inclusion in prominent stock groupings suggests a higher probability of price rise, the existing negative sentiments necessitate a more cautious and balanced estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline presents a direct negative signal: a rare Underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst. This carries significant weight, especially considering the observed trend in previous rounds where initial optimism shifted towards bearish sentiment after acknowledging the specific negative news. While Apple has strengths, analyst ratings, particularly negative ones, often influence investor behavior and can lead to sell-offs. I'm factoring in the opinions provided in the previous runs to assess current sentiment, and it appears the news is overwhelmingly negative. I thus predict the probability of the stock price to fall is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 financials, its inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and expansion into AI. However, significant negative factors outweigh these.  The overall economic climate is uncertain, with experts predicting market corrections or a bear market due to inflation and high interest rates.  The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is historically a bearish indicator.  Although Apple is deemed a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns.  The 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst is a significant negative signal and adds weight to the bearish sentiment.  Previous predictions show a gradual trend toward bearishness, with many models lowering their probability of a price rise after considering the negative news. Considering these conflicting signals and the potential for broader market downturn, the probability of a price fall is higher. The consistent downward trend in predictions across rounds reinforces the negative outlook.  I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect the weight of the negative news and the overall trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc.

However, considering the previous predictions and the general trend in the tech industry, there seems to be a cautious outlook due to mixed signals and uncertainties. The probabilities are also influenced by the fact that many models previously provided mixed sentiments, with a slight inclination towards bearishness due to various factors such as analyst downgrades, performance issues in China, and concerns about Apple's AI strategy.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc.
