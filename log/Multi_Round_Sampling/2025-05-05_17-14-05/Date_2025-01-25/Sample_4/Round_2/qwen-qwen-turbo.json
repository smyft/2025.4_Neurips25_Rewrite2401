Wall Street's biggest worry is whether momentum can last.\nNews Content: For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.\n\nIn 2024, that finally changed.\n\nThe five giants \u2014 Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) \u2014 collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNetflix led the charge, pulling in roughly $6.9 billion in earnings in the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the company the unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reported an additional $1.87 billion in profits to end the fourth quarter \u2014 and nearly 20 million more subscribers.\n\nThe other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.\n\nLast year delivered some early answers. Disney and Paramount Global each reported their first quarter of streaming profits in August. Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as \"progress,\" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.\n\nFor Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is \"the pace of revenue growth.\" He added, \"To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.\"\n\nFor traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. \"Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.\n\nThat low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns. Lourdes Balduque via Getty Images\n\nIn response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers through controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.\n\nCompanies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.\n\n\"Everything was kind of messy for a few years,\" Macquarie's Nollen said. \"Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.\"\n\n(edited)\n\nOne obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. (Netflix became the latest platform to boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)\n\n\"The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,\" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, \"there's a limit\" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.\n\n\"Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,\" he said.\n\nTo combat fickle subscribers, competing platforms are now bundling their services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, \"There's more strength together.\"\n\n\"I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,\" Dolgin said. \"So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.\"\n\nAnd if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix \u2014 and just basic survival in the streaming-first era \u2014 might be a bumpy one.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NFLX)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolution of major tech stock groupings, including Apple, which remains a part of high-performing segments such as BATMMAAN. This indicates continued interest and investment in large-cap tech stocks, likely enhancing market sentiment around Apple. Given that Apple is included among the stocks showing strong performance historically and in various market analyses, this news could contribute positively to investor confidence and potentially drive a rise in stock price. However, any significant market changes or macroeconomic factors could temper this optimism, suggesting a balanced risk as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts),  the overall economic climate is uncertain. Several experts predict a potential bear market, citing high inflation, interest rate concerns, and the possibility of a recession, though the probability of a recession is relatively low at 22%.  Counteracting this bearish sentiment is Apple's strong financial results and inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks,' suggesting some resilience. The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is considered a contrary indicator historically, suggesting potential market peaks and thus a bearish signal.  The article also highlights Apple's expansion into AI features as a positive factor.  However, the article itself presents Apple as a *good* but not the *best* bear market investment, implying relatively lower upside potential compared to other stocks mentioned.  Given the conflicting signals and the article's own qualification of Apple's prospects, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral movement or a small decline than a strong rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low, but given the neutral nature, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could positively impact the stock price. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of large-cap stock acronyms and highlights Apple's inclusion in the emerging BATMMAAN group, suggesting that it continues to be part of high-performing segments in the tech industry. This affiliation with strong-performing stocks can buoy investor sentiment. However, some mixed signals persist regarding Apple's recent struggles, including analyst downgrades, performance issues in China, and concerns raised in previous predictions. Given the overall positive sentiment stemming from Apple's inclusion in a favorable grouping, but tempered by concerns about its recent performance, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising balanced against a notable chance of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline explicitly states that Apple has received a rare Underperform rating. This is a strong signal of negative sentiment from a Wall Street analyst, which typically leads to downward pressure on a stock. While Apple is a fundamentally strong company, analyst ratings can significantly influence investor behavior, particularly when the rating is a rare 'Underperform'. Considering this negative catalyst, and factoring in the previous rounds where many models leaned towards neutral or bearish scenarios (with some exceptions that may be based on non-provided information), I'm increasing the probability of a stock price fall. The magnitude of the fall will depend on the specific analyst's reputation and the overall market conditions, but the initial reaction is likely negative. Previous predictions were quite varied, so I am weighting the explicit news more heavily.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  Positive factors include Apple's strong Q4 2024 financials (revenue growth, dividend), its inclusion in a list of best bear market stocks, and its expanding AI features.  However, significant counterarguments exist.  The prevailing economic sentiment is cautious optimism, with experts forecasting potential market corrections or even a bear market, fueled by inflation and interest rate concerns.  The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is viewed as a historically bearish indicator.  Furthermore, while Apple is considered a good bear market investment, the article suggests other stocks offer potentially higher returns.  The range of predictions from other models (from 0.3 to 0.65 for a price rise) further reflects this uncertainty.  Considering the balanced arguments and the potential for broad market downturn impacting even resilient stocks, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, though the difference is not significant.  The overall uncertainty warrants a conservative approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and a lackluster response to new AI features.

The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I would slightly bias towards the stock not being negatively affected, assigning a moderate probability of rising and a low probability of falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc.

Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk. Previous predictions vary widely, indicating mixed sentiments among analysts.
