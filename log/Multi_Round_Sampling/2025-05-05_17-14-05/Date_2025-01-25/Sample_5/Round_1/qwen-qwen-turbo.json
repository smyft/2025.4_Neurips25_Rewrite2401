(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones\nNews Content: BT van\n\nBT has called for a competition crackdown on Apple over concerns the tech giant could use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks.\n\nThe operator has raised concerns that the rise of virtual \u201ceSims\u201d that replace Sim cards could see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.\n\nIn a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: \u201cWe also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d\n\nPhysical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and its rivals risk losing ground to the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.\n\nThe threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.\n\nBT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.\n\nHowever, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.\n\nKester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: \u201cOne of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there\u2019s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that\u2019s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.\u201d\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks \u2013 similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile \u2013 though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.\n\neSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.\n\nApple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.\n\nBT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: \u201cIncreased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.\u201d\n\nVodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.\n\nApple did not comment on the BT submission.\n\nIn response to last week\u2019s CMA investigation it said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple could signal a loss of confidence among significant investors, especially given his history of successful trades. Coupled with declining iPhone sales in China and potential revenue losses from a court ruling regarding default search placements with Google, there are significant concerns about Apple's future profitability. Meanwhile, the stock's high valuation relative to earnings and analysts' views on a lack of upgrade cycles add further downward pressure. Thus, these factors contribute to a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These factors significantly outweigh Cohen's action, as his trade occurred in a previous quarter. The article concludes with a strong negative sentiment towards Apple stock. Conversely, the news presents a more bullish outlook for Axon Enterprise, highlighting its strong financial performance, market leadership, and significant growth potential in a large addressable market. While its valuation is high, its consistent earnings beat history is mentioned as a positive.  However, the focus is primarily on Apple, so the analysis will center on its stock price movement probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, the downgrade and concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has also seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. Therefore, the downgrade and negative outlook are likely to increase the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Instead, it discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Since the news does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a direct impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. However, given Apple's strong market position, robust product offerings, and loyal consumer base, it's likely that the overall market sentiment might still remain positive towards Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
