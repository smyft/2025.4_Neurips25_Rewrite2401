      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\nNews Content: How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple could signal a loss of confidence among significant investors, especially given his history of successful trades. Coupled with declining iPhone sales in China and potential revenue losses from a court ruling regarding default search placements with Google, there are significant concerns about Apple's future profitability. Meanwhile, the stock's high valuation relative to earnings and analysts' views on a lack of upgrade cycles add further downward pressure. Thus, these factors contribute to a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These factors significantly outweigh Cohen's action, as his trade occurred in a previous quarter. The article concludes with a strong negative sentiment towards Apple stock. Conversely, the news presents a more bullish outlook for Axon Enterprise, highlighting its strong financial performance, market leadership, and significant growth potential in a large addressable market. While its valuation is high, its consistent earnings beat history is mentioned as a positive.  However, the focus is primarily on Apple, so the analysis will center on its stock price movement probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, the downgrade and concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has also seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. Therefore, the downgrade and negative outlook are likely to increase the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Instead, it discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Since the news does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a direct impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. However, given Apple's strong market position, robust product offerings, and loyal consumer base, it's likely that the overall market sentiment might still remain positive towards Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's stock price.
