(AAPL)\nNews Headline: From FANG to BATMMAAN, the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms\nNews Content: Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre outlines how the market's favorite group of megacap stocks has evolved from FAANG \u2014 made up of Meta Platforms (META) (formerly Facebook), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) (formerly Google) \u2014 to the Magnificent Seven and now the emerging BATMMAAN group, now consisting of Broadcom (AVGO), Apple, Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nBlikre goes on to compare the returns seen from each iteration of tech company groupings.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple could signal a loss of confidence among significant investors, especially given his history of successful trades. Coupled with declining iPhone sales in China and potential revenue losses from a court ruling regarding default search placements with Google, there are significant concerns about Apple's future profitability. Meanwhile, the stock's high valuation relative to earnings and analysts' views on a lack of upgrade cycles add further downward pressure. Thus, these factors contribute to a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These factors significantly outweigh Cohen's action, as his trade occurred in a previous quarter. The article concludes with a strong negative sentiment towards Apple stock. Conversely, the news presents a more bullish outlook for Axon Enterprise, highlighting its strong financial performance, market leadership, and significant growth potential in a large addressable market. While its valuation is high, its consistent earnings beat history is mentioned as a positive.  However, the focus is primarily on Apple, so the analysis will center on its stock price movement probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, the downgrade and concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has also seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. Therefore, the downgrade and negative outlook are likely to increase the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Instead, it discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Since the news does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a direct impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. However, given Apple's strong market position, robust product offerings, and loyal consumer base, it's likely that the overall market sentiment might still remain positive towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news about Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple raises concerns about the company's prospects, particularly given the declining sales in China, the potential legal issues affecting services revenue, and the failure of an anticipated upgrade cycle. These factors collectively suggest a bearish outlook for Apple. The mix of poor sales performance and high valuation metrics further supports the case for a declining stock price. While Apple remains a strong and established brand, the current circumstances heavily weigh toward a selling pressure, leading to a higher probability of falling stock prices compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline directly states that Apple has received a rare Underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is inherently negative. While the analysis should consider Apple's overall financial health (which is generally strong), the immediate impact of an analyst downgrade usually leads to selling pressure. Considering the trend in previous rounds, the initial negative sentiment is strong with the stock price predicted to fall. While some rounds predicted a higher chance of the stock rising (0.5 and 0.55), most predicted the stock falling (~0.7). Given that others also considered sale of stakes previously, a new underperform rating further contributes to the sentiment that the stock price will likely fall. I would lean towards a pessimistic outcome. Analyst ratings have a strong influence on retail traders.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to note this transaction occurred in Q3, and the current market sentiment might differ.  The article highlights several concerning factors: declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue loss from the Google lawsuit concerning Safari's default search, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle to boost sales. These factors strongly suggest a bearish outlook.  The high P/E ratio of 33 further exacerbates the concerns about overvaluation.  While the article mentions 9% earnings growth predicted for the next year, this is insufficient to justify the current valuation in light of the other negative factors. The previous predictions range widely, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement. Considering all presented information, I lean towards a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. However, Apple's services revenue growth and high-margin business could mitigate some of the negative impacts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news provided does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. It discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's stock price. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a general trend of negative sentiment towards Apple due to various factors such as declining iPhone sales, potential revenue losses, and high valuation. Yet, since the provided news does not directly relate to these factors, its impact should be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are estimated to be neutral, with a slight inclination towards a rise based on the general market performance and the nature of the news not being directly negative towards Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. Additionally, previous predictions show a general trend of pessimism, with multiple estimations suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Although Apple continues to have a strong market position and a loyal customer base, the increasing concerns regarding the competitive landscape and regulatory scrutiny may contribute to investor unease.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news of Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple and investing in a small AI stock raises concerns about investor confidence in Apple. This sentiment is compounded by the challenges Apple faces, such as declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue losses from a legal ruling involving Google, and the lack of anticipated sales growth from AI features. Additionally, analysts express concerns over Apple's current high valuation metrics in relation to expected earnings growth. Based on this overwhelming negative sentiment and the high likelihood of selling pressure, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is estimated to be significantly higher than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline announces a rare underperform rating for Apple by a Wall Street analyst. This is a significant negative indicator, as it signals a change in sentiment from at least one professional investment firm. While Apple is a large and well-established company, analyst ratings can strongly influence investor behavior, particularly in the short term. The previous rounds also demonstrate a trend of negative sentiment toward Apple, citing concerns about declining sales, potential revenue losses, and valuation. Most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, in line with the negative sentiment and the analyst downgrade, as well as the previous predictions and their reasoning, I will put more weight on the negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple.  While the Cohen trade is a lagging indicator, the other factors are more concerning: declining iPhone sales in China (a major market), potential significant revenue loss from the Google lawsuit, and the failure of the AI-driven upgrade cycle to boost sales are all substantial headwinds.  The high P/E ratio of 33 suggests overvaluation. Although the article mentions projected 9% earnings growth, this is insufficient to offset the significant negative factors.  The previous predictions from multiple models show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price decline, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 in many cases. While some predictions lean towards neutrality, the weight of the negative news and the consensus from other predictive models strongly suggests a bearish outlook.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc.

The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news. Previous predictions show a mix of sentiment, but the neutral nature of this news suggests a balanced probability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features.

Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. Considering the trend in previous rounds, where most models predicted a higher chance of the stock falling (~0.7), and the current negative sentiment, it is reasonable to lean towards a pessimistic outcome.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc.

However, analyzing the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a general trend of negative sentiment towards Apple due to various factors such as declining iPhone sales, potential revenue losses, and high valuation. Given the indirect nature of the news and the overall market context, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are estimated to be neutral, with a slight inclination towards a fall based on the prevailing negative sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims.
