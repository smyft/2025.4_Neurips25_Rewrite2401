      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple could signal a loss of confidence among significant investors, especially given his history of successful trades. Coupled with declining iPhone sales in China and potential revenue losses from a court ruling regarding default search placements with Google, there are significant concerns about Apple's future profitability. Meanwhile, the stock's high valuation relative to earnings and analysts' views on a lack of upgrade cycles add further downward pressure. Thus, these factors contribute to a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These factors significantly outweigh Cohen's action, as his trade occurred in a previous quarter. The article concludes with a strong negative sentiment towards Apple stock. Conversely, the news presents a more bullish outlook for Axon Enterprise, highlighting its strong financial performance, market leadership, and significant growth potential in a large addressable market. While its valuation is high, its consistent earnings beat history is mentioned as a positive.  However, the focus is primarily on Apple, so the analysis will center on its stock price movement probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, the downgrade and concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has also seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. Therefore, the downgrade and negative outlook are likely to increase the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Instead, it discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Since the news does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a direct impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. However, given Apple's strong market position, robust product offerings, and loyal consumer base, it's likely that the overall market sentiment might still remain positive towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news about Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple raises concerns about the company's prospects, particularly given the declining sales in China, the potential legal issues affecting services revenue, and the failure of an anticipated upgrade cycle. These factors collectively suggest a bearish outlook for Apple. The mix of poor sales performance and high valuation metrics further supports the case for a declining stock price. While Apple remains a strong and established brand, the current circumstances heavily weigh toward a selling pressure, leading to a higher probability of falling stock prices compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline directly states that Apple has received a rare Underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is inherently negative. While the analysis should consider Apple's overall financial health (which is generally strong), the immediate impact of an analyst downgrade usually leads to selling pressure. Considering the trend in previous rounds, the initial negative sentiment is strong with the stock price predicted to fall. While some rounds predicted a higher chance of the stock rising (0.5 and 0.55), most predicted the stock falling (~0.7). Given that others also considered sale of stakes previously, a new underperform rating further contributes to the sentiment that the stock price will likely fall. I would lean towards a pessimistic outcome. Analyst ratings have a strong influence on retail traders.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to note this transaction occurred in Q3, and the current market sentiment might differ.  The article highlights several concerning factors: declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue loss from the Google lawsuit concerning Safari's default search, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle to boost sales. These factors strongly suggest a bearish outlook.  The high P/E ratio of 33 further exacerbates the concerns about overvaluation.  While the article mentions 9% earnings growth predicted for the next year, this is insufficient to justify the current valuation in light of the other negative factors. The previous predictions range widely, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement. Considering all presented information, I lean towards a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. However, Apple's services revenue growth and high-margin business could mitigate some of the negative impacts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news provided does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. It discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's stock price. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a general trend of negative sentiment towards Apple due to various factors such as declining iPhone sales, potential revenue losses, and high valuation. Yet, since the provided news does not directly relate to these factors, its impact should be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are estimated to be neutral, with a slight inclination towards a rise based on the general market performance and the nature of the news not being directly negative towards Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. Additionally, previous predictions show a general trend of pessimism, with multiple estimations suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Although Apple continues to have a strong market position and a loyal customer base, the increasing concerns regarding the competitive landscape and regulatory scrutiny may contribute to investor unease.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news of Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple and investing in a small AI stock raises concerns about investor confidence in Apple. This sentiment is compounded by the challenges Apple faces, such as declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue losses from a legal ruling involving Google, and the lack of anticipated sales growth from AI features. Additionally, analysts express concerns over Apple's current high valuation metrics in relation to expected earnings growth. Based on this overwhelming negative sentiment and the high likelihood of selling pressure, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is estimated to be significantly higher than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline announces a rare underperform rating for Apple by a Wall Street analyst. This is a significant negative indicator, as it signals a change in sentiment from at least one professional investment firm. While Apple is a large and well-established company, analyst ratings can strongly influence investor behavior, particularly in the short term. The previous rounds also demonstrate a trend of negative sentiment toward Apple, citing concerns about declining sales, potential revenue losses, and valuation. Most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, in line with the negative sentiment and the analyst downgrade, as well as the previous predictions and their reasoning, I will put more weight on the negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple.  While the Cohen trade is a lagging indicator, the other factors are more concerning: declining iPhone sales in China (a major market), potential significant revenue loss from the Google lawsuit, and the failure of the AI-driven upgrade cycle to boost sales are all substantial headwinds.  The high P/E ratio of 33 suggests overvaluation. Although the article mentions projected 9% earnings growth, this is insufficient to offset the significant negative factors.  The previous predictions from multiple models show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price decline, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 in many cases. While some predictions lean towards neutrality, the weight of the negative news and the consensus from other predictive models strongly suggests a bearish outlook.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc.

Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news. Previous predictions show a mix of sentiment, but the neutral nature of this news suggests a balanced probability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features.

Given the indirect nature of the news and the overall market context, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are estimated to be neutral, with a slight inclination towards a fall based on the prevailing negative sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims.
