(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones\nNews Content: BT van\n\nBT has called for a competition crackdown on Apple over concerns the tech giant could use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks.\n\nThe operator has raised concerns that the rise of virtual \u201ceSims\u201d that replace Sim cards could see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.\n\nIn a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: \u201cWe also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d\n\nPhysical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and its rivals risk losing ground to the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.\n\nThe threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.\n\nBT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.\n\nHowever, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.\n\nKester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: \u201cOne of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there\u2019s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that\u2019s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.\u201d\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks \u2013 similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile \u2013 though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.\n\neSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.\n\nApple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.\n\nBT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: \u201cIncreased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.\u201d\n\nVodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.\n\nApple did not comment on the BT submission.\n\nIn response to last week\u2019s CMA investigation it said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple could signal a loss of confidence among significant investors, especially given his history of successful trades. Coupled with declining iPhone sales in China and potential revenue losses from a court ruling regarding default search placements with Google, there are significant concerns about Apple's future profitability. Meanwhile, the stock's high valuation relative to earnings and analysts' views on a lack of upgrade cycles add further downward pressure. Thus, these factors contribute to a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment towards a stock. While Apple is a strong company with a solid track record, analyst ratings, especially negative ones, can influence investor behavior and lead to selling pressure. However, the overall impact depends on the specific analyst's reputation, the reasoning behind the rating, and the broader market context. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, this single negative rating is unlikely to cause a major crash, but it will likely create some downward pressure. If, after initial reaction, investors believe the analyst's argument is weak, or if broader market sentiment is positive, the stock may recover. This is a single data point and the analyst ratings do not always determine where the stock will go.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These factors significantly outweigh Cohen's action, as his trade occurred in a previous quarter. The article concludes with a strong negative sentiment towards Apple stock. Conversely, the news presents a more bullish outlook for Axon Enterprise, highlighting its strong financial performance, market leadership, and significant growth potential in a large addressable market. While its valuation is high, its consistent earnings beat history is mentioned as a positive.  However, the focus is primarily on Apple, so the analysis will center on its stock price movement probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, the downgrade and concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has also seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. Therefore, the downgrade and negative outlook are likely to increase the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Instead, it discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Since the news does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a direct impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. However, given Apple's strong market position, robust product offerings, and loyal consumer base, it's likely that the overall market sentiment might still remain positive towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news about Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple raises concerns about the company's prospects, particularly given the declining sales in China, the potential legal issues affecting services revenue, and the failure of an anticipated upgrade cycle. These factors collectively suggest a bearish outlook for Apple. The mix of poor sales performance and high valuation metrics further supports the case for a declining stock price. While Apple remains a strong and established brand, the current circumstances heavily weigh toward a selling pressure, leading to a higher probability of falling stock prices compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline directly states that Apple has received a rare Underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is inherently negative. While the analysis should consider Apple's overall financial health (which is generally strong), the immediate impact of an analyst downgrade usually leads to selling pressure. Considering the trend in previous rounds, the initial negative sentiment is strong with the stock price predicted to fall. While some rounds predicted a higher chance of the stock rising (0.5 and 0.55), most predicted the stock falling (~0.7). Given that others also considered sale of stakes previously, a new underperform rating further contributes to the sentiment that the stock price will likely fall. I would lean towards a pessimistic outcome. Analyst ratings have a strong influence on retail traders.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to note this transaction occurred in Q3, and the current market sentiment might differ.  The article highlights several concerning factors: declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue loss from the Google lawsuit concerning Safari's default search, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle to boost sales. These factors strongly suggest a bearish outlook.  The high P/E ratio of 33 further exacerbates the concerns about overvaluation.  While the article mentions 9% earnings growth predicted for the next year, this is insufficient to justify the current valuation in light of the other negative factors. The previous predictions range widely, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement. Considering all presented information, I lean towards a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. However, Apple's services revenue growth and high-margin business could mitigate some of the negative impacts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news provided does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. It discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's stock price. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a general trend of negative sentiment towards Apple due to various factors such as declining iPhone sales, potential revenue losses, and high valuation. Yet, since the provided news does not directly relate to these factors, its impact should be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are estimated to be neutral, with a slight inclination towards a rise based on the general market performance and the nature of the news not being directly negative towards Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. Additionally, previous predictions show a general trend of pessimism, with multiple estimations suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Although Apple continues to have a strong market position and a loyal customer base, the increasing concerns regarding the competitive landscape and regulatory scrutiny may contribute to investor unease.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news of Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple and investing in a small AI stock raises concerns about investor confidence in Apple. This sentiment is compounded by the challenges Apple faces, such as declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue losses from a legal ruling involving Google, and the lack of anticipated sales growth from AI features. Additionally, analysts express concerns over Apple's current high valuation metrics in relation to expected earnings growth. Based on this overwhelming negative sentiment and the high likelihood of selling pressure, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is estimated to be significantly higher than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline announces a rare underperform rating for Apple by a Wall Street analyst. This is a significant negative indicator, as it signals a change in sentiment from at least one professional investment firm. While Apple is a large and well-established company, analyst ratings can strongly influence investor behavior, particularly in the short term. The previous rounds also demonstrate a trend of negative sentiment toward Apple, citing concerns about declining sales, potential revenue losses, and valuation. Most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, in line with the negative sentiment and the analyst downgrade, as well as the previous predictions and their reasoning, I will put more weight on the negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple.  While the Cohen trade is a lagging indicator, the other factors are more concerning: declining iPhone sales in China (a major market), potential significant revenue loss from the Google lawsuit, and the failure of the AI-driven upgrade cycle to boost sales are all substantial headwinds.  The high P/E ratio of 33 suggests overvaluation. Although the article mentions projected 9% earnings growth, this is insufficient to offset the significant negative factors.  The previous predictions from multiple models show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price decline, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 in many cases. While some predictions lean towards neutrality, the weight of the negative news and the consensus from other predictive models strongly suggests a bearish outlook.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of these evolving acronyms (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN) is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. The probabilities are based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news. Previous predictions show a mix of sentiment, but the neutral nature of this news suggests a balanced probability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue, concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption are likely to negatively impact the stock price. The stock has seen significant multiple expansion, which may not be sustainable if growth expectations diminish. Considering the trend in previous rounds, where most models predicted a higher chance of the stock falling (~0.7), and the current negative sentiment, it is reasonable to lean towards a pessimistic outcome.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Considering the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's stock price. However, analyzing the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a general trend of negative sentiment towards Apple due to various factors such as declining iPhone sales, potential revenue losses, and high valuation. Given the indirect nature of the news and the overall market context, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are estimated to be neutral, with a slight inclination towards a fall based on the prevailing negative sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. Additionally, previous predictions show a general trend of pessimism, with multiple estimations suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Although Apple continues to have a strong market position and a loyal customer base, the increasing concerns regarding the competitive landscape and regulatory scrutiny may contribute to investor unease.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news about Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple raises significant concerns regarding investor confidence. With declining iPhone sales in China, potential revenue losses from a legal challenge involving Google, and the failure of anticipated growth from AI features, several factors collectively indicate a bearish outlook for Apple's stock. Moreover, the recent underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst adds further downward pressure, suggesting that negative sentiment among investors is likely to persist. This overwhelming negative context leads to higher probabilities for a decline in stock price compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline directly reports a rare \"Underperform\" rating for Apple from a Wall Street analyst. This is inherently negative and signals a potential downturn. The previous rounds of predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, citing concerns about declining iPhone sales, potential revenue losses due to legal issues, and high valuation. While the models also recognize Apple's strengths, the immediate impact of a negative analyst rating, compounded by these existing concerns, will likely trigger selling pressure. Some models incorrectly refer to older separate news events related to Apple. I will focus on the provided headline and the consensus from the previous rounds that the stock price will likely fall because of this negative analyst rating, which serves as the key factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While Steven Cohen selling his stake is a bearish signal, it's a lagging indicator from Q3.  More concerning are the declining iPhone sales in China, potential substantial revenue loss from the Google lawsuit, and the failed AI-driven upgrade cycle. These factors strongly suggest a bearish outlook for Apple. The high P/E ratio of 33 further indicates overvaluation. Projected 9% earnings growth is insufficient to offset these negative factors.  The consensus among previous predictions heavily favors a price decline, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 probability in multiple models. Although some models remain neutral, the weight of negative news, combined with the consistent bearish sentiment from other predictive models, points towards a higher likelihood of a stock price fall.  The consistent negative predictions across different models increase confidence in the bearish outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc.
