(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decision by Steven Cohen, a well-known hedge fund manager, who sold his entire stake in Apple, indicating a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects. Coupled with declining iPhone market share in China, potential losses from a legal decision regarding Apple's search agreements, and concerns about the lack of an iPhone upgrade cycle, the sentiment around Apple appears negative. This could lead to downward pressure on the stock price. While there is an expected earnings increase of 9% over the next year, the current high valuation (33 times earnings) makes the stock less attractive. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is incorporating AI (Apple Intelligence) into its products and has strong ecosystem durability, the revenue growth is slowing. Goldman Sachs lowered the price target, citing lower iPhone sales, even though they maintain a \"Buy\" rating. The article suggests optimism for future iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence rollout but not until fiscal 2026. Competition in China is cited as a present concern, with potential sentiment improvement midyear based on future developments. The article also emphasizes 'superior' AI stocks than AAPL that can deliver a shorter time frame with significant returns, implying that in the short term AAPL isn't the best choice for an investor. Furthermore, the article implies that some hedge funds are buying 'other' trending AI stocks, suggesting potentially increased investment in 'other' AI companies than AAPL. Due to the mixed signals, slightly more weight is given to the negative elements (slower growth, price target downgrade, competition) than the long-term potential, indicating a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall in the short-term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts), several economists predict a potential bear market, some forecasting a significant drop (up to 40%).  The article highlights concerns about inflation, interest rates, and the impact of AI adoption on the tech sector. Conversely, other experts remain optimistic about overall economic growth. Apple's inclusion in a 'best bear market stocks' list suggests it's considered relatively resilient, but its ranking as only 3rd implies the authors believe other stocks offer better potential. The surge in foreign investment in US stocks is noted as a potentially bearish indicator.  Given the conflicting views and uncertainty about the market's direction, a neutral to slightly bearish outlook is most appropriate.  The strong financial performance of Apple itself argues for a higher probability of price stability or even slight increase, however, given the broader context, this is moderated.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news mentions that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI stock that has seen significant gains. This could be perceived negatively by the market, as it suggests a loss of confidence by a high-profile investor in Apple. However, Apple is a large, well-established company with a diverse product line and strong financials, so the impact may be limited. The selling by Cohen might trigger some short-term negative sentiment, but it is unlikely to cause a significant long-term decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's potential dividend income from five stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article mentions that Buffett has reduced his position in Apple, it still remains Berkshire's largest holding and a source of dividend income. The article highlights Apple's dividend of $1 per share, which translates to $300 million in dividend income for Berkshire in 2025. However, there is no direct indication that this news will significantly impact Apple's stock price. The article is more focused on Buffett's dividend income rather than Apple's future performance or prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news states that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a different AI company, which could be perceived as a loss of confidence in Apple's potential growth. However, it's essential to consider that individual investor decisions, even those of prominent figures like Steven Cohen, do not solely dictate market trends. Apple's stock price is influenced by a multitude of factors including its financial performance, product releases, and overall market conditions. Given that Cohen's actions are more likely to reflect his personal investment strategy rather than a definitive indicator of Apple's future performance, the impact on Apple's stock price may be minimal or short-term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms in the tech sector rather than on specific performance indicators or events for Apple Inc. While being included in the 'BATMMAAN' grouping may highlight Apple's continued significance in the market, it doesn't directly correlate to positive or negative stock price movement. It's mostly a commentary on the broader tech sector and market trends. Therefore, there isn't a clear positive or negative signal that can be inferred directly from this news for Apple Inc.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
