However, it's essential to consider that individual investor decisions, even those of prominent figures like Steven Cohen, do not solely dictate market trends. Apple's stock price is influenced by a multitude of factors including its financial performance, product releases, and overall market conditions. Given that Cohen's actions are more likely to reflect his personal investment strategy rather than a definitive indicator of Apple's future performance, the impact on Apple's stock price may be minimal or short-term.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}"
