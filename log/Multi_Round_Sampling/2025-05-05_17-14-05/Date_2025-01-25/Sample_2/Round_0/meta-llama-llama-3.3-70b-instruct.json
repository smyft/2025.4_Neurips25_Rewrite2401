This could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, resulting in a fall in the stock price. However, it's also possible that the market may not heavily react to a single analyst's rating, especially considering Apple's strong brand and historical performance. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of falling, but still possible due to the overall market sentiment and other positive factors that might influence the stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst.
