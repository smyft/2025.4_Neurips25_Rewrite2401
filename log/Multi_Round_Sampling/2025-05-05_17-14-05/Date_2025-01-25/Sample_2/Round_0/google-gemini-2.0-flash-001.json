A single investor's actions, even a billionaire's, often have a negligible impact, unless the sale is substantial and signals a broader concern. The headline focuses more on the purchase of an AI stock, implying shifting investment strategy but not necessarily a negative outlook on Apple. However, the headline CAN create some negative sentiment nonetheless. Since Apple is a very large company, the impact will be minimal. I will assume a slight but not significant negativity. Therefore lower probability of rise and a slightly more probable fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
