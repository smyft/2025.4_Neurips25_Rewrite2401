(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones\nNews Content: BT van\n\nBT has called for a competition crackdown on Apple over concerns the tech giant could use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks.\n\nThe operator has raised concerns that the rise of virtual \u201ceSims\u201d that replace Sim cards could see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.\n\nIn a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: \u201cWe also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d\n\nPhysical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and its rivals risk losing ground to the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.\n\nThe threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.\n\nBT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.\n\nHowever, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.\n\nKester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: \u201cOne of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there\u2019s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that\u2019s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.\u201d\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks \u2013 similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile \u2013 though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.\n\neSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.\n\nApple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.\n\nBT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: \u201cIncreased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.\u201d\n\nVodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.\n\nApple did not comment on the BT submission.\n\nIn response to last week\u2019s CMA investigation it said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's slower revenue growth and a downgrade in price target by Goldman Sachs, driven by concerns over iPhone sales amidst increasing competition in the Chinese market. However, it also mentions optimism regarding Apple's AI initiatives and potential growth due to new product launches in the future. This mix of cautious outlook with potential bright spots leads to a balanced probability assessment, leaning slightly more towards a rise due to long-term growth potential.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: While the news mentions a prominent investor (Steven Cohen) selling Apple stock, it's important to consider the scale of his portfolio relative to Apple's massive market capitalization and daily trading volume. A single investor's actions, even a billionaire's, often have a negligible impact, unless the sale is substantial and signals a broader concern. The headline focuses more on the purchase of an AI stock, implying shifting investment strategy but not necessarily a negative outlook on Apple. However, the headline CAN create some negative sentiment nonetheless. Since Apple is a very large company, the impact will be minimal. I will assume a slight but not significant negativity. Therefore lower probability of rise and a slightly more probable fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, where AI will be a key focus.  Positive AI-related announcements could boost the stock price, while negative news or underwhelming results could lead to a decline. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is also a significant factor. A rate hike could negatively impact the overall market and Apple's stock price due to increased borrowing costs and potentially reduced consumer spending. Conversely, a less aggressive or dovish stance could be positive for the market and Apple.  However, the news itself provides no specific information about Apple's expected performance, making it difficult to definitively predict the stock's movement.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned assuming a neutral market reaction in the absence of specific details.  The probabilities are not heavily skewed towards either direction, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators about Apple's potential to leverage its market position with eSim technology, which could disrupt traditional mobile networks. While this could pose regulatory and competitive challenges for Apple, the company's strong market position and innovation capabilities are likely to mitigate negative impacts. Additionally, Apple's response indicates a commitment to constructive engagement with regulatory bodies, which may alleviate some investor concerns. Overall, the news is somewhat negative but not significantly detrimental to Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for a bear market in 2025, citing various economic experts and their predictions. Despite concerns about a possible downturn, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is highlighted as a prime investment opportunity due to its robust financial health, consistent record of returning value to shareholders, and expanding AI features. The company's strong performance, with a total revenue of $94.9 billion and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $0.97, indicates its resilience. Additionally, Apple's introduction of new health-monitoring tools and its consistent dividend payments contribute to its appeal as a stable investment. However, the overall market sentiment and predictions of a potential bear market or economic downturn could impact Apple's stock price. Given the cautious optimism and concerns about potential market peaks, there is a balanced view on the stock's performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of Apple receiving a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst could potentially signal a negative outlook on the company's future performance. This could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, resulting in a fall in the stock price. However, it's also possible that the market may not heavily react to a single analyst's rating, especially considering Apple's strong brand and historical performance. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of falling, but still possible due to the overall market sentiment and other positive factors that might influence the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, coupled with concerns over weak iPhone shipments, lack of AI feature resonance, and potential disappointments in revenue projections. Despite these negatives, Apple retains a strong business model with robust service revenue and solid margins. However, the negative sentiment from an analyst downgrade and specific concerns about future growth prospects suggest a bearish impact on investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
