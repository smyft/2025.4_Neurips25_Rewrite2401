(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?\nNews Content: In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It Time to Sell the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's slower revenue growth and a downgrade in price target by Goldman Sachs, driven by concerns over iPhone sales amidst increasing competition in the Chinese market. However, it also mentions optimism regarding Apple's AI initiatives and potential growth due to new product launches in the future. This mix of cautious outlook with potential bright spots leads to a balanced probability assessment, leaning slightly more towards a rise due to long-term growth potential.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: While the news mentions a prominent investor (Steven Cohen) selling Apple stock, it's important to consider the scale of his portfolio relative to Apple's massive market capitalization and daily trading volume. A single investor's actions, even a billionaire's, often have a negligible impact, unless the sale is substantial and signals a broader concern. The headline focuses more on the purchase of an AI stock, implying shifting investment strategy but not necessarily a negative outlook on Apple. However, the headline CAN create some negative sentiment nonetheless. Since Apple is a very large company, the impact will be minimal. I will assume a slight but not significant negativity. Therefore lower probability of rise and a slightly more probable fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, where AI will be a key focus.  Positive AI-related announcements could boost the stock price, while negative news or underwhelming results could lead to a decline. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is also a significant factor. A rate hike could negatively impact the overall market and Apple's stock price due to increased borrowing costs and potentially reduced consumer spending. Conversely, a less aggressive or dovish stance could be positive for the market and Apple.  However, the news itself provides no specific information about Apple's expected performance, making it difficult to definitively predict the stock's movement.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned assuming a neutral market reaction in the absence of specific details.  The probabilities are not heavily skewed towards either direction, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators about Apple's potential to leverage its market position with eSim technology, which could disrupt traditional mobile networks. While this could pose regulatory and competitive challenges for Apple, the company's strong market position and innovation capabilities are likely to mitigate negative impacts. Additionally, Apple's response indicates a commitment to constructive engagement with regulatory bodies, which may alleviate some investor concerns. Overall, the news is somewhat negative but not significantly detrimental to Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for a bear market in 2025, citing various economic experts and their predictions. Despite concerns about a possible downturn, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is highlighted as a prime investment opportunity due to its robust financial health, consistent record of returning value to shareholders, and expanding AI features. The company's strong performance, with a total revenue of $94.9 billion and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $0.97, indicates its resilience. Additionally, Apple's introduction of new health-monitoring tools and its consistent dividend payments contribute to its appeal as a stable investment. However, the overall market sentiment and predictions of a potential bear market or economic downturn could impact Apple's stock price. Given the cautious optimism and concerns about potential market peaks, there is a balanced view on the stock's performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of Apple receiving a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst could potentially signal a negative outlook on the company's future performance. This could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, resulting in a fall in the stock price. However, it's also possible that the market may not heavily react to a single analyst's rating, especially considering Apple's strong brand and historical performance. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of falling, but still possible due to the overall market sentiment and other positive factors that might influence the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, coupled with concerns over weak iPhone shipments, lack of AI feature resonance, and potential disappointments in revenue projections. Despite these negatives, Apple retains a strong business model with robust service revenue and solid margins. However, the negative sentiment from an analyst downgrade and specific concerns about future growth prospects suggest a bearish impact on investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
