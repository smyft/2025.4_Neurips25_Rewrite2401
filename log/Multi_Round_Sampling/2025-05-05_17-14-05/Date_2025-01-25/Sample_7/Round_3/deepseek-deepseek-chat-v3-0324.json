(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?\nNews Content: In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It Time to Sell the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple's current share price of $223 is perceived as undervalued, with an estimated fair value of $279, suggesting a 20% upside potential. Analyst price targets averaging around $246 also support a bullish outlook despite a noted decline in earnings over the past year. Given the positive valuation sentiment and the forecast for annual earnings growth in the next three years, there exists a stronger probability for the stock to rise. However, the warning signs regarding management and slower earnings growth compared to the American market introduce some risk factors that could lead to a downward movement. Overall, the bullish sentiment derived from the undervaluation and positive forecast outweighs the negatives.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of AI features to drive an expected upgrade cycle.  These factors, along with Apple's high P/E ratio, suggest a considerable risk of a price drop. However, Apple remains a dominant player in the tech industry with a loyal customer base and considerable revenue from its services segment.  The 9% earnings growth expectation for the next year offers some counterbalance to the negative factors.  Therefore, while the probabilities favor a price fall based on the current news and analysis, the possibility of a rise cannot be completely dismissed due to Apple's overall market position.  The uncertainty surrounding the future impact of the mentioned headwinds makes a precise prediction difficult.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple due to weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience. Given the downgrade and the concerns raised, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term, but the long-term impact may be mitigated by Apple's diversified revenue streams.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. Such a downgrade can lead to a decrease in investor confidence and potentially cause the stock price to fall. Given that the rating is rare, it may draw significant attention and have a pronounced effect on the stock's short-term performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings season, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of the major companies reporting its results. The article mentions that Apple's shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also provides a positive outlook for the overall earnings picture, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that Apple Inc. has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which suggests a pessimistic outlook on the stock's future performance. Generally, such ratings can lead to a decline in investor confidence, resulting in potential selling pressure on the stock. While it's important to consider various factors like company fundamentals, market conditions, and broader economic trends, the news item itself points towards a negative sentiment, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's estimated fair value suggests that the current share price of $223 indicates a 20% undervaluation compared to the intrinsic value of $279. This offers a positive outlook for potential price appreciation. Additionally, there is a forecast for growth in annual earnings over the next three years, which typically would support a bullish sentiment. However, there are concerns related to recent earnings decline, a low dividend compared to peers, and risks associated with a rare underperform rating from analysts. Taking into account the overall mixed sentiment in recent predictions, where some show caution due to underlying challenges but also recognize Apple's market position, I estimate a slightly positive bias for the stock price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall bearish outlook for Apple. A rare 'Underperform' rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster AI feature adoption, is significant. Concerns about China sales and the potential loss of Google search revenue add to the negative sentiment. While Apple's strong service revenue and high margins provide some support, the article explicitly recommends taking profits on the stock due to multiple expansion and diminishing upgrade cycle prospects. Previous predictions also lean bearish, with the majority assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. Given these factors, I believe the probability of the stock falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  While Apple remains a dominant player, several significant headwinds are highlighted: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of significant service revenue, and the failure of AI features to boost sales as anticipated.  These factors, coupled with a high P/E ratio and Cohen's sale of his stake (a key indicator), strongly suggest a negative market reaction. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. While some models point to a potential rise due to undervaluation or future growth prospects, the immediate impact of the negative news is more likely to outweigh these long-term considerations. The consensus earnings growth prediction of 9% is modest considering the current valuation and doesn't fully offset the immediate negative factors.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle. Additionally, challenges in China, including a significant drop in iPhone sales and the inability to offer AI features there, along with potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case, add to the negative outlook. While Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience, the downgrade and the concerns raised are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70% or higher chance of a decline. Given the combination of the rare underperform rating, weak iPhone sales, and geopolitical challenges, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. However, considering Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model, there is some resilience that could mitigate the negative impact. The mixed outlook and various headwinds, including weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Yet, the possibility of a rise cannot be completely dismissed due to Apple's dominant position in the tech industry and its loyal customer base.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q4 earnings report, highlighting concerns about China and AI strategy. Despite these worries, some analysts believe the issues are manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. The overall earnings picture looks positive, with double-digit growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with a cautious outlook due to the mixed sentiment presented in the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that Apple Inc. has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which has been a common theme among multiple predictions. Several models have indicated a higher likelihood of stock price falling due to this negative development. Despite some optimistic forecasts suggesting slight upward potentials, the recent trend shows increased concern over Apple's performance, notably in key markets like China and in critical areas like AI. Given the consistency across models for a bearish outlook, combined with the rarity of the underperform rating, it is reasonable to predict a greater probability of stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple's estimated fair value at $279, indicating a 20% undervaluation compared to the current share price of $223. This supports a bullish outlook for the stock, suggesting potential upside. However, there are concerns regarding declining earnings, a low dividend compared to peers, and a rare 'Underperform' rating from analysts citing challenges in key markets and product cycles. While the positive valuation and earnings growth projections provide some support for price appreciation, the negative sentiment surrounding performance metrics introduces considerable risk factors. Overall, the estimates lean towards a higher probability of a price fall due to recent analyst sentiments and market concerns, balanced against the inherent undervaluation and growth potential of Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on a rare 'Underperform' rating for Apple due to concerns about iPhone sales, AI adoption, and challenges in China. These are significant negative catalysts. While Apple's services revenue is a strength, the market tends to react strongly to downgrades and concerns about future product cycles, especially when AI is a key growth narrative. The previous round of predictions largely leaned bearish, acknowledging these headwinds. Taking these factors into consideration and seeing that Apple has been struggling in China, it is more probable that the article could negatively affect the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple.  The sale of Apple stock by a prominent investor like Steven Cohen is a significant bearish signal.  Furthermore, the article details several substantial headwinds: declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue loss from the Google search dispute, and the disappointing lack of an AI-driven upgrade cycle. These factors, coupled with Apple's high P/E ratio, heavily outweigh the positive aspects, such as its strong services business and projected 9% earnings growth (which is modest relative to the valuation).  The consensus among previous predictions leans heavily towards a price drop, further reinforcing this assessment. While Apple's market dominance and loyal customer base provide some resilience, the immediate impact of the negative news is likely to outweigh these long-term positives. The probability of a price fall is therefore considered significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle.

Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70% or higher chance of a decline. Given the combination of the rare underperform rating, weak iPhone sales, and geopolitical challenges, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock.

The overall earnings picture looks positive, with double-digit growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering the mixed sentiment presented in the article and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the concerns about China and AI strategy introduce some uncertainty, making the probability of a fall not negligible. The probabilities are estimated based on the analysis of the news content, the company's current situation, and the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc., which is a notable negative signal. Previous predictions have shown a range of sentiments, with most indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling. Apple faces significant headwinds such as declining iPhone sales in China and concerns over its AI strategy, all contributing to a bearish outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience. The combination of rare underperform ratings and market concerns, alongside the negative sentiments expressed in prior rounds, leads to a cautious prediction leaning towards a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
