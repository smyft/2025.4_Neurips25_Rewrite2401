      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple's current share price of $223 is perceived as undervalued, with an estimated fair value of $279, suggesting a 20% upside potential. Analyst price targets averaging around $246 also support a bullish outlook despite a noted decline in earnings over the past year. Given the positive valuation sentiment and the forecast for annual earnings growth in the next three years, there exists a stronger probability for the stock to rise. However, the warning signs regarding management and slower earnings growth compared to the American market introduce some risk factors that could lead to a downward movement. Overall, the bullish sentiment derived from the undervaluation and positive forecast outweighs the negatives.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of AI features to drive an expected upgrade cycle.  These factors, along with Apple's high P/E ratio, suggest a considerable risk of a price drop. However, Apple remains a dominant player in the tech industry with a loyal customer base and considerable revenue from its services segment.  The 9% earnings growth expectation for the next year offers some counterbalance to the negative factors.  Therefore, while the probabilities favor a price fall based on the current news and analysis, the possibility of a rise cannot be completely dismissed due to Apple's overall market position.  The uncertainty surrounding the future impact of the mentioned headwinds makes a precise prediction difficult.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple due to weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience. Given the downgrade and the concerns raised, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term, but the long-term impact may be mitigated by Apple's diversified revenue streams.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. Such a downgrade can lead to a decrease in investor confidence and potentially cause the stock price to fall. Given that the rating is rare, it may draw significant attention and have a pronounced effect on the stock's short-term performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings season, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of the major companies reporting its results. The article mentions that Apple's shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also provides a positive outlook for the overall earnings picture, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that Apple Inc. has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which suggests a pessimistic outlook on the stock's future performance. Generally, such ratings can lead to a decline in investor confidence, resulting in potential selling pressure on the stock. While it's important to consider various factors like company fundamentals, market conditions, and broader economic trends, the news item itself points towards a negative sentiment, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's estimated fair value suggests that the current share price of $223 indicates a 20% undervaluation compared to the intrinsic value of $279. This offers a positive outlook for potential price appreciation. Additionally, there is a forecast for growth in annual earnings over the next three years, which typically would support a bullish sentiment. However, there are concerns related to recent earnings decline, a low dividend compared to peers, and risks associated with a rare underperform rating from analysts. Taking into account the overall mixed sentiment in recent predictions, where some show caution due to underlying challenges but also recognize Apple's market position, I estimate a slightly positive bias for the stock price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall bearish outlook for Apple. A rare 'Underperform' rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster AI feature adoption, is significant. Concerns about China sales and the potential loss of Google search revenue add to the negative sentiment. While Apple's strong service revenue and high margins provide some support, the article explicitly recommends taking profits on the stock due to multiple expansion and diminishing upgrade cycle prospects. Previous predictions also lean bearish, with the majority assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. Given these factors, I believe the probability of the stock falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  While Apple remains a dominant player, several significant headwinds are highlighted: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of significant service revenue, and the failure of AI features to boost sales as anticipated.  These factors, coupled with a high P/E ratio and Cohen's sale of his stake (a key indicator), strongly suggest a negative market reaction. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. While some models point to a potential rise due to undervaluation or future growth prospects, the immediate impact of the negative news is more likely to outweigh these long-term considerations. The consensus earnings growth prediction of 9% is modest considering the current valuation and doesn't fully offset the immediate negative factors.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle. Additionally, challenges in China, including a significant drop in iPhone sales and the inability to offer AI features there, along with potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case, add to the negative outlook. While Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience, the downgrade and the concerns raised are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70% or higher chance of a decline. Given the combination of the rare underperform rating, weak iPhone sales, and geopolitical challenges, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. However, considering Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model, there is some resilience that could mitigate the negative impact. The mixed outlook and various headwinds, including weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Yet, the possibility of a rise cannot be completely dismissed due to Apple's dominant position in the tech industry and its loyal customer base.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q4 earnings report, highlighting concerns about China and AI strategy. Despite these worries, some analysts believe the issues are manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. The overall earnings picture looks positive, with double-digit growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with a cautious outlook due to the mixed sentiment presented in the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that Apple Inc. has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which has been a common theme among multiple predictions. Several models have indicated a higher likelihood of stock price falling due to this negative development. Despite some optimistic forecasts suggesting slight upward potentials, the recent trend shows increased concern over Apple's performance, notably in key markets like China and in critical areas like AI. Given the consistency across models for a bearish outlook, combined with the rarity of the underperform rating, it is reasonable to predict a greater probability of stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple's estimated fair value at $279, indicating a 20% undervaluation compared to the current share price of $223. This supports a bullish outlook for the stock, suggesting potential upside. However, there are concerns regarding declining earnings, a low dividend compared to peers, and a rare 'Underperform' rating from analysts citing challenges in key markets and product cycles. While the positive valuation and earnings growth projections provide some support for price appreciation, the negative sentiment surrounding performance metrics introduces considerable risk factors. Overall, the estimates lean towards a higher probability of a price fall due to recent analyst sentiments and market concerns, balanced against the inherent undervaluation and growth potential of Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on a rare 'Underperform' rating for Apple due to concerns about iPhone sales, AI adoption, and challenges in China. These are significant negative catalysts. While Apple's services revenue is a strength, the market tends to react strongly to downgrades and concerns about future product cycles, especially when AI is a key growth narrative. The previous round of predictions largely leaned bearish, acknowledging these headwinds. Taking these factors into consideration and seeing that Apple has been struggling in China, it is more probable that the article could negatively affect the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple.  The sale of Apple stock by a prominent investor like Steven Cohen is a significant bearish signal.  Furthermore, the article details several substantial headwinds: declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue loss from the Google search dispute, and the disappointing lack of an AI-driven upgrade cycle. These factors, coupled with Apple's high P/E ratio, heavily outweigh the positive aspects, such as its strong services business and projected 9% earnings growth (which is modest relative to the valuation).  The consensus among previous predictions leans heavily towards a price drop, further reinforcing this assessment. While Apple's market dominance and loyal customer base provide some resilience, the immediate impact of the negative news is likely to outweigh these long-term positives. The probability of a price fall is therefore considered significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle.

The overall earnings picture looks positive, with double-digit growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering the mixed sentiment presented in the article and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the concerns about China and AI strategy introduce some uncertainty, making the probability of a fall not negligible. The probabilities are estimated based on the analysis of the news content, the company's current situation, and the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc., which is a notable negative signal. Previous predictions have shown a range of sentiments, with most indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling. Apple faces significant headwinds such as declining iPhone sales in China and concerns over its AI strategy, all contributing to a bearish outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience. The combination of rare underperform ratings and market concerns, alongside the negative sentiments expressed in prior rounds, leads to a cautious prediction leaning towards a stock price fall.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple's stock is currently undervalued at $223 compared to its estimated fair value of $279, suggesting a potential upside of 20%. However, a rare 'Underperform' rating from analysts, along with concerns over declining iPhone sales and challenges in key markets, introduces significant risk factors. Despite the potential for growth and positive cash flow projections, the overall sentiment in the market appears cautious given the recent analyst downgrades and challenges faced by Apple. Therefore, while there's a bullish outlook based on valuation, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock leads to a greater probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analyst downgrade to 'Underperform' is a significant negative signal, especially given the rarity of such ratings for Apple. The concerns about weak iPhone shipments, lackluster AI adoption (and issues in China), and the potential loss of Google search revenue all point towards a bearish outlook. While Apple's strong services revenue provides some support, the immediate market reaction to the downgrade is likely to be negative. The trend in previous predictions has largely leaned bearish, reinforcing this view. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple, but the negative factors appear to outweigh the positives, leading to a prediction of a higher probability of a price fall.  The most significant negative is the rare 'underperform' rating from Jefferies, highlighting concerns about weak iPhone sales, lackluster AI adoption, and challenges in China.  Steven Cohen's selling of his Apple stock further reinforces this bearish sentiment. While Apple's services business and projected earnings growth offer some support, these are insufficient to counter the weight of the negative news and the consistent bearish predictions from previous models. The potential loss of significant revenue from the Google search dispute adds to the uncertainty and risk.  The previous model's predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a price drop, reinforcing this analysis.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher based on the significant negative news and the consensus of prior analyses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The rare 'Underperform' rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, is a significant bearish signal. Additional headwinds include declining iPhone sales in China, potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case, and a high P/E ratio. While Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience, the immediate impact of the downgrade and the concerns raised are likely to negatively affect investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70% or higher chance of a decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. Multiple models have consistently predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this negative development, citing concerns over weak iPhone shipments, lackluster consumer interest in AI features, challenges in China, and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case. While Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience, the consensus among previous predictions leans heavily towards a price drop. Therefore, considering the rare underperform rating and the market concerns, it is reasonable to predict a greater probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q4 earnings report, highlighting concerns about China and AI strategy.

(AAPL) from a respected Wall Street analyst, which is a significant negative signal. Multiple models and predictions provided in previous rounds consistently point to a higher probability of the stock price falling. While Apple still retains robust services revenue and a strong market position, recent concerns about China, weak iPhone shipments, lackluster AI features, and a high P/E ratio outweigh bullish sentiments. Most predictions lean heavily towards a higher probability of a price fall. Hence, considering the mixed but generally negative sentiment, I estimate that there is a significantly higher probability that the stock price will fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
