(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple's current share price of $223 is perceived as undervalued, with an estimated fair value of $279, suggesting a 20% upside potential. Analyst price targets averaging around $246 also support a bullish outlook despite a noted decline in earnings over the past year. Given the positive valuation sentiment and the forecast for annual earnings growth in the next three years, there exists a stronger probability for the stock to rise. However, the warning signs regarding management and slower earnings growth compared to the American market introduce some risk factors that could lead to a downward movement. Overall, the bullish sentiment derived from the undervaluation and positive forecast outweighs the negatives.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of AI features to drive an expected upgrade cycle.  These factors, along with Apple's high P/E ratio, suggest a considerable risk of a price drop. However, Apple remains a dominant player in the tech industry with a loyal customer base and considerable revenue from its services segment.  The 9% earnings growth expectation for the next year offers some counterbalance to the negative factors.  Therefore, while the probabilities favor a price fall based on the current news and analysis, the possibility of a rise cannot be completely dismissed due to Apple's overall market position.  The uncertainty surrounding the future impact of the mentioned headwinds makes a precise prediction difficult.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple due to weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience. Given the downgrade and the concerns raised, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term, but the long-term impact may be mitigated by Apple's diversified revenue streams.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. Such a downgrade can lead to a decrease in investor confidence and potentially cause the stock price to fall. Given that the rating is rare, it may draw significant attention and have a pronounced effect on the stock's short-term performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings season, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of the major companies reporting its results. The article mentions that Apple's shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also provides a positive outlook for the overall earnings picture, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that Apple Inc. has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which suggests a pessimistic outlook on the stock's future performance. Generally, such ratings can lead to a decline in investor confidence, resulting in potential selling pressure on the stock. While it's important to consider various factors like company fundamentals, market conditions, and broader economic trends, the news item itself points towards a negative sentiment, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's estimated fair value suggests that the current share price of $223 indicates a 20% undervaluation compared to the intrinsic value of $279. This offers a positive outlook for potential price appreciation. Additionally, there is a forecast for growth in annual earnings over the next three years, which typically would support a bullish sentiment. However, there are concerns related to recent earnings decline, a low dividend compared to peers, and risks associated with a rare underperform rating from analysts. Taking into account the overall mixed sentiment in recent predictions, where some show caution due to underlying challenges but also recognize Apple's market position, I estimate a slightly positive bias for the stock price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall bearish outlook for Apple. A rare 'Underperform' rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster AI feature adoption, is significant. Concerns about China sales and the potential loss of Google search revenue add to the negative sentiment. While Apple's strong service revenue and high margins provide some support, the article explicitly recommends taking profits on the stock due to multiple expansion and diminishing upgrade cycle prospects. Previous predictions also lean bearish, with the majority assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. Given these factors, I believe the probability of the stock falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  While Apple remains a dominant player, several significant headwinds are highlighted: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of significant service revenue, and the failure of AI features to boost sales as anticipated.  These factors, coupled with a high P/E ratio and Cohen's sale of his stake (a key indicator), strongly suggest a negative market reaction. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. While some models point to a potential rise due to undervaluation or future growth prospects, the immediate impact of the negative news is more likely to outweigh these long-term considerations. The consensus earnings growth prediction of 9% is modest considering the current valuation and doesn't fully offset the immediate negative factors.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle. Additionally, challenges in China, including a significant drop in iPhone sales and the inability to offer AI features there, along with potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case, add to the negative outlook. While Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience, the downgrade and the concerns raised are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70% or higher chance of a decline. Given the combination of the rare underperform rating, weak iPhone sales, and geopolitical challenges, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. However, considering Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model, there is some resilience that could mitigate the negative impact. The mixed outlook and various headwinds, including weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Yet, the possibility of a rise cannot be completely dismissed due to Apple's dominant position in the tech industry and its loyal customer base.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q4 earnings report, highlighting concerns about China and AI strategy. Despite these worries, some analysts believe the issues are manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. The overall earnings picture looks positive, with double-digit growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with a cautious outlook due to the mixed sentiment presented in the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that Apple Inc. has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which has been a common theme among multiple predictions. Several models have indicated a higher likelihood of stock price falling due to this negative development. Despite some optimistic forecasts suggesting slight upward potentials, the recent trend shows increased concern over Apple's performance, notably in key markets like China and in critical areas like AI. Given the consistency across models for a bearish outlook, combined with the rarity of the underperform rating, it is reasonable to predict a greater probability of stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple's estimated fair value at $279, indicating a 20% undervaluation compared to the current share price of $223. This supports a bullish outlook for the stock, suggesting potential upside. However, there are concerns regarding declining earnings, a low dividend compared to peers, and a rare 'Underperform' rating from analysts citing challenges in key markets and product cycles. While the positive valuation and earnings growth projections provide some support for price appreciation, the negative sentiment surrounding performance metrics introduces considerable risk factors. Overall, the estimates lean towards a higher probability of a price fall due to recent analyst sentiments and market concerns, balanced against the inherent undervaluation and growth potential of Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on a rare 'Underperform' rating for Apple due to concerns about iPhone sales, AI adoption, and challenges in China. These are significant negative catalysts. While Apple's services revenue is a strength, the market tends to react strongly to downgrades and concerns about future product cycles, especially when AI is a key growth narrative. The previous round of predictions largely leaned bearish, acknowledging these headwinds. Taking these factors into consideration and seeing that Apple has been struggling in China, it is more probable that the article could negatively affect the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple.  The sale of Apple stock by a prominent investor like Steven Cohen is a significant bearish signal.  Furthermore, the article details several substantial headwinds: declining iPhone sales in China, potential significant revenue loss from the Google search dispute, and the disappointing lack of an AI-driven upgrade cycle. These factors, coupled with Apple's high P/E ratio, heavily outweigh the positive aspects, such as its strong services business and projected 9% earnings growth (which is modest relative to the valuation).  The consensus among previous predictions leans heavily towards a price drop, further reinforcing this assessment. While Apple's market dominance and loyal customer base provide some resilience, the immediate impact of the negative news is likely to outweigh these long-term positives. The probability of a price fall is therefore considered significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which may not drive an upgrade cycle. Additionally, challenges in China, including a significant drop in iPhone sales and the inability to offer AI features there, along with potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case, add to the negative outlook. While Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience, the downgrade and the concerns raised are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70% or higher chance of a decline. Given the combination of the rare underperform rating, weak iPhone sales, and geopolitical challenges, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. However, considering Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model, there is some resilience that could mitigate the negative impact. The mixed outlook and various headwinds, including weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Yet, the possibility of a rise cannot be completely dismissed due to Apple's dominant position in the tech industry and its loyal customer base.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q4 earnings report, highlighting concerns about China and AI strategy, but also mentioning the potential for Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. The overall earnings picture looks positive, with double-digit growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering the mixed sentiment presented in the article and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the concerns about China and AI strategy introduce some uncertainty, making the probability of a fall not negligible. The probabilities are estimated based on the analysis of the news content, the company's current situation, and the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc., which is a notable negative signal. Previous predictions have shown a range of sentiments, with most indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling. Apple faces significant headwinds such as declining iPhone sales in China and concerns over its AI strategy, all contributing to a bearish outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience. The combination of rare underperform ratings and market concerns, alongside the negative sentiments expressed in prior rounds, leads to a cautious prediction leaning towards a stock price fall.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple's stock is currently undervalued at $223 compared to its estimated fair value of $279, suggesting a potential upside of 20%. However, a rare 'Underperform' rating from analysts, along with concerns over declining iPhone sales and challenges in key markets, introduces significant risk factors. Despite the potential for growth and positive cash flow projections, the overall sentiment in the market appears cautious given the recent analyst downgrades and challenges faced by Apple. Therefore, while there's a bullish outlook based on valuation, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock leads to a greater probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analyst downgrade to 'Underperform' is a significant negative signal, especially given the rarity of such ratings for Apple. The concerns about weak iPhone shipments, lackluster AI adoption (and issues in China), and the potential loss of Google search revenue all point towards a bearish outlook. While Apple's strong services revenue provides some support, the immediate market reaction to the downgrade is likely to be negative. The trend in previous predictions has largely leaned bearish, reinforcing this view. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple, but the negative factors appear to outweigh the positives, leading to a prediction of a higher probability of a price fall.  The most significant negative is the rare 'underperform' rating from Jefferies, highlighting concerns about weak iPhone sales, lackluster AI adoption, and challenges in China.  Steven Cohen's selling of his Apple stock further reinforces this bearish sentiment. While Apple's services business and projected earnings growth offer some support, these are insufficient to counter the weight of the negative news and the consistent bearish predictions from previous models. The potential loss of significant revenue from the Google search dispute adds to the uncertainty and risk.  The previous model's predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a price drop, reinforcing this analysis.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher based on the significant negative news and the consensus of prior analyses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The rare 'Underperform' rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, is a significant bearish signal. Additional headwinds include declining iPhone sales in China, potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case, and a high P/E ratio. While Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience, the immediate impact of the downgrade and the concerns raised are likely to negatively affect investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70% or higher chance of a decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is typically a negative signal for the stock. This kind of rating suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market average. Multiple models have consistently predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this negative development, citing concerns over weak iPhone shipments, lackluster consumer interest in AI features, challenges in China, and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case. While Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some resilience, the consensus among previous predictions leans heavily towards a price drop. Therefore, considering the rare underperform rating and the market concerns, it is reasonable to predict a greater probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q4 earnings report, highlighting concerns about China and AI strategy. However, some analysts believe the issues are manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. The overall earnings picture looks positive, with double-digit growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Considering the mixed sentiment presented in the article and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the concerns about China and AI strategy introduce some uncertainty, making the probability of a fall not negligible.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from a respected Wall Street analyst, which is a significant negative signal. Multiple models and predictions provided in previous rounds consistently point to a higher probability of the stock price falling. While Apple still retains robust services revenue and a strong market position, recent concerns about China, weak iPhone shipments, lackluster AI features, and a high P/E ratio outweigh bullish sentiments. Most predictions lean heavily towards a higher probability of a price fall. Hence, considering the mixed but generally negative sentiment, I estimate that there is a significantly higher probability that the stock price will fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
