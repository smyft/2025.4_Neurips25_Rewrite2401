      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Streaming turned profits in 2024. Wall Street's biggest worry is whether momentum can last.\nNews Content: For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.\n\nIn 2024, that finally changed.\n\nThe five giants \u2014 Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) \u2014 collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNetflix led the charge, pulling in roughly $6.9 billion in earnings in the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the company the unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reported an additional $1.87 billion in profits to end the fourth quarter \u2014 and nearly 20 million more subscribers.\n\nThe other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.\n\nLast year delivered some early answers. Disney and Paramount Global each reported their first quarter of streaming profits in August. Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as \"progress,\" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.\n\nFor Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is \"the pace of revenue growth.\" He added, \"To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.\"\n\nFor traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. \"Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.\n\nThat low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns. Lourdes Balduque via Getty Images\n\nIn response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers through controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.\n\nCompanies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.\n\n\"Everything was kind of messy for a few years,\" Macquarie's Nollen said. \"Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.\"\n\n(edited)\n\nOne obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. (Netflix became the latest platform to boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)\n\n\"The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,\" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, \"there's a limit\" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.\n\n\"Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,\" he said.\n\nTo combat fickle subscribers, competing platforms are now bundling their services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, \"There's more strength together.\"\n\n\"I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,\" Dolgin said. \"So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.\"\n\nAnd if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix \u2014 and just basic survival in the streaming-first era \u2014 might be a bumpy one.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NFLX)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline pertains specifically to investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, which is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations or performance. Since the information provided doesn't have any significant implications for Apple's stock price, it is unlikely to cause major movements either way. Therefore, I estimate a neutral probability of rise or fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is incorporating AI (Apple Intelligence) into its products and has strong ecosystem durability, the revenue growth is slowing. Goldman Sachs lowered the price target, citing lower iPhone sales, even though they maintain a \"Buy\" rating. The article suggests optimism for future iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence rollout but not until fiscal 2026. Competition in China is cited as a present concern, with potential sentiment improvement midyear based on future developments. The article also emphasizes 'superior' AI stocks than AAPL that can deliver a shorter time frame with significant returns, implying that in the short term AAPL isn't the best choice for an investor. Furthermore, the article implies that some hedge funds are buying 'other' trending AI stocks, suggesting potentially increased investment in 'other' AI companies than AAPL. Due to the mixed signals, slightly more weight is given to the negative elements (slower growth, price target downgrade, competition) than the long-term potential, indicating a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall in the short-term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, highlighting the collective success of major players like Netflix, Disney, and others. While this is generally positive, the article also emphasizes significant challenges.  These include maintaining profitability (margins are still low for most except Netflix), combating subscriber churn in the face of price increases, and the competitive landscape.  The uncertainty around the sustainability of this newfound profitability and the potential limitations of growth (both subscriber base and price increases) create a cautious outlook. While the positive news of streaming profits could initially boost Apple's stock (as Apple TV+ is part of their services segment), the overall cautious tone regarding the future of streaming profitability and the article's focus on other companies limits the extent of the positive impact.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a neutral probability (0.5), and a price fall, driven by concerns about the broader streaming market, is more likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which could dampen revenue growth. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some counterbalance. Given the rarity of such downgrades and the immediate market reaction they often trigger, the probability of a stock price fall is higher in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the news that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst due to weak iPhone shipments and lack of consumer interest in AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has set a price target of $200.75. Despite this, Apple has a strong business model with high-margin services revenue, which could offset the decline in iPhone sales. However, the company faces risks such as the Alphabet antitrust case and increasing competition in China. Given the mixed outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that a well-known investor, Steven Cohen, has sold Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI company with strong performance. Investors often view such moves by experts as significant indicators. However, Cohen's move alone is not definitive proof of Apple's future performance. The effect on Apple's stock could be negative if it causes other investors to lose confidence, but it might also be viewed as an opportunity for a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news scenario. Overall, this news could have a slightly negative impact.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or financial outlook. Most previous analyses indicated a mixture of challenges for Apple including slow revenue growth, competition, and negative ratings from analysts. The neutral nature of the news suggests that it will not significantly influence investor sentiment positively or negatively for Apple. Given the mixed signals from analysts emphasizing both caution and potential long-term growth, I estimate a slight edge towards a stock price fall, aligning with the previously observed trends. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a similar cautious stance taken by other models.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it discusses the company's foray into AI with 'Apple Intelligence' and mentions Goldman Sachs' 'Buy' rating, the analyst firm also lowered its price target due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales and increased competition in China. The article suggests potential improvements in sentiment mid-year based on upcoming product launches and new AI features, but also highlights that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering the slightly negative immediate impact of the price target downgrade and caution concerning 'other AI stocks', this reinforces the previous rounds which show a negative outlook. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term. However, sentiment may change following the release of future AI plans.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, which is positive for the overall media landscape. However, the article emphasizes the challenges faced by these companies: maintaining profitability with low margins (except for Netflix), combating subscriber churn due to price increases, and intense competition. While Apple's Apple TV+ is included in their services, this news has limited direct impact on Apple's stock price.  The article's focus is on other companies, and the overall cautious outlook regarding the future of streaming profitability outweighs the potential positive impact on Apple.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a general leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the indirect relevance and the general uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of streaming profits for even the dominant players, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall for Apple, although the effect will likely be minimal because the news is not directly related to Apple\u2019s core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which could dampen revenue growth. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some counterbalance. Given the rarity of such downgrades and the immediate market reaction they often trigger, the probability of a stock price fall is higher in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content focus on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, specifically mentioning major players like Netflix, Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal's Peacock, and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max. The news highlights that these companies collectively reported a profit for the first time, but also emphasizes the challenges ahead, such as maintaining profitability, combating subscriber churn, and the competitive landscape. Apple's stock (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the news. However, as Apple has its own streaming service, Apple TV+, the positive trend in the streaming industry could have a mildly positive impact on Apple's stock. Nonetheless, the cautious tone regarding the future of streaming profitability and the focus on other companies limit the extent of the positive impact. Given the neutral to slightly positive implications for Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. receiving a rare underperform rating from Jefferies due to weak iPhone shipments and lack of consumer interest in AI features presents a mixed outlook. On one hand, Apple's strong business model with high-margin services revenue provides a counterbalance. On the other hand, the company faces risks such as the Alphabet antitrust case and increasing competition in China. Considering the predictions from other models, which indicate a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the potential impact of the underperform rating and the challenges in the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Steven Cohen, a well-known billionaire investor, has sold his Apple stock and invested in a little-known AI stock that has seen significant gains. Such decisions made by experienced investors often influence the confidence of retail investors. Moreover, the news mentions specific concerns about the future revenue growth of Apple due to slower iPhone sales and increasing competition in markets like China. There is also reference to the Alphabet antitrust case, which adds another layer of risk. The combined effect of these factors points towards a negative sentiment, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline, which focuses on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), has no direct relevance to Apple's core business operations or recent performance metrics. Previous analyses indicate a mix of concerns surrounding Apple, such as slowing revenue growth, competition, and analyst downgrades linked to weak iPhone sales. While there are mentions of potential long-term growth opportunities, particularly in AI, the overall sentiment from earlier predictions leans slightly negative considering the external pressures Apple faces. Given the neutral nature of the current news and the prevailing negative sentiment from the past predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple. While Apple is investing in AI ('Apple Intelligence') and has a strong ecosystem, there are concerns about slower revenue growth and increasing competition in China. Goldman Sachs lowered its price target, despite maintaining a 'Buy' rating. The focus on 'other AI stocks' that may offer faster returns also suggests that AAPL is not the optimal choice for immediate gains. Previous predictions trended toward a slightly higher probability of a price fall. Given these factors, I lean slightly towards a negative short-term outlook, but the company's long-term AI investments and ecosystem strength prevent a strongly negative prediction. There is a slight increase in predicted rise probability based on the trend of previous estimations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, which is indirectly relevant to Apple through its Apple TV+ service. While the overall trend of streaming profitability is positive, the article highlights significant challenges: maintaining profitability with low margins (except Netflix), combating subscriber churn with price increases, and intense competition.  The article's cautious tone regarding the long-term sustainability of streaming profits outweighs the potential positive impact on Apple.  The news is not directly about Apple, and the impact on its stock price will likely be minimal. Considering the previous predictions which show a general trend towards a higher probability of a price fall for Apple, and the lack of direct relevance and uncertainty surrounding the news, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall, although the effect is likely to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which could dampen revenue growth.
