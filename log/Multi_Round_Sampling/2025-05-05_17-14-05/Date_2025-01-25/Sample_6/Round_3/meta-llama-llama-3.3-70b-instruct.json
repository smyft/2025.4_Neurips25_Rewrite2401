(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?\nNews Content: In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It Time to Sell the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline pertains specifically to investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, which is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations or performance. Since the information provided doesn't have any significant implications for Apple's stock price, it is unlikely to cause major movements either way. Therefore, I estimate a neutral probability of rise or fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is incorporating AI (Apple Intelligence) into its products and has strong ecosystem durability, the revenue growth is slowing. Goldman Sachs lowered the price target, citing lower iPhone sales, even though they maintain a \"Buy\" rating. The article suggests optimism for future iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence rollout but not until fiscal 2026. Competition in China is cited as a present concern, with potential sentiment improvement midyear based on future developments. The article also emphasizes 'superior' AI stocks than AAPL that can deliver a shorter time frame with significant returns, implying that in the short term AAPL isn't the best choice for an investor. Furthermore, the article implies that some hedge funds are buying 'other' trending AI stocks, suggesting potentially increased investment in 'other' AI companies than AAPL. Due to the mixed signals, slightly more weight is given to the negative elements (slower growth, price target downgrade, competition) than the long-term potential, indicating a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall in the short-term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, highlighting the collective success of major players like Netflix, Disney, and others. While this is generally positive, the article also emphasizes significant challenges.  These include maintaining profitability (margins are still low for most except Netflix), combating subscriber churn in the face of price increases, and the competitive landscape.  The uncertainty around the sustainability of this newfound profitability and the potential limitations of growth (both subscriber base and price increases) create a cautious outlook. While the positive news of streaming profits could initially boost Apple's stock (as Apple TV+ is part of their services segment), the overall cautious tone regarding the future of streaming profitability and the article's focus on other companies limits the extent of the positive impact.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a neutral probability (0.5), and a price fall, driven by concerns about the broader streaming market, is more likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which could dampen revenue growth. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some counterbalance. Given the rarity of such downgrades and the immediate market reaction they often trigger, the probability of a stock price fall is higher in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the news that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst due to weak iPhone shipments and lack of consumer interest in AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has set a price target of $200.75. Despite this, Apple has a strong business model with high-margin services revenue, which could offset the decline in iPhone sales. However, the company faces risks such as the Alphabet antitrust case and increasing competition in China. Given the mixed outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that a well-known investor, Steven Cohen, has sold Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI company with strong performance. Investors often view such moves by experts as significant indicators. However, Cohen's move alone is not definitive proof of Apple's future performance. The effect on Apple's stock could be negative if it causes other investors to lose confidence, but it might also be viewed as an opportunity for a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news scenario. Overall, this news could have a slightly negative impact.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or financial outlook. Most previous analyses indicated a mixture of challenges for Apple including slow revenue growth, competition, and negative ratings from analysts. The neutral nature of the news suggests that it will not significantly influence investor sentiment positively or negatively for Apple. Given the mixed signals from analysts emphasizing both caution and potential long-term growth, I estimate a slight edge towards a stock price fall, aligning with the previously observed trends. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a similar cautious stance taken by other models.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it discusses the company's foray into AI with 'Apple Intelligence' and mentions Goldman Sachs' 'Buy' rating, the analyst firm also lowered its price target due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales and increased competition in China. The article suggests potential improvements in sentiment mid-year based on upcoming product launches and new AI features, but also highlights that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering the slightly negative immediate impact of the price target downgrade and caution concerning 'other AI stocks', this reinforces the previous rounds which show a negative outlook. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term. However, sentiment may change following the release of future AI plans.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, which is positive for the overall media landscape. However, the article emphasizes the challenges faced by these companies: maintaining profitability with low margins (except for Netflix), combating subscriber churn due to price increases, and intense competition. While Apple's Apple TV+ is included in their services, this news has limited direct impact on Apple's stock price.  The article's focus is on other companies, and the overall cautious outlook regarding the future of streaming profitability outweighs the potential positive impact on Apple.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a general leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the indirect relevance and the general uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of streaming profits for even the dominant players, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall for Apple, although the effect will likely be minimal because the news is not directly related to Apple\u2019s core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which could dampen revenue growth. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some counterbalance. Given the rarity of such downgrades and the immediate market reaction they often trigger, the probability of a stock price fall is higher in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content focus on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, specifically mentioning major players like Netflix, Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal's Peacock, and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max. The news highlights that these companies collectively reported a profit for the first time, but also emphasizes the challenges ahead, such as maintaining profitability, combating subscriber churn, and the competitive landscape. Apple's stock (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the news. However, as Apple has its own streaming service, Apple TV+, the positive trend in the streaming industry could have a mildly positive impact on Apple's stock. Nonetheless, the cautious tone regarding the future of streaming profitability and the focus on other companies limit the extent of the positive impact. Given the neutral to slightly positive implications for Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. receiving a rare underperform rating from Jefferies due to weak iPhone shipments and lack of consumer interest in AI features presents a mixed outlook. On one hand, Apple's strong business model with high-margin services revenue provides a counterbalance. On the other hand, the company faces risks such as the Alphabet antitrust case and increasing competition in China. Considering the predictions from other models, which indicate a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the potential impact of the underperform rating and the challenges in the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Steven Cohen, a well-known billionaire investor, has sold his Apple stock and invested in a little-known AI stock that has seen significant gains. Such decisions made by experienced investors often influence the confidence of retail investors. Moreover, the news mentions specific concerns about the future revenue growth of Apple due to slower iPhone sales and increasing competition in markets like China. There is also reference to the Alphabet antitrust case, which adds another layer of risk. The combined effect of these factors points towards a negative sentiment, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline, which focuses on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), has no direct relevance to Apple's core business operations or recent performance metrics. Previous analyses indicate a mix of concerns surrounding Apple, such as slowing revenue growth, competition, and analyst downgrades linked to weak iPhone sales. While there are mentions of potential long-term growth opportunities, particularly in AI, the overall sentiment from earlier predictions leans slightly negative considering the external pressures Apple faces. Given the neutral nature of the current news and the prevailing negative sentiment from the past predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple. While Apple is investing in AI ('Apple Intelligence') and has a strong ecosystem, there are concerns about slower revenue growth and increasing competition in China. Goldman Sachs lowered its price target, despite maintaining a 'Buy' rating. The focus on 'other AI stocks' that may offer faster returns also suggests that AAPL is not the optimal choice for immediate gains. Previous predictions trended toward a slightly higher probability of a price fall. Given these factors, I lean slightly towards a negative short-term outlook, but the company's long-term AI investments and ecosystem strength prevent a strongly negative prediction. There is a slight increase in predicted rise probability based on the trend of previous estimations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, which is indirectly relevant to Apple through its Apple TV+ service. While the overall trend of streaming profitability is positive, the article highlights significant challenges: maintaining profitability with low margins (except Netflix), combating subscriber churn with price increases, and intense competition.  The article's cautious tone regarding the long-term sustainability of streaming profits outweighs the potential positive impact on Apple.  The news is not directly about Apple, and the impact on its stock price will likely be minimal. Considering the previous predictions which show a general trend towards a higher probability of a price fall for Apple, and the lack of direct relevance and uncertainty surrounding the news, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall, although the effect is likely to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which could dampen revenue growth.
