In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence.\n\nA prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nDubbed the \u201cOperator\u201d, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields.\n\n\u201cThis capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications\u201d.\n\nOpenAI says Operator is \u201can agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you\u201d. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations.\n\nThe company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows.\n\n\u201cOperator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it\u201d.\n\nBased on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention.\n\n\u201cAI agents are going to get deployed. I think this year we\u2019re going to see it take off\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, areas such as software engineering, digital marketing, and customer service are the first where AI agents can add value. As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls for Thursday, January 23, has been for Apple Inc. Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cBuy\u201d and lowered its price target to $280 per share from $286. The price target downgrade, driven by lower iPhone sales, comes ahead of the company\u2019s December-quarter earnings report next week. The firm anticipates the tech giant to report fiscal Q1 earnings per share of $2.35, in line with consensus, and revenue of $124.2B versus the consensus of $124.8B. According to the firm, even though the competition within the Chinese market is increasing, it is optimistic about accelerating iPhone growth in fiscal 2026. This iPhone growth will largely be driven by the continued rollout of Apple Intelligence with a more robust feature set.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate market sentiment to improve midyear, which is a seasonally strong period for the stock, as concerns about Apple Intelligence\u2019s limited impact on iPhone demand and competition in China are replaced by optimism over the new slate of Apple Intelligence features revealed at WWDC 2025, the launch of new Mac, iPad and iPhone SE products in spring 2025, and potential new features for the iPhone 17/18 in fall 2025/26\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline pertains specifically to investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, which is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations or performance. Since the information provided doesn't have any significant implications for Apple's stock price, it is unlikely to cause major movements either way. Therefore, I estimate a neutral probability of rise or fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is incorporating AI (Apple Intelligence) into its products and has strong ecosystem durability, the revenue growth is slowing. Goldman Sachs lowered the price target, citing lower iPhone sales, even though they maintain a \"Buy\" rating. The article suggests optimism for future iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence rollout but not until fiscal 2026. Competition in China is cited as a present concern, with potential sentiment improvement midyear based on future developments. The article also emphasizes 'superior' AI stocks than AAPL that can deliver a shorter time frame with significant returns, implying that in the short term AAPL isn't the best choice for an investor. Furthermore, the article implies that some hedge funds are buying 'other' trending AI stocks, suggesting potentially increased investment in 'other' AI companies than AAPL. Due to the mixed signals, slightly more weight is given to the negative elements (slower growth, price target downgrade, competition) than the long-term potential, indicating a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall in the short-term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, highlighting the collective success of major players like Netflix, Disney, and others. While this is generally positive, the article also emphasizes significant challenges.  These include maintaining profitability (margins are still low for most except Netflix), combating subscriber churn in the face of price increases, and the competitive landscape.  The uncertainty around the sustainability of this newfound profitability and the potential limitations of growth (both subscriber base and price increases) create a cautious outlook. While the positive news of streaming profits could initially boost Apple's stock (as Apple TV+ is part of their services segment), the overall cautious tone regarding the future of streaming profitability and the article's focus on other companies limits the extent of the positive impact.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a neutral probability (0.5), and a price fall, driven by concerns about the broader streaming market, is more likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which could dampen revenue growth. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue and high-margin business model provide some counterbalance. Given the rarity of such downgrades and the immediate market reaction they often trigger, the probability of a stock price fall is higher in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the news that Apple Inc. received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst due to weak iPhone shipments and lack of consumer interest in AI features. The analyst expects Apple to miss revenue estimates and has set a price target of $200.75. Despite this, Apple has a strong business model with high-margin services revenue, which could offset the decline in iPhone sales. However, the company faces risks such as the Alphabet antitrust case and increasing competition in China. Given the mixed outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that a well-known investor, Steven Cohen, has sold Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI company with strong performance. Investors often view such moves by experts as significant indicators. However, Cohen's move alone is not definitive proof of Apple's future performance. The effect on Apple's stock could be negative if it causes other investors to lose confidence, but it might also be viewed as an opportunity for a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news scenario. Overall, this news could have a slightly negative impact.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
