(AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

A considerable number of these stocks present enticing annual dividend yields and possess defensive attributes that enable them to maintain stability in a bear market. Additionally, we\u2019ve identified promising tech stocks that currently pose as appealing entry opportunities for investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company emerges as a prime investment opportunity for several reasons. First and foremost, the company\u2019s robust financial health is depicted in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue was $94.9 billion, increasing 6% year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share was $0.97. This shows the increasing demand for the company\u2019s products or services and its ability to generate earnings for shareholders. Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2024, the company declared quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, totaling $0.96 per share annually. Secondly, the company has also introduced a general health-monitoring tool in all its new devices. For instance, an Apple Watch can monitor heart rate, check for atrial fibrillation, detect falls and car crashes, monitor blood-oxygen levels, and track body temperature for fertility planning.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's continued reliance on Apple as a significant source of dividend income, despite reducing his stake. The mention of a strong dividend yield could reassure investors about Apple's financial health, leading to increased demand for the stock. Additionally, Buffett's association with successful investments tends to reflect positively on the companies in which he is invested. However, his reduced stake might create some concern about his long-term confidence in the company's prospects. Overall, the news leans positive, but the uncertainty around Buffett's stake reduction introduces some slight bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is investing in AI (Apple Intelligence) and is a major player with a strong ecosystem, the article highlights concerns about slower revenue growth, particularly due to iPhone sales and competition in China. A Goldman Sachs downgrade (though still a \"Buy\" rating) further reinforces this concern. While they are optimistic about future growth driven by AI features and product releases in 2025/2026, the immediate impact is less certain. The article also pitches other AI stocks as potentially having higher returns in a shorter timeframe, suggesting AAPL might be a slower grower. The near-term pressure from potentially weaker iPhone sales and competitive pressures, coupled with the suggestion of better performing AI stocks elsewhere, will offset the long-term AI investment upside.\nGiven the mixed signals, there isn't a clear positive catalyst. The downward revision from Goldman Sachs is negative, but still a positive outlook. The AI hype has already been largely priced into the stock and thus the short-term outlook appears bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts),  the overall economic climate is uncertain. Several experts predict a potential bear market, with some forecasting significant declines (up to 40%).  However, others maintain a more optimistic view, pointing to continued economic resilience and strong consumer spending. The article highlights increased foreign investment in US stocks, which is historically associated with market downturns.  Apple's inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks' suggests it's considered relatively resilient, but the article itself acknowledges that other stocks might offer better returns.  The article's emphasis on the potential for a bear market, coupled with the generally cautious economic outlook and the contradictory signals from increased foreign investment, leans towards a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, although the probability of a rise isn't negligible due to Apple's strong financials.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, highlighting Apple's inclusion in various iterations of these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, and now BATMMAAN). The emphasis is on market trends and groupings rather than specific financial performance or strategic developments for Apple. Given that Apple remains a core component of these influential tech groups, the news is likely neutral to slightly positive as it reinforces Apple's status as a market leader. However, there is no direct positive or negative catalyst mentioned that would strongly influence the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential to use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks, particularly with the rise of eSims. This could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny on Apple. Historically, regulatory scrutiny can negatively impact tech stocks. However, Apple's strong market position and diversified business model might mitigate the negative impact. The probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be lower due to potential regulatory risks, while the probability of a stock price fall is estimated to be higher due to the increased regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article reports a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, citing weak iPhone shipments and a lack of consumer interest in Apple's artificial intelligence features. The analyst expects Apple to miss current revenue estimates and has set a price target of $200.75. However, the article also highlights Apple's strong business model, high-margin services revenue, and steady earnings growth. Considering the rare underperform rating, the potential disappointment in iPhone sales, and the current multiple expansion of Apple's stock price, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that a well-known investor, Steven Cohen, has sold Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI company with strong performance. Investors often view such moves by experts as significant indicators. However, Cohen's move alone is not definitive proof of Apple's future performance. The effect on Apple's stock could be negative if it causes other investors to lose confidence, but it might also be viewed as an opportunity for a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news scenario. There is typically a mix of reactions in the market to such news.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued importance in Warren Buffett's portfolio, serving as a significant source of dividend income. Buffett's association typically indicates stability and long-term confidence in a stock, which can have a positive impact on investor sentiment. However, the news does not provide strong catalysts for growth; it mainly confirms Apple's status as a dividend payer. Previous analysis suggests mixed sentiments about Apple's short-term performance due to competitive pressures, potentially weaker iPhone sales, and some analysts predicting a bear market. Given Buffett's reduced stake, there may be bearish sentiment, but the association with his investment success still gives some weight to a positive outlook. Thus, I estimate a slight edge towards a price rise, but overall caution leads to a lower probability of significant upward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, it highlights Apple's efforts in AI with 'Apple Intelligence' and acknowledges its strong ecosystem. It mentions a price target downgrade by Goldman Sachs, but still a 'Buy' rating, indicating some faith in the company's future. The article also suggests that Apple might not be the fastest-growing AI stock, implying there are potentially better short-term investments elsewhere, which is mildly bearish. The previous predictions show a downward trend in sentiment, emphasizing slower revenue growth concerns and competitive pressures. Given the continuing ambiguity and prior negative predictions, the probability of a stock price fall remains slightly elevated due to concerns about iPhone sales, competitive pressures, and potentially better AI investment alternatives.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts, and a strong position in the AI space), the overall macroeconomic climate presents uncertainty.  Predictions for a bear market range from a 22% chance of recession in the next year to a potential 40% market decline. Increased foreign investment, historically a contrarian indicator, adds to the bearish sentiment. Although Apple's inclusion in a 'best bear market stocks' list suggests relative resilience, the article emphasizes that other stocks may offer better returns.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the mixed signals. The strong financials and continued AI investments are bullish, but the macroeconomic uncertainty and potential bear market outweigh these factors in this specific context.  Considering the overall cautiously optimistic economic outlook and the potential for a market correction, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is warranted, even with Apple's generally strong performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, with Apple consistently included in these influential groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN). This reinforces Apple's status as a market leader but does not provide specific financial or strategic catalysts that would directly impact the stock price. Given the neutral to slightly positive nature of the news, and considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds (some leaning bearish due to broader market concerns or specific analyst ratings), the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a rise due to Apple's strong market positioning.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests potential regulatory scrutiny on Apple due to concerns about its market power and the rise of eSims. This could lead to increased regulatory risks for Apple. Historically, regulatory scrutiny has negatively impacted tech stocks. However, Apple's strong market position, diversified business model, and robust financials might mitigate the negative impact. The previous predictions from various models indicate a mixed outlook, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to regulatory risks and others seeing a relatively balanced or slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong fundamentals. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, citing weak iPhone shipments and a lack of consumer interest in Apple's artificial intelligence features. The analyst expects Apple to miss current revenue estimates and has set a price target of $200.75.

Considering the rare underperform rating, the potential disappointment in iPhone sales, and the current multiple expansion of Apple's stock price, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. The analysis from other models also suggests a mixed outlook, with some predicting a higher probability of a price fall due to regulatory risks, weaker iPhone sales, and competitive pressures. Overall, the news leans slightly negative, but Apple's strong financials and market position provide some support to the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Steven Cohen, a prominent investor, has sold Apple stock to invest in a little-known AI stock with significant gains. This shift in investment strategy can have multiple implications. On one hand, Cohen\u2019s move might signal a lack of long-term confidence in the growth potential of Apple, especially in the AI sector where other opportunities seem more compelling. On the other hand, it does not necessarily mean that Apple\u2019s business fundamentals have deteriorated. The broader market and individual investor reactions to such news can vary, but historically, actions of high-profile investors can sway market sentiments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's substantial expected dividend income from Apple and other stocks, emphasizing Buffett's longstanding confidence in Apple as a key investment. However, it also notes his reduced stake in Apple, which could reflect some concerns about the company's growth prospects. Despite the positive sentiment associated with dividend income, there are mixed signals regarding Apple's future, such as competitive pressures, potential regulatory risks, and recent predictions of potential market declines. Balancing these factors leads to a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise, but with significant uncertainty surrounding the stock's near-term performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's position among AI stocks, highlighting both its strengths (ecosystem, Apple Intelligence) and weaknesses (slower revenue growth, competition). Goldman Sachs reiterated 'Buy' but lowered the price target, suggesting tempered optimism. The article also mentions potentially better AI stock alternatives, which could divert investment. Previous predictions show fluctuating sentiments, generally trending slightly bearish. Some models emphasize regulatory risks, weaker iPhone sales, and analyst underperform ratings, while others highlight Apple's market leadership and AI investments. Also Steven Cohen, a prominent investor, has sold Apple stock to invest in a little-known AI stock with significant gains. \n\nConsidering the mixed signals and prior predictions leaning bearish, there's slightly higher probability of the stock price falling. The increasing competition in the AI field and the preference of investors to invest in other competitive AI companies also give a negative signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 financials (revenue growth, EPS), a consistent dividend payout, and the expansion of health-monitoring features.  The inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks' suggests relative resilience.  However, several significant bearish factors exist:\n\n* **Macroeconomic Uncertainty:**  The article highlights predictions of a potential bear market (up to 40% decline), increased foreign investment (a historical contrarian indicator), and concerns about inflation and interest rates.\n* **Competitive Pressures and Slower Growth:** The article suggests that other AI stocks might offer better short-term investment opportunities, implying Apple's growth may be slower than competitors.\n* **Analyst Opinions:** While some analysts maintain a positive outlook, others have expressed concerns, including downgrades and predictions of missed revenue targets.\n* **Historical Precedent:**  The article notes a correlation between surges in foreign investment and subsequent market downturns.\n\nThe previous predictions show a trend towards a bearish outlook. While Apple's fundamentals appear strong, the significant macroeconomic uncertainty and competitive landscape override the positive aspects of their financial results. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is deemed higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, with Apple consistently included in influential groups like FAANG, Magnificent Seven, and BATMMAAN.

Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning bearish due to broader market concerns or specific analyst ratings, while others see a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong market positioning. Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed prior predictions, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a rise due to Apple's strong market positioning.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests potential regulatory scrutiny on Apple due to concerns about its market power and the rise of eSims. This could lead to increased regulatory risks for Apple. Historically, regulatory scrutiny has negatively impacted tech stocks.
