(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?\nNews Content: In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It Time to Sell the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's continued reliance on Apple as a significant source of dividend income, despite reducing his stake. The mention of a strong dividend yield could reassure investors about Apple's financial health, leading to increased demand for the stock. Additionally, Buffett's association with successful investments tends to reflect positively on the companies in which he is invested. However, his reduced stake might create some concern about his long-term confidence in the company's prospects. Overall, the news leans positive, but the uncertainty around Buffett's stake reduction introduces some slight bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is investing in AI (Apple Intelligence) and is a major player with a strong ecosystem, the article highlights concerns about slower revenue growth, particularly due to iPhone sales and competition in China. A Goldman Sachs downgrade (though still a \"Buy\" rating) further reinforces this concern. While they are optimistic about future growth driven by AI features and product releases in 2025/2026, the immediate impact is less certain. The article also pitches other AI stocks as potentially having higher returns in a shorter timeframe, suggesting AAPL might be a slower grower. The near-term pressure from potentially weaker iPhone sales and competitive pressures, coupled with the suggestion of better performing AI stocks elsewhere, will offset the long-term AI investment upside.\nGiven the mixed signals, there isn't a clear positive catalyst. The downward revision from Goldman Sachs is negative, but still a positive outlook. The AI hype has already been largely priced into the stock and thus the short-term outlook appears bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts),  the overall economic climate is uncertain. Several experts predict a potential bear market, with some forecasting significant declines (up to 40%).  However, others maintain a more optimistic view, pointing to continued economic resilience and strong consumer spending. The article highlights increased foreign investment in US stocks, which is historically associated with market downturns.  Apple's inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks' suggests it's considered relatively resilient, but the article itself acknowledges that other stocks might offer better returns.  The article's emphasis on the potential for a bear market, coupled with the generally cautious economic outlook and the contradictory signals from increased foreign investment, leans towards a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, although the probability of a rise isn't negligible due to Apple's strong financials.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, highlighting Apple's inclusion in various iterations of these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, and now BATMMAAN). The emphasis is on market trends and groupings rather than specific financial performance or strategic developments for Apple. Given that Apple remains a core component of these influential tech groups, the news is likely neutral to slightly positive as it reinforces Apple's status as a market leader. However, there is no direct positive or negative catalyst mentioned that would strongly influence the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential to use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks, particularly with the rise of eSims. This could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny on Apple. Historically, regulatory scrutiny can negatively impact tech stocks. However, Apple's strong market position and diversified business model might mitigate the negative impact. The probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be lower due to potential regulatory risks, while the probability of a stock price fall is estimated to be higher due to the increased regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article reports a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, citing weak iPhone shipments and a lack of consumer interest in Apple's artificial intelligence features. The analyst expects Apple to miss current revenue estimates and has set a price target of $200.75. However, the article also highlights Apple's strong business model, high-margin services revenue, and steady earnings growth. Considering the rare underperform rating, the potential disappointment in iPhone sales, and the current multiple expansion of Apple's stock price, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that a well-known investor, Steven Cohen, has sold Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI company with strong performance. Investors often view such moves by experts as significant indicators. However, Cohen's move alone is not definitive proof of Apple's future performance. The effect on Apple's stock could be negative if it causes other investors to lose confidence, but it might also be viewed as an opportunity for a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news scenario. There is typically a mix of reactions in the market to such news.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued importance in Warren Buffett's portfolio, serving as a significant source of dividend income. Buffett's association typically indicates stability and long-term confidence in a stock, which can have a positive impact on investor sentiment. However, the news does not provide strong catalysts for growth; it mainly confirms Apple's status as a dividend payer. Previous analysis suggests mixed sentiments about Apple's short-term performance due to competitive pressures, potentially weaker iPhone sales, and some analysts predicting a bear market. Given Buffett's reduced stake, there may be bearish sentiment, but the association with his investment success still gives some weight to a positive outlook. Thus, I estimate a slight edge towards a price rise, but overall caution leads to a lower probability of significant upward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, it highlights Apple's efforts in AI with 'Apple Intelligence' and acknowledges its strong ecosystem. It mentions a price target downgrade by Goldman Sachs, but still a 'Buy' rating, indicating some faith in the company's future. The article also suggests that Apple might not be the fastest-growing AI stock, implying there are potentially better short-term investments elsewhere, which is mildly bearish. The previous predictions show a downward trend in sentiment, emphasizing slower revenue growth concerns and competitive pressures. Given the continuing ambiguity and prior negative predictions, the probability of a stock price fall remains slightly elevated due to concerns about iPhone sales, competitive pressures, and potentially better AI investment alternatives.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company shows strong financial performance (revenue growth, dividend payouts, and a strong position in the AI space), the overall macroeconomic climate presents uncertainty.  Predictions for a bear market range from a 22% chance of recession in the next year to a potential 40% market decline. Increased foreign investment, historically a contrarian indicator, adds to the bearish sentiment. Although Apple's inclusion in a 'best bear market stocks' list suggests relative resilience, the article emphasizes that other stocks may offer better returns.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the mixed signals. The strong financials and continued AI investments are bullish, but the macroeconomic uncertainty and potential bear market outweigh these factors in this specific context.  Considering the overall cautiously optimistic economic outlook and the potential for a market correction, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is warranted, even with Apple's generally strong performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, with Apple consistently included in these influential groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN). This reinforces Apple's status as a market leader but does not provide specific financial or strategic catalysts that would directly impact the stock price. Given the neutral to slightly positive nature of the news, and considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds (some leaning bearish due to broader market concerns or specific analyst ratings), the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a rise due to Apple's strong market positioning.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests potential regulatory scrutiny on Apple due to concerns about its market power and the rise of eSims. This could lead to increased regulatory risks for Apple. Historically, regulatory scrutiny has negatively impacted tech stocks. However, Apple's strong market position, diversified business model, and robust financials might mitigate the negative impact. The previous predictions from various models indicate a mixed outlook, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to regulatory risks and others seeing a relatively balanced or slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong fundamentals. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, citing weak iPhone shipments and a lack of consumer interest in Apple's artificial intelligence features.

Considering the rare underperform rating, the potential disappointment in iPhone sales, and the current multiple expansion of Apple's stock price, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. The analysis from other models also suggests a mixed outlook, with some predicting a higher probability of a price fall due to regulatory risks, weaker iPhone sales, and competitive pressures. Overall, the news leans slightly negative, but Apple's strong financials and market position provide some support to the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Steven Cohen, a prominent investor, has sold Apple stock to invest in a little-known AI stock with significant gains. This shift in investment strategy can have multiple implications. On one hand, Cohen\u2019s move might signal a lack of long-term confidence in the growth potential of Apple, especially in the AI sector where other opportunities seem more compelling. On the other hand, it does not necessarily mean that Apple\u2019s business fundamentals have deteriorated. The broader market and individual investor reactions to such news can vary, but historically, actions of high-profile investors can sway market sentiments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's substantial expected dividend income from Apple and other stocks, emphasizing Buffett's longstanding confidence in Apple as a key investment. However, it also notes his reduced stake in Apple, which could reflect some concerns about the company's growth prospects. Despite the positive sentiment associated with dividend income, there are mixed signals regarding Apple's future, such as competitive pressures, potential regulatory risks, and recent predictions of potential market declines. Balancing these factors leads to a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise, but with significant uncertainty surrounding the stock's near-term performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's position among AI stocks, highlighting both its strengths (ecosystem, Apple Intelligence) and weaknesses (slower revenue growth, competition). Goldman Sachs reiterated 'Buy' but lowered the price target, suggesting tempered optimism. The article also mentions potentially better AI stock alternatives, which could divert investment. Previous predictions show fluctuating sentiments, generally trending slightly bearish. Some models emphasize regulatory risks, weaker iPhone sales, and analyst underperform ratings, while others highlight Apple's market leadership and AI investments. Also Steven Cohen, a prominent investor, has sold Apple stock to invest in a little-known AI stock with significant gains. \n\nConsidering the mixed signals and prior predictions leaning bearish, there's slightly higher probability of the stock price falling. The increasing competition in the AI field and the preference of investors to invest in other competitive AI companies also give a negative signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 financials (revenue growth, EPS), a consistent dividend payout, and the expansion of health-monitoring features.  The inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks' suggests relative resilience.  However, several significant bearish factors exist:\n\n* **Macroeconomic Uncertainty:**  The article highlights predictions of a potential bear market (up to 40% decline), increased foreign investment (a historical contrarian indicator), and concerns about inflation and interest rates.\n* **Competitive Pressures and Slower Growth:** The article suggests that other AI stocks might offer better short-term investment opportunities, implying Apple's growth may be slower than competitors.\n* **Analyst Opinions:** While some analysts maintain a positive outlook, others have expressed concerns, including downgrades and predictions of missed revenue targets.\n* **Historical Precedent:**  The article notes a correlation between surges in foreign investment and subsequent market downturns.\n\nThe previous predictions show a trend towards a bearish outlook. While Apple's fundamentals appear strong, the significant macroeconomic uncertainty and competitive landscape override the positive aspects of their financial results. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is deemed higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, with Apple consistently included in influential groups like FAANG, Magnificent Seven, and BATMMAAN.
