(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that a prominent investor, Steven Cohen, has decided to sell his shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) in favor of investing in another stock that has shown significant growth. This could be interpreted negatively by the market, as it may suggest a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects. Investor sentiment can be heavily influenced by high-profile sell-offs, potentially leading to increased selling pressure on AAPL stock. However, it is important to consider that Cohen's actions might also prompt other investors to re-evaluate their positions, and if there are no additional negative factors affecting Apple, the market may stabilize or even see a rise due to other ongoing positive developments surrounding the company. Overall, these aspects result in a stronger probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a prominent hedge fund manager (Steven Cohen) sold his stake, signaling a lack of confidence. The article cites headwinds, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal challenges with Google, and the perceived failure of AI features to drive an upgrade cycle. The expensive valuation (33x earnings) based primarily on multiple expansion rather than earnings growth is also concerning. All these are factors that suggest that the stock prices falling is reasonably significant. On the other hand, the article on The Motley Fool is indicating buying Apple Stocks. I would prioritize the first part of the article which indicates that Apple's Stock price falling given my interpretation of the data.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q4 earnings. While the overall earnings season is showing positive results, Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China operations and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downward. However, bullish sentiment suggests this negativity might be overdone, pointing to potential partnerships with Chinese AI companies as a mitigating factor.  The article highlights that Apple's net margins are expected to modestly increase, unlike Tesla's slight decrease.  Considering the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted. The probability of a price rise is lower due to the prevailing bearish sentiment and concerns around China and AI strategy, while the probability of a fall is higher but not overwhelmingly so, given the potential for positive news about AI partnerships.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with shares plummeting by 11% and nearing a critical 200-day moving average support level. Analysts suggest that breaching this level could signal further losses, and there is a loss of confidence among traders regarding the uptrend. Despite some optimism from analysts about future growth potential in services and wearables, the immediate sentiment appears negative due to the stock's weak performance and the broader market rally without Apple's participation. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event that could influence the stock's direction, but the current technical indicators and market sentiment suggest a higher probability of a continued decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. Such a rating is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. The headline also questions whether it is time to sell the stock, further implying a potential downside. Given this negative sentiment, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article suggests that Apple Inc. is undervalued by 20% based on the discounted cash flow model, with an estimated fair value of $279. The company's future cash flows are expected to grow, and the current share price of $223 is lower than the estimated fair value. This indicates a potential opportunity for investors. However, the article also notes that valuation is only one aspect of building an investment thesis and that there are other factors to consider, such as risks and management. Given the information provided, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to the perceived undervaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is no direct information in the given headline that indicates any impact on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his shares in Apple (AAPL) and has chosen to invest in a lesser-known AI stock, which could be interpreted negatively by the market. Such actions by prominent investors often lead to reduced confidence in the company and may cause other investors to follow suit, leading to a decline in the stock price. Additionally, there are existing concerns about declining iPhone sales, legal challenges, and an expensive valuation based on earnings growth. Despite some bullish sentiment from analysts suggesting potential undervaluation and future growth opportunities, the immediate impact of a significant sell-off from a high-profile investor generally leans towards a bearish outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but ultimately negative outlook for Apple. Steven Cohen selling his stake, a former second-largest holding, is a significant bearish signal despite the delayed reporting of the move. The specific reasons cited for concern \u2013 declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal issues with Google, and a lack of market excitement around new AI features \u2013 paint a concerning picture. The expensive valuation is another red flag, bolstered more by multiple expansion than earnings growth. While there's an opposing \"double down\" advertisement in the same article, the specific and numerous challenges outlined for Apple outweigh the general bullish marketing. The previous round had most models predicting falling stock price. Considering this information, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\n\nIt is important to note that Axon's positive performance does little to offset the negative press surrounding Apple. While Cohen's purchase of Axon is noteworthy, it doesn't directly influence Apple's stock, especially given the small relative size of the purchase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While the broader market and many S&P 500 companies are showing strong Q4 earnings, Apple's stock has lagged, driven by concerns about its performance in China and its AI strategy.  Analysts are divided, with some predicting a guidance cut while others believe the current bearish sentiment is overdone, pointing to potential future partnerships with Chinese AI companies.  Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve, a positive sign.  Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance. Considering the mixed signals and the uncertainty around the impact of China and AI concerns on Apple's near-term performance, I've assigned a probability slightly higher for a stock price fall.  The upcoming earnings report is the primary factor influencing the probabilities. If the earnings beat expectations, the stock is likely to rise and vice versa. The overall earnings season seems positive, giving a slight edge to the possibility of exceeding earnings expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) facing significant challenges in 2025, with its stock down 11% year-to-date, marking its worst start since 2008. The stock is nearing the 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level, which if breached, could signal further declines. Analysts express concerns about losing confidence in the uptrend, and while some remain optimistic about growth in services and wearables, the immediate sentiment is negative. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is pivotal, but current technical indicators and market sentiment suggest a higher probability of continued decline. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models favoring a 0.7 probability of a fall and 0.3 of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. This rating, combined with the analyst's question of whether it is time to sell the stock, implies a negative outlook. Furthermore, the previous predictions from various models show a prevailing bearish sentiment, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. The average prediction of stock price falling from previous models is around 0.67, while the average prediction of stock price rising is around 0.33. Considering these aspects, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is undervalued by 20% based on the discounted cash flow model, with an estimated fair value of $279. The company's future cash flows are expected to grow, and the current share price of $223 is lower than the estimated fair value. This indicates a potential opportunity for investors. Given the information provided, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to the perceived undervaluation. Additionally, the SWOT analysis highlights the company's strengths, such as debt being well covered by earnings and cash flows, and opportunities, such as annual earnings forecast to grow for the next 3 years. However, the article also notes that valuation is only one aspect of building an investment thesis and that there are other factors to consider, such as risks and management.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc. (AAPL). None of the previous predictions contain information about Apple's performance or stock movements. Since the headline does not directly relate to Apple Inc., it is unlikely to trigger any significant stock price movement. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement is low.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
