(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\nNews Content: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a turbulent beginning to 2025, with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.\n\nWhat Happened: Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth\u2019s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest\u00a0performer in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019\u00a0group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nApple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock\u2019s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.\n\n\u201cWhen\u00a0you get names starting to\u00a0flirt with it or start\u00a0to break below it, you\u00a0kind of lose confidence that\u00a0the uptrend of that name\u00a0is still intact,\u201d Todd Sohn, an ETF\u00a0and technical strategist at Strategas\u00a0Securities LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple\u2019s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline, Nvidia has now overtaken Apple in market value.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. \"It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we're anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off,\" said Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC.\n\nTrending: Coinbase\u2019s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) \u2014 Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer.\n\nApple is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on January 30, after market close, an event that investors are closely watching.\u00a0Despite the stock\u2019s current performance, analysts remain optimistic about Apple\u2019s future. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, believes that Apple\u2019s dependence on the iPhone remains, but services and wearables offer growth potential. Additionally, Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Securities predicts that Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings might not miss a beat, despite a softer iPhone cycle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Apple was planning a \u201cmassive investment\u201d in the United States. This was part of Trump\u2019s initiative to accelerate major corporate investments in the U.S.\n\nPrice Action: Apple shares ended 0.39% lower on Friday. Year-to-date the company\u2019s shares lost 8.64%, as reported by Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\n\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that a prominent investor, Steven Cohen, has decided to sell his shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) in favor of investing in another stock that has shown significant growth. This could be interpreted negatively by the market, as it may suggest a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects. Investor sentiment can be heavily influenced by high-profile sell-offs, potentially leading to increased selling pressure on AAPL stock. However, it is important to consider that Cohen's actions might also prompt other investors to re-evaluate their positions, and if there are no additional negative factors affecting Apple, the market may stabilize or even see a rise due to other ongoing positive developments surrounding the company. Overall, these aspects result in a stronger probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a prominent hedge fund manager (Steven Cohen) sold his stake, signaling a lack of confidence. The article cites headwinds, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal challenges with Google, and the perceived failure of AI features to drive an upgrade cycle. The expensive valuation (33x earnings) based primarily on multiple expansion rather than earnings growth is also concerning. All these are factors that suggest that the stock prices falling is reasonably significant. On the other hand, the article on The Motley Fool is indicating buying Apple Stocks. I would prioritize the first part of the article which indicates that Apple's Stock price falling given my interpretation of the data.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q4 earnings. While the overall earnings season is showing positive results, Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China operations and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downward. However, bullish sentiment suggests this negativity might be overdone, pointing to potential partnerships with Chinese AI companies as a mitigating factor.  The article highlights that Apple's net margins are expected to modestly increase, unlike Tesla's slight decrease.  Considering the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted. The probability of a price rise is lower due to the prevailing bearish sentiment and concerns around China and AI strategy, while the probability of a fall is higher but not overwhelmingly so, given the potential for positive news about AI partnerships.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with shares plummeting by 11% and nearing a critical 200-day moving average support level. Analysts suggest that breaching this level could signal further losses, and there is a loss of confidence among traders regarding the uptrend. Despite some optimism from analysts about future growth potential in services and wearables, the immediate sentiment appears negative due to the stock's weak performance and the broader market rally without Apple's participation. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event that could influence the stock's direction, but the current technical indicators and market sentiment suggest a higher probability of a continued decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. Such a rating is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. The headline also questions whether it is time to sell the stock, further implying a potential downside. Given this negative sentiment, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article suggests that Apple Inc. is undervalued by 20% based on the discounted cash flow model, with an estimated fair value of $279. The company's future cash flows are expected to grow, and the current share price of $223 is lower than the estimated fair value. This indicates a potential opportunity for investors. However, the article also notes that valuation is only one aspect of building an investment thesis and that there are other factors to consider, such as risks and management. Given the information provided, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to the perceived undervaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is no direct information in the given headline that indicates any impact on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his shares in Apple (AAPL) and has chosen to invest in a lesser-known AI stock, which could be interpreted negatively by the market. Such actions by prominent investors often lead to reduced confidence in the company and may cause other investors to follow suit, leading to a decline in the stock price. Additionally, there are existing concerns about declining iPhone sales, legal challenges, and an expensive valuation based on earnings growth. Despite some bullish sentiment from analysts suggesting potential undervaluation and future growth opportunities, the immediate impact of a significant sell-off from a high-profile investor generally leans towards a bearish outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but ultimately negative outlook for Apple. Steven Cohen selling his stake, a former second-largest holding, is a significant bearish signal despite the delayed reporting of the move. The specific reasons cited for concern \u2013 declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal issues with Google, and a lack of market excitement around new AI features \u2013 paint a concerning picture. The expensive valuation is another red flag, bolstered more by multiple expansion than earnings growth. While there's an opposing \"double down\" advertisement in the same article, the specific and numerous challenges outlined for Apple outweigh the general bullish marketing. The previous round had most models predicting falling stock price. Considering this information, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\n\nIt is important to note that Axon's positive performance does little to offset the negative press surrounding Apple. While Cohen's purchase of Axon is noteworthy, it doesn't directly influence Apple's stock, especially given the small relative size of the purchase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While the broader market and many S&P 500 companies are showing strong Q4 earnings, Apple's stock has lagged, driven by concerns about its performance in China and its AI strategy.  Analysts are divided, with some predicting a guidance cut while others believe the current bearish sentiment is overdone, pointing to potential future partnerships with Chinese AI companies.  Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve, a positive sign.  Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance. Considering the mixed signals and the uncertainty around the impact of China and AI concerns on Apple's near-term performance, I've assigned a probability slightly higher for a stock price fall.  The upcoming earnings report is the primary factor influencing the probabilities. If the earnings beat expectations, the stock is likely to rise and vice versa. The overall earnings season seems positive, giving a slight edge to the possibility of exceeding earnings expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) facing significant challenges in 2025, with its stock down 11% year-to-date, marking its worst start since 2008. The stock is nearing the 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level, which if breached, could signal further declines. Analysts express concerns about losing confidence in the uptrend, and while some remain optimistic about growth in services and wearables, the immediate sentiment is negative. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is pivotal, but current technical indicators and market sentiment suggest a higher probability of continued decline. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models favoring a 0.7 probability of a fall and 0.3 of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. This rating, combined with the analyst's question of whether it is time to sell the stock, implies a negative outlook. Furthermore, the previous predictions from various models show a prevailing bearish sentiment, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. The average prediction of stock price falling from previous models is around 0.67, while the average prediction of stock price rising is around 0.33. Considering these aspects, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is undervalued by 20% based on the discounted cash flow model, with an estimated fair value of $279. The company's future cash flows are expected to grow, and the current share price of $223 is lower than the estimated fair value. This indicates a potential opportunity for investors. Given the information provided, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to the perceived undervaluation. Additionally, the SWOT analysis highlights the company's strengths, such as debt being well covered by earnings and cash flows, and opportunities, such as annual earnings forecast to grow for the next 3 years. However, the article also notes that valuation is only one aspect of building an investment thesis and that there are other factors to consider, such as risks and management.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc. (AAPL). None of the previous predictions contain information about Apple's performance or stock movements. Since the headline does not directly relate to Apple Inc., it is unlikely to trigger any significant stock price movement. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement is low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about billionaire Steven Cohen selling his shares in Apple Inc. indicates a significant bearish sentiment that is likely to impact investor confidence negatively. Prominent investors often influence market behavior, and such a sell-off might lead to other investors questioning their positions in AAPL. Additionally, existing concerns about declining iPhone sales, potential legal issues, and high valuation add to the negative outlook. Despite some analysts suggesting potential undervaluation and growth opportunities, the immediate context implies a higher likelihood of a price decline due to the overall bearish sentiment reflected in previous predictions. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, aligning with the prevailing opinions and technical indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a significantly negative outlook for Apple. Steven Cohen's decision to sell his stake, especially his former second-largest holding, serves as a major bearish indicator, overshadowing the positive performance of Axon. The issues explicitly mentioned, such as declining iPhone sales in China, possible revenue losses due to the Google legal battle, the disappointing reception of new AI features, and the high valuation driven by multiple expansion more than earnings, create a concerning outlook for Apple. While there's a 'Double Down' advocacy by the Motley Fool, it carries less weight than the real specific challenges. Previous predictions lean heavily towards a falling stock price. Therefore, considering all the factors, the chance that Apple's stock price will fall is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q4 earnings. While the overall earnings season is positive, Apple's stock has underperformed due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, while bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone, anticipating AI partnerships.  Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve.  Previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting uncertainty.  The consensus leans slightly bearish, but the upcoming earnings report is crucial. A beat could trigger a rise; a miss, a fall. The overall positive earnings season provides some counterbalance to the Apple-specific concerns. Considering the mixed signals and the importance of the earnings announcement, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging a significant chance of a price rise if the earnings are positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with shares down 11% year-to-date and nearing a critical 200-day moving average support level.

The concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal challenges with Google, and an expensive valuation based on multiple expansion rather than earnings growth also contribute to the negative outlook. However, some models consider the potential for undervaluation and future growth opportunities, which could mitigate the negative impact. Considering these aspects, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news analyzes Apple Inc.'s valuation using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, suggesting the company is undervalued by 20% with an estimated fair value of $279 compared to its current share price of $223. The DCF model estimates future cash flows and discounts them to their present value, indicating potential for growth. However, valuations are imprecise and do not account for all factors that could influence stock price, such as cyclicality of the industry or future capital requirements. Despite this, the overall analysis leans towards a bullish outlook due to the perceived undervaluation and expected growth in future cash flows. Considering the mixed but generally positive sentiment from the DCF analysis and the potential for undervaluation, it's reasonable to conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc. (AAPL). None of the previous predictions contain information about Apple's performance or stock movements. Since the headline does not directly relate to Apple Inc., it is unlikely to trigger any significant stock price movement. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement is low.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about billionaire Steven Cohen selling his shares in Apple Inc. is likely to signal negative sentiment in the market, as prominent investors' actions can heavily influence investor confidence. Combined with existing concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, potential legal challenges, and high valuations based on earnings growth expectations, the market may react unfavorably to this news. Although there are discussions around Apple's potential undervaluation and future growth prospects, the immediate impact of a notable investor sell-off from a high-profile investor like Cohen suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.18, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.82, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds and the current news leans heavily negative for Apple (AAPL). Steven Cohen selling his stake, especially given its former significance in his portfolio, is a major bearish sign. The reasons cited -- declining iPhone sales in China, potential service revenue loss due to the Google situation, lackluster reception of AI features, and a high, earnings-growth-detached valuation -- all contribute to a concerning picture. A lone 'Double Down' recommendation from the Motley Fool isn't enough to offset these challenges. Prior rounds also mostly anticipated a stock decline. I'm lowering the probability of a price increase ever so slightly. The Axon news is not material to the Apple prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the broader market shows positive Q4 earnings, Apple's stock has lagged due to China concerns and AI strategy questions.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, while bulls see the negativity as overdone, anticipating AI partnerships. Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve.  Previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting uncertainty. The upcoming earnings report is crucial: a positive surprise could drive a price increase; a negative surprise, a price decrease.  The overall positive earnings season provides some counterbalance to the Apple-specific concerns. Considering these mixed signals and the importance of the earnings report, I assign a slightly higher probability of a price fall, acknowledging a significant chance of a rise if earnings are positive.  The persistent bearish sentiment regarding China and AI, coupled with the sell-off by prominent investors, weighs heavily on the overall outlook, even when considering potential for positive news on AI partnerships. The previous predictions consistently showing a higher probability of a price fall support this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.
