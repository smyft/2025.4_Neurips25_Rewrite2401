(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that a prominent investor, Steven Cohen, has decided to sell his shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) in favor of investing in another stock that has shown significant growth. This could be interpreted negatively by the market, as it may suggest a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects. Investor sentiment can be heavily influenced by high-profile sell-offs, potentially leading to increased selling pressure on AAPL stock. However, it is important to consider that Cohen's actions might also prompt other investors to re-evaluate their positions, and if there are no additional negative factors affecting Apple, the market may stabilize or even see a rise due to other ongoing positive developments surrounding the company. Overall, these aspects result in a stronger probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a prominent hedge fund manager (Steven Cohen) sold his stake, signaling a lack of confidence. The article cites headwinds, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal challenges with Google, and the perceived failure of AI features to drive an upgrade cycle. The expensive valuation (33x earnings) based primarily on multiple expansion rather than earnings growth is also concerning. All these are factors that suggest that the stock prices falling is reasonably significant. On the other hand, the article on The Motley Fool is indicating buying Apple Stocks. I would prioritize the first part of the article which indicates that Apple's Stock price falling given my interpretation of the data.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q4 earnings. While the overall earnings season is showing positive results, Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China operations and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downward. However, bullish sentiment suggests this negativity might be overdone, pointing to potential partnerships with Chinese AI companies as a mitigating factor.  The article highlights that Apple's net margins are expected to modestly increase, unlike Tesla's slight decrease.  Considering the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted. The probability of a price rise is lower due to the prevailing bearish sentiment and concerns around China and AI strategy, while the probability of a fall is higher but not overwhelmingly so, given the potential for positive news about AI partnerships.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with shares plummeting by 11% and nearing a critical 200-day moving average support level. Analysts suggest that breaching this level could signal further losses, and there is a loss of confidence among traders regarding the uptrend. Despite some optimism from analysts about future growth potential in services and wearables, the immediate sentiment appears negative due to the stock's weak performance and the broader market rally without Apple's participation. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event that could influence the stock's direction, but the current technical indicators and market sentiment suggest a higher probability of a continued decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. Such a rating is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. The headline also questions whether it is time to sell the stock, further implying a potential downside. Given this negative sentiment, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article suggests that Apple Inc. is undervalued by 20% based on the discounted cash flow model, with an estimated fair value of $279. The company's future cash flows are expected to grow, and the current share price of $223 is lower than the estimated fair value. This indicates a potential opportunity for investors. However, the article also notes that valuation is only one aspect of building an investment thesis and that there are other factors to consider, such as risks and management. Given the information provided, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to the perceived undervaluation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is no direct information in the given headline that indicates any impact on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his shares in Apple (AAPL) and has chosen to invest in a lesser-known AI stock, which could be interpreted negatively by the market. Such actions by prominent investors often lead to reduced confidence in the company and may cause other investors to follow suit, leading to a decline in the stock price. Additionally, there are existing concerns about declining iPhone sales, legal challenges, and an expensive valuation based on earnings growth. Despite some bullish sentiment from analysts suggesting potential undervaluation and future growth opportunities, the immediate impact of a significant sell-off from a high-profile investor generally leans towards a bearish outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but ultimately negative outlook for Apple. Steven Cohen selling his stake, a former second-largest holding, is a significant bearish signal despite the delayed reporting of the move. The specific reasons cited for concern \u2013 declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal issues with Google, and a lack of market excitement around new AI features \u2013 paint a concerning picture. The expensive valuation is another red flag, bolstered more by multiple expansion than earnings growth. While there's an opposing \"double down\" advertisement in the same article, the specific and numerous challenges outlined for Apple outweigh the general bullish marketing. The previous round had most models predicting falling stock price. Considering this information, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\n\nIt is important to note that Axon's positive performance does little to offset the negative press surrounding Apple. While Cohen's purchase of Axon is noteworthy, it doesn't directly influence Apple's stock, especially given the small relative size of the purchase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While the broader market and many S&P 500 companies are showing strong Q4 earnings, Apple's stock has lagged, driven by concerns about its performance in China and its AI strategy.  Analysts are divided, with some predicting a guidance cut while others believe the current bearish sentiment is overdone, pointing to potential future partnerships with Chinese AI companies.  Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve, a positive sign.  Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance. Considering the mixed signals and the uncertainty around the impact of China and AI concerns on Apple's near-term performance, I've assigned a probability slightly higher for a stock price fall.  The upcoming earnings report is the primary factor influencing the probabilities. If the earnings beat expectations, the stock is likely to rise and vice versa. The overall earnings season seems positive, giving a slight edge to the possibility of exceeding earnings expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) facing significant challenges in 2025, with its stock down 11% year-to-date, marking its worst start since 2008. The stock is nearing the 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level, which if breached, could signal further declines. Analysts express concerns about losing confidence in the uptrend, and while some remain optimistic about growth in services and wearables, the immediate sentiment is negative. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is pivotal, but current technical indicators and market sentiment suggest a higher probability of continued decline. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models favoring a 0.7 probability of a fall and 0.3 of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. This rating, combined with the analyst's question of whether it is time to sell the stock, implies a negative outlook. Furthermore, the previous predictions from various models show a prevailing bearish sentiment, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. The average prediction of stock price falling from previous models is around 0.67, while the average prediction of stock price rising is around 0.33. Considering these aspects, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is undervalued by 20% based on the discounted cash flow model, with an estimated fair value of $279. The company's future cash flows are expected to grow, and the current share price of $223 is lower than the estimated fair value. This indicates a potential opportunity for investors. Given the information provided, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to the perceived undervaluation. Additionally, the SWOT analysis highlights the company's strengths, such as debt being well covered by earnings and cash flows, and opportunities, such as annual earnings forecast to grow for the next 3 years. However, the article also notes that valuation is only one aspect of building an investment thesis and that there are other factors to consider, such as risks and management.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc. (AAPL). None of the previous predictions contain information about Apple's performance or stock movements. Since the headline does not directly relate to Apple Inc., it is unlikely to trigger any significant stock price movement. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement is low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about billionaire Steven Cohen selling his shares in Apple Inc. indicates a significant bearish sentiment that is likely to impact investor confidence negatively. Prominent investors often influence market behavior, and such a sell-off might lead to other investors questioning their positions in AAPL. Additionally, existing concerns about declining iPhone sales, potential legal issues, and high valuation add to the negative outlook. Despite some analysts suggesting potential undervaluation and growth opportunities, the immediate context implies a higher likelihood of a price decline due to the overall bearish sentiment reflected in previous predictions. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, aligning with the prevailing opinions and technical indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a significantly negative outlook for Apple. Steven Cohen's decision to sell his stake, especially his former second-largest holding, serves as a major bearish indicator, overshadowing the positive performance of Axon. The issues explicitly mentioned, such as declining iPhone sales in China, possible revenue losses due to the Google legal battle, the disappointing reception of new AI features, and the high valuation driven by multiple expansion more than earnings, create a concerning outlook for Apple. While there's a 'Double Down' advocacy by the Motley Fool, it carries less weight than the real specific challenges. Previous predictions lean heavily towards a falling stock price. Therefore, considering all the factors, the chance that Apple's stock price will fall is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q4 earnings. While the overall earnings season is positive, Apple's stock has underperformed due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, while bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone, anticipating AI partnerships.  Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve.  Previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting uncertainty.  The consensus leans slightly bearish, but the upcoming earnings report is crucial. A beat could trigger a rise; a miss, a fall. The overall positive earnings season provides some counterbalance to the Apple-specific concerns. Considering the mixed signals and the importance of the earnings announcement, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging a significant chance of a price rise if the earnings are positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.

Considering these aspects, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news analyzes Apple Inc.'s valuation using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, suggesting the company is undervalued by 20% with an estimated fair value of $279 compared to its current share price of $223. The DCF model estimates future cash flows and discounts them to their present value, indicating potential for growth. However, valuations are imprecise and do not account for all factors that could influence stock price, such as cyclicality of the industry or future capital requirements. Despite this, the overall analysis leans towards a bullish outlook due to the perceived undervaluation and expected growth in future cash flows. Considering the mixed but generally positive sentiment from the DCF analysis and the potential for undervaluation, it's reasonable to conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc.

Combined with existing concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, potential legal challenges, and high valuations based on earnings growth expectations, the market may react unfavorably to this news. Although there are discussions around Apple's potential undervaluation and future growth prospects, the immediate impact of a notable investor sell-off from a high-profile investor like Cohen suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.18, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.82, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds and the current news leans heavily negative for Apple (AAPL). Steven Cohen selling his stake, especially given its former significance in his portfolio, is a major bearish sign. The reasons cited -- declining iPhone sales in China, potential service revenue loss due to the Google situation, lackluster reception of AI features, and a high, earnings-growth-detached valuation -- all contribute to a concerning picture. A lone 'Double Down' recommendation from the Motley Fool isn't enough to offset these challenges. Prior rounds also mostly anticipated a stock decline. I'm lowering the probability of a price increase ever so slightly. The Axon news is not material to the Apple prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the broader market shows positive Q4 earnings, Apple's stock has lagged due to China concerns and AI strategy questions.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, while bulls see the negativity as overdone, anticipating AI partnerships. Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve.  Previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting uncertainty. The upcoming earnings report is crucial: a positive surprise could drive a price increase; a negative surprise, a price decrease.  The overall positive earnings season provides some counterbalance to the Apple-specific concerns. Considering these mixed signals and the importance of the earnings report, I assign a slightly higher probability of a price fall, acknowledging a significant chance of a rise if earnings are positive.  The persistent bearish sentiment regarding China and AI, coupled with the sell-off by prominent investors, weighs heavily on the overall outlook, even when considering potential for positive news on AI partnerships. The previous predictions consistently showing a higher probability of a price fall support this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.

This indicates a potential opportunity for investors. The SWOT analysis highlights the company's strengths, such as debt being well covered by earnings and cash flows, and opportunities, such as annual earnings forecast to grow for the next 3 years. However, the article also notes that valuation is only one aspect of building an investment thesis and that there are other factors to consider, such as risks and management.
