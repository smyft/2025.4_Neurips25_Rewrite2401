      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\nNews Content: How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline pertains specifically to investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, which is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations or performance. Since the information provided doesn't have any significant implications for Apple's stock performance, it is unlikely to cause major movements in either direction. Hence, the probabilities of price movement are quite balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a 20% undervaluation based on a DCF analysis. While DCF models have limitations, this analysis, alongside positive earnings growth forecasts for the next 3 years, create a positive sentiment. The report also mentions Apple's debt being well covered and identifies the company as a good value based on P/E ratio and fair value. However, the slower earnings growth forecast compared to the overall American market, and the general caution advised against over-reliance on DCF, tempers exuberance. Although the article highlights both upsides and downsides regarding the stock, I believe that the estimated undervaluation will nudge investors to action which will cause the price to move upward.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal challenges, and the lack of a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI features.  These factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, leadership in several markets, and expected earnings growth (though at an expensive valuation) provide some counterbalance.  The article concludes with a strong bearish sentiment advising investors to avoid the stock.  In contrast, the news is bullish for Axon Enterprise, highlighting strong financial results, a large addressable market, and the successful integration of AI features. Although its valuation is high, the continued exceeding of earnings expectations suggests potential for further growth, particularly for risk-tolerant, long-term investors. The analysis focuses primarily on Apple due to the explicit recommendation to avoid its stock, while Axon is presented as a riskier, more speculative investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's stock price could be influenced by its earnings report, with AI being a central theme, potentially impacting investor sentiment positively if the results exceed expectations. Conversely, any disappointment in earnings or negative guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also a critical factor; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could buoy the market, while hawkish signals might pressure tech stocks. Given Apple's strong position and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome due to potential positive earnings surprises and favorable Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple bulls believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the stable estimates for the December quarter, it's likely that Apple's stock price will have a relatively muted reaction to the earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen is selling his Apple stock and investing in a different company, specifically an AI stock that has seen significant gains, may indicate a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects or a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies. However, it's also important to consider that individual investor actions, even those of high-profile billionaires, do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors including its financial performance, product innovation, market demand, and overall economic conditions. Given this context, while the news might have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to perceived lack of confidence from a prominent investor, the long-term trajectory of the company is more closely tied to its fundamental strengths and the overall tech industry trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline primarily discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not have a direct correlation to Apple's operational performance or specific news about the company. Given this lack of direct relevance, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited. It seems that analysts have a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's outlook, mostly weighing on external factors unrelated to Apple itself. As such, I estimate a balanced probability, slightly favoring a higher chance for stock price rising due to the broader market sentiment that might benefit from ETF investments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a valuation analysis suggesting Apple is undervalued by 20%. This is a positive signal. The DCF analysis, while acknowledged to have limitations, projects future cash flows and arrives at a fair value estimate higher than the current share price. Analyst price target is also lower but confirms a positive outlook. The article also highlights earnings growing in the next 3 years. \n\nConsidering previous rounds' predictions:\n\nRound 0 shows a range of opinions. Some models leaned bearish due to external economic news and concerns, while others were more bullish due to the undervaluation. There is a diversity of opinions so it is important to rely on the current news.\n\nTaking all of this together, the 'undervaluation' narrative, even with caveats, is typically a catalyst for positive price movement, albeit tempered by general market caution and the inherent uncertainty of DCF valuations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to remember this action occurred in the third quarter, and the market may have already digested this information. The article highlights several significant headwinds: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue from the Google/Safari lawsuit, and the lackluster response to Apple's AI features.  These factors significantly weigh toward a price fall.  Counterbalancing these are Apple's strong brand, market leadership, and expected earnings growth (albeit at a high valuation).  The article's conclusion strongly advises against investing in Apple, further reinforcing the negative outlook.  However, the fact that this is older news, and Apple's fundamentals remain relatively strong, suggests the impact might be less dramatic than the immediate reaction might suggest.  Considering the previous predictions and the mixed nature of the information, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the weight of the negative factors outlined and the bearish conclusion of the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's stock price could be influenced by its earnings report, with AI being a central theme, potentially impacting investor sentiment positively if the results exceed expectations. Conversely, any disappointment in earnings or negative guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also a critical factor; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could buoy the market, while hawkish signals might pressure tech stocks. Given Apple's strong position and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome due to potential positive earnings surprises and favorable Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look' discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple bulls believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the stable estimates for the December quarter, it's likely that Apple's stock price will have a relatively muted reaction to the earnings report. However, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly negative due to the mentioned headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen is selling his Apple stock and investing in a little-known AI stock may indicate a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies, potentially leading to a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, individual investor actions do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the news' potential short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price, I estimated the probabilities based on the balance of these factors. The majority of the predictions from other models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, which aligns with the potential negative impact of Steven Cohen's actions on investor confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential 20% undervaluation of Apple Inc. based on a DCF model, with a fair value estimate of US$279 as opposed to its current share price of US$223. This suggests that the stock is currently undervalued, which typically triggers increased buying interest. The news also highlights positive aspects such as earnings growth forecast, a good value ratio, and debt coverage, adding to the optimism. However, it also mentions potential headwinds like slower earnings growth compared to the broader market and potential legal challenges affecting services revenue. Considering the variety of perspectives from previous predictions and noting some cautionary statements, a balanced assessment leads to a slightly skewed expectation towards a rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
