(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline pertains specifically to investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, which is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations or performance. Since the information provided doesn't have any significant implications for Apple's stock performance, it is unlikely to cause major movements in either direction. Hence, the probabilities of price movement are quite balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a 20% undervaluation based on a DCF analysis. While DCF models have limitations, this analysis, alongside positive earnings growth forecasts for the next 3 years, create a positive sentiment. The report also mentions Apple's debt being well covered and identifies the company as a good value based on P/E ratio and fair value. However, the slower earnings growth forecast compared to the overall American market, and the general caution advised against over-reliance on DCF, tempers exuberance. Although the article highlights both upsides and downsides regarding the stock, I believe that the estimated undervaluation will nudge investors to action which will cause the price to move upward.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal challenges, and the lack of a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI features.  These factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, leadership in several markets, and expected earnings growth (though at an expensive valuation) provide some counterbalance.  The article concludes with a strong bearish sentiment advising investors to avoid the stock.  In contrast, the news is bullish for Axon Enterprise, highlighting strong financial results, a large addressable market, and the successful integration of AI features. Although its valuation is high, the continued exceeding of earnings expectations suggests potential for further growth, particularly for risk-tolerant, long-term investors. The analysis focuses primarily on Apple due to the explicit recommendation to avoid its stock, while Axon is presented as a riskier, more speculative investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's stock price could be influenced by its earnings report, with AI being a central theme, potentially impacting investor sentiment positively if the results exceed expectations. Conversely, any disappointment in earnings or negative guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also a critical factor; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could buoy the market, while hawkish signals might pressure tech stocks. Given Apple's strong position and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome due to potential positive earnings surprises and favorable Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple bulls believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the stable estimates for the December quarter, it's likely that Apple's stock price will have a relatively muted reaction to the earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen is selling his Apple stock and investing in a different company, specifically an AI stock that has seen significant gains, may indicate a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects or a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies. However, it's also important to consider that individual investor actions, even those of high-profile billionaires, do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors including its financial performance, product innovation, market demand, and overall economic conditions. Given this context, while the news might have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to perceived lack of confidence from a prominent investor, the long-term trajectory of the company is more closely tied to its fundamental strengths and the overall tech industry trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline primarily discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not have a direct correlation to Apple's operational performance or specific news about the company. Given this lack of direct relevance, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited. It seems that analysts have a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's outlook, mostly weighing on external factors unrelated to Apple itself. As such, I estimate a balanced probability, slightly favoring a higher chance for stock price rising due to the broader market sentiment that might benefit from ETF investments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a valuation analysis suggesting Apple is undervalued by 20%. This is a positive signal. The DCF analysis, while acknowledged to have limitations, projects future cash flows and arrives at a fair value estimate higher than the current share price. Analyst price target is also lower but confirms a positive outlook. The article also highlights earnings growing in the next 3 years. \n\nConsidering previous rounds' predictions:\n\nRound 0 shows a range of opinions. Some models leaned bearish due to external economic news and concerns, while others were more bullish due to the undervaluation. There is a diversity of opinions so it is important to rely on the current news.\n\nTaking all of this together, the 'undervaluation' narrative, even with caveats, is typically a catalyst for positive price movement, albeit tempered by general market caution and the inherent uncertainty of DCF valuations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to remember this action occurred in the third quarter, and the market may have already digested this information. The article highlights several significant headwinds: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue from the Google/Safari lawsuit, and the lackluster response to Apple's AI features.  These factors significantly weigh toward a price fall.  Counterbalancing these are Apple's strong brand, market leadership, and expected earnings growth (albeit at a high valuation).  The article's conclusion strongly advises against investing in Apple, further reinforcing the negative outlook.  However, the fact that this is older news, and Apple's fundamentals remain relatively strong, suggests the impact might be less dramatic than the immediate reaction might suggest.  Considering the previous predictions and the mixed nature of the information, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the weight of the negative factors outlined and the bearish conclusion of the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's stock price could be influenced by its earnings report, with AI being a central theme, potentially impacting investor sentiment positively if the results exceed expectations. Conversely, any disappointment in earnings or negative guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also a critical factor; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could buoy the market, while hawkish signals might pressure tech stocks. Given Apple's strong position and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome due to potential positive earnings surprises and favorable Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look' discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple bulls believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the stable estimates for the December quarter, it's likely that Apple's stock price will have a relatively muted reaction to the earnings report. However, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly negative due to the mentioned headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen is selling his Apple stock and investing in a little-known AI stock may indicate a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies, potentially leading to a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, individual investor actions do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the news' potential short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price, I estimated the probabilities based on the balance of these factors. The majority of the predictions from other models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, which aligns with the potential negative impact of Steven Cohen's actions on investor confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential 20% undervaluation of Apple Inc. based on a DCF model, with a fair value estimate of US$279 as opposed to its current share price of US$223. This suggests that the stock is currently undervalued, which typically triggers increased buying interest. The news also highlights positive aspects such as earnings growth forecast, a good value ratio, and debt coverage, adding to the optimism. However, it also mentions potential headwinds like slower earnings growth compared to the broader market and potential legal challenges affecting services revenue. Considering the variety of perspectives from previous predictions and noting some cautionary statements, a balanced assessment leads to a slightly skewed expectation towards a rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
