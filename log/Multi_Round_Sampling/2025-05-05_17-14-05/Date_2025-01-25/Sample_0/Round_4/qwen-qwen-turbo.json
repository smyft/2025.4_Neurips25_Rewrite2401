(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline pertains specifically to investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, which is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations or performance. Since the information provided doesn't have any significant implications for Apple's stock performance, it is unlikely to cause major movements in either direction. Hence, the probabilities of price movement are quite balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a 20% undervaluation based on a DCF analysis. While DCF models have limitations, this analysis, alongside positive earnings growth forecasts for the next 3 years, create a positive sentiment. The report also mentions Apple's debt being well covered and identifies the company as a good value based on P/E ratio and fair value. However, the slower earnings growth forecast compared to the overall American market, and the general caution advised against over-reliance on DCF, tempers exuberance. Although the article highlights both upsides and downsides regarding the stock, I believe that the estimated undervaluation will nudge investors to action which will cause the price to move upward.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal challenges, and the lack of a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI features.  These factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, leadership in several markets, and expected earnings growth (though at an expensive valuation) provide some counterbalance.  The article concludes with a strong bearish sentiment advising investors to avoid the stock.  In contrast, the news is bullish for Axon Enterprise, highlighting strong financial results, a large addressable market, and the successful integration of AI features. Although its valuation is high, the continued exceeding of earnings expectations suggests potential for further growth, particularly for risk-tolerant, long-term investors. The analysis focuses primarily on Apple due to the explicit recommendation to avoid its stock, while Axon is presented as a riskier, more speculative investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's stock price could be influenced by its earnings report, with AI being a central theme, potentially impacting investor sentiment positively if the results exceed expectations. Conversely, any disappointment in earnings or negative guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also a critical factor; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could buoy the market, while hawkish signals might pressure tech stocks. Given Apple's strong position and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome due to potential positive earnings surprises and favorable Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple bulls believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the stable estimates for the December quarter, it's likely that Apple's stock price will have a relatively muted reaction to the earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen is selling his Apple stock and investing in a different company, specifically an AI stock that has seen significant gains, may indicate a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects or a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies. However, it's also important to consider that individual investor actions, even those of high-profile billionaires, do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors including its financial performance, product innovation, market demand, and overall economic conditions. Given this context, while the news might have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to perceived lack of confidence from a prominent investor, the long-term trajectory of the company is more closely tied to its fundamental strengths and the overall tech industry trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline primarily discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not have a direct correlation to Apple's operational performance or specific news about the company. Given this lack of direct relevance, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited. It seems that analysts have a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's outlook, mostly weighing on external factors unrelated to Apple itself. As such, I estimate a balanced probability, slightly favoring a higher chance for stock price rising due to the broader market sentiment that might benefit from ETF investments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a valuation analysis suggesting Apple is undervalued by 20%. This is a positive signal. The DCF analysis, while acknowledged to have limitations, projects future cash flows and arrives at a fair value estimate higher than the current share price. Analyst price target is also lower but confirms a positive outlook. The article also highlights earnings growing in the next 3 years. \n\nConsidering previous rounds' predictions:\n\nRound 0 shows a range of opinions. Some models leaned bearish due to external economic news and concerns, while others were more bullish due to the undervaluation. There is a diversity of opinions so it is important to rely on the current news.\n\nTaking all of this together, the 'undervaluation' narrative, even with caveats, is typically a catalyst for positive price movement, albeit tempered by general market caution and the inherent uncertainty of DCF valuations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to remember this action occurred in the third quarter, and the market may have already digested this information. The article highlights several significant headwinds: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue from the Google/Safari lawsuit, and the lackluster response to Apple's AI features.  These factors significantly weigh toward a price fall.  Counterbalancing these are Apple's strong brand, market leadership, and expected earnings growth (albeit at a high valuation).  The article's conclusion strongly advises against investing in Apple, further reinforcing the negative outlook.  However, the fact that this is older news, and Apple's fundamentals remain relatively strong, suggests the impact might be less dramatic than the immediate reaction might suggest.  Considering the previous predictions and the mixed nature of the information, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the weight of the negative factors outlined and the bearish conclusion of the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc.

Given Apple's strong position and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome due to potential positive earnings surprises and favorable Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look' discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple bulls believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months.

Given the mixed sentiment and the stable estimates for the December quarter, it's likely that Apple's stock price will have a relatively muted reaction to the earnings report. However, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly negative due to the mentioned headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen is selling his Apple stock and investing in a little-known AI stock may indicate a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies, potentially leading to a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, individual investor actions do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the news' potential short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price, I estimated the probabilities based on the balance of these factors. The majority of the predictions from other models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, which aligns with the potential negative impact of Steven Cohen's actions on investor confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential 20% undervaluation of Apple Inc. based on a DCF model, with a fair value estimate of US$279 as opposed to its current share price of US$223. This suggests that the stock is currently undervalued, which typically triggers increased buying interest. The news also highlights positive aspects such as earnings growth forecast, a good value ratio, and debt coverage, adding to the optimism. However, it also mentions potential headwinds like slower earnings growth compared to the broader market and potential legal challenges affecting services revenue. Considering the variety of perspectives from previous predictions and noting some cautionary statements, a balanced assessment leads to a slightly skewed expectation towards a rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) and its investment strategies, which do not directly relate to Apple's performance or market position. Therefore, the implications of this news on Apple's stock price are limited and may not directly influence it. However, the previous predictions indicate mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's stock due to various external factors, including valuation concerns and general market conditions. While some believe there is undervaluation that might lead to positive sentiment, the overall uncertainty seen in prior assessments suggests a balanced probability. Thus, I estimate equal chances for both a rise and a fall in Apple's stock price due to the lack of directly relevant information in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a 20% undervaluation of Apple based on a DCF model and analysts' estimates, suggesting a potential upside. The analysis also points to forecasted earnings growth. However, it also acknowledges slower growth compared to the overall market and caveats related to the DCF model and potential risks. Considering that previous rounds showed mixed sentiments but with some models leaning towards a bearish outlook due to external factors, I believe that in this turn the undervaluation narrative will cause the stock price to rise, albeit tempered by downside risks and that the market may have already priced in those other factors. However the undervaluation is a stong signal to nudge investors into action.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to remember this action occurred in the third quarter, and the market may have already digested this information.

These factors weigh heavily toward a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, market leadership, and expected earnings growth (albeit at a high valuation) offer some counterbalance. The article's bearish conclusion adds to the negative sentiment.  Considering previous predictions which show a wide range of opinions and the mixed nature of the information, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the weight of the negative factors and the bearish conclusion.  The fact that much of this is older news, and Apple's fundamentals remain relatively strong, tempers the prediction, preventing it from being overwhelmingly bearish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights two major events that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price: the upcoming Big Tech earnings (including Apple) and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's earnings report, with AI as a central theme, could positively influence investor sentiment if results exceed expectations, while any disappointment could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also critical, as a dovish stance might buoy the market, whereas hawkish signals could pressure tech stocks. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, with some models leaning bullish due to potential positive earnings and others bearish due to external factors like China sales and AI strategy concerns. Considering these factors, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome, given Apple's strong position and potential for favorable earnings and Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc.

This action may indicate a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies and potentially lead to a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, individual investor actions do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, the potential short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to Steven Cohen's actions, and the overall sentiment from previous rounds, I estimated the probabilities based on the balance of these factors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s estimated fair value at $279 based on a DCF analysis, indicating a potential 20% undervaluation based on the current share price of $223. This is a positive indicator that could potentially trigger positive price movements. While the DCF analysis comes with inherent uncertainties and limitations, the undervaluation and potential for positive earnings growth create a positive sentiment. However, other factors such as slower earnings growth compared to the broader market and potential headwinds from legal challenges remain concerns. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning bullish due to undervaluation and others more bearish due to various headwinds.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline primarily discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which has no direct impact on Apple Inc.'s operations. The previous predictions reflect a mix of sentiments towards Apple's stock, with some indicating a potential undervaluation and growth prospects, while others highlight headwinds such as declining iPhone sales and market sentiment influenced by external factors. Given this ambiguity and the lack of immediate relevance of the news to Apple's specific performance, it leads to a balanced outlook with probabilities slightly favoring a rise stemming from the potential undervaluation narrative and general market behavior. However, caution from various bearish sentiments keeps the probabilities relatively even.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a 20% undervaluation of Apple based on a DCF model. While DCF has limitations, this suggests potential upside. Earnings growth is also forecast. The article also points to strong debt coverage. Previous rounds showed mixed sentiments due to external factors, but the persistent 'undervaluation' narrative should nudge investors into action, even if tempered by general market caution. A slight bump in rise probability compared to the last round is thus justified.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, but it's crucial to remember this happened in Q3, and the market may have already adjusted.  Significant headwinds exist: declining iPhone sales in China, potential Google/Safari lawsuit revenue loss, and underwhelming AI feature adoption. These factors strongly suggest a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, market leadership, and expected earnings growth (despite a high valuation) offer some counterbalance. The article's bearish conclusion reinforces the negative sentiment. Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, from balanced to strongly bearish. Considering the weight of negative factors and the overall bearish sentiment, a higher probability of a price fall is assigned. The fact that much of this is older news and Apple's fundamentals remain strong mitigates the prediction, preventing it from being overwhelmingly bearish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc.
