      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline pertains specifically to investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, which is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations or performance. Since the information provided doesn't have any significant implications for Apple's stock performance, it is unlikely to cause major movements in either direction. Hence, the probabilities of price movement are quite balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a 20% undervaluation based on a DCF analysis. While DCF models have limitations, this analysis, alongside positive earnings growth forecasts for the next 3 years, create a positive sentiment. The report also mentions Apple's debt being well covered and identifies the company as a good value based on P/E ratio and fair value. However, the slower earnings growth forecast compared to the overall American market, and the general caution advised against over-reliance on DCF, tempers exuberance. Although the article highlights both upsides and downsides regarding the stock, I believe that the estimated undervaluation will nudge investors to action which will cause the price to move upward.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds facing Apple: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to legal challenges, and the lack of a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI features.  These factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, leadership in several markets, and expected earnings growth (though at an expensive valuation) provide some counterbalance.  The article concludes with a strong bearish sentiment advising investors to avoid the stock.  In contrast, the news is bullish for Axon Enterprise, highlighting strong financial results, a large addressable market, and the successful integration of AI features. Although its valuation is high, the continued exceeding of earnings expectations suggests potential for further growth, particularly for risk-tolerant, long-term investors. The analysis focuses primarily on Apple due to the explicit recommendation to avoid its stock, while Axon is presented as a riskier, more speculative investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's stock price could be influenced by its earnings report, with AI being a central theme, potentially impacting investor sentiment positively if the results exceed expectations. Conversely, any disappointment in earnings or negative guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also a critical factor; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could buoy the market, while hawkish signals might pressure tech stocks. Given Apple's strong position and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome due to potential positive earnings surprises and favorable Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple bulls believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the stable estimates for the December quarter, it's likely that Apple's stock price will have a relatively muted reaction to the earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen is selling his Apple stock and investing in a different company, specifically an AI stock that has seen significant gains, may indicate a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects or a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies. However, it's also important to consider that individual investor actions, even those of high-profile billionaires, do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors including its financial performance, product innovation, market demand, and overall economic conditions. Given this context, while the news might have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to perceived lack of confidence from a prominent investor, the long-term trajectory of the company is more closely tied to its fundamental strengths and the overall tech industry trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline primarily discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not have a direct correlation to Apple's operational performance or specific news about the company. Given this lack of direct relevance, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited. It seems that analysts have a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's outlook, mostly weighing on external factors unrelated to Apple itself. As such, I estimate a balanced probability, slightly favoring a higher chance for stock price rising due to the broader market sentiment that might benefit from ETF investments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a valuation analysis suggesting Apple is undervalued by 20%. This is a positive signal. The DCF analysis, while acknowledged to have limitations, projects future cash flows and arrives at a fair value estimate higher than the current share price. Analyst price target is also lower but confirms a positive outlook. The article also highlights earnings growing in the next 3 years. \n\nConsidering previous rounds' predictions:\n\nRound 0 shows a range of opinions. Some models leaned bearish due to external economic news and concerns, while others were more bullish due to the undervaluation. There is a diversity of opinions so it is important to rely on the current news.\n\nTaking all of this together, the 'undervaluation' narrative, even with caveats, is typically a catalyst for positive price movement, albeit tempered by general market caution and the inherent uncertainty of DCF valuations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to remember this action occurred in the third quarter, and the market may have already digested this information. The article highlights several significant headwinds: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue from the Google/Safari lawsuit, and the lackluster response to Apple's AI features.  These factors significantly weigh toward a price fall.  Counterbalancing these are Apple's strong brand, market leadership, and expected earnings growth (albeit at a high valuation).  The article's conclusion strongly advises against investing in Apple, further reinforcing the negative outlook.  However, the fact that this is older news, and Apple's fundamentals remain relatively strong, suggests the impact might be less dramatic than the immediate reaction might suggest.  Considering the previous predictions and the mixed nature of the information, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the weight of the negative factors outlined and the bearish conclusion of the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.

The Fed's rate decision is also a critical factor; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could buoy the market, while hawkish signals might pressure tech stocks. Given Apple's strong position and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome due to potential positive earnings surprises and favorable Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look' discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple bulls believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The article also mentions that estimates for the December quarter have been stable, but estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the stable estimates for the December quarter, it's likely that Apple's stock price will have a relatively muted reaction to the earnings report. However, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly negative due to the mentioned headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen is selling his Apple stock and investing in a little-known AI stock may indicate a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies, potentially leading to a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, individual investor actions do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the news' potential short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price, I estimated the probabilities based on the balance of these factors. The majority of the predictions from other models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, which aligns with the potential negative impact of Steven Cohen's actions on investor confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential 20% undervaluation of Apple Inc. based on a DCF model, with a fair value estimate of US$279 as opposed to its current share price of US$223. This suggests that the stock is currently undervalued, which typically triggers increased buying interest. The news also highlights positive aspects such as earnings growth forecast, a good value ratio, and debt coverage, adding to the optimism. However, it also mentions potential headwinds like slower earnings growth compared to the broader market and potential legal challenges affecting services revenue. Considering the variety of perspectives from previous predictions and noting some cautionary statements, a balanced assessment leads to a slightly skewed expectation towards a rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) and its investment strategies, which do not directly relate to Apple's performance or market position. Therefore, the implications of this news on Apple's stock price are limited and may not directly influence it. However, the previous predictions indicate mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's stock due to various external factors, including valuation concerns and general market conditions. While some believe there is undervaluation that might lead to positive sentiment, the overall uncertainty seen in prior assessments suggests a balanced probability. Thus, I estimate equal chances for both a rise and a fall in Apple's stock price due to the lack of directly relevant information in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a 20% undervaluation of Apple based on a DCF model and analysts' estimates, suggesting a potential upside. The analysis also points to forecasted earnings growth. However, it also acknowledges slower growth compared to the overall market and caveats related to the DCF model and potential risks. Considering that previous rounds showed mixed sentiments but with some models leaning towards a bearish outlook due to external factors, I believe that in this turn the undervaluation narrative will cause the stock price to rise, albeit tempered by downside risks and that the market may have already priced in those other factors. However the undervaluation is a stong signal to nudge investors into action.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen is a negative signal, it's crucial to remember this action occurred in the third quarter, and the market may have already digested this information.  The article highlights several significant headwinds: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue from the Google/Safari lawsuit, and the lackluster response to Apple's AI features.  These factors weigh heavily toward a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, market leadership, and expected earnings growth (albeit at a high valuation) offer some counterbalance. The article's bearish conclusion adds to the negative sentiment.  Considering previous predictions which show a wide range of opinions and the mixed nature of the information, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the weight of the negative factors and the bearish conclusion.  The fact that much of this is older news, and Apple's fundamentals remain relatively strong, tempers the prediction, preventing it from being overwhelmingly bearish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights two major events that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price: the upcoming Big Tech earnings (including Apple) and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's earnings report, with AI as a central theme, could positively influence investor sentiment if results exceed expectations, while any disappointment could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also critical, as a dovish stance might buoy the market, whereas hawkish signals could pressure tech stocks. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, with some models leaning bullish due to potential positive earnings and others bearish due to external factors like China sales and AI strategy concerns. Considering these factors, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive outcome, given Apple's strong position and potential for favorable earnings and Fed actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc.

This action may indicate a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies and potentially lead to a loss of confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, individual investor actions do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, the potential short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to Steven Cohen's actions, and the overall sentiment from previous rounds, I estimated the probabilities based on the balance of these factors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s estimated fair value at $279 based on a DCF analysis, indicating a potential 20% undervaluation based on the current share price of $223. This is a positive indicator that could potentially trigger positive price movements. While the DCF analysis comes with inherent uncertainties and limitations, the undervaluation and potential for positive earnings growth create a positive sentiment. However, other factors such as slower earnings growth compared to the broader market and potential headwinds from legal challenges remain concerns. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning bullish due to undervaluation and others more bearish due to various headwinds.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
