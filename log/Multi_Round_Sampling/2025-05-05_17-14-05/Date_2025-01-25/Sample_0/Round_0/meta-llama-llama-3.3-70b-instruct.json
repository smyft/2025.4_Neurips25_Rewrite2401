However, it's also important to consider that individual investor actions, even those of high-profile billionaires, do not necessarily dictate the overall market trend or a company's intrinsic value. Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors including its financial performance, product innovation, market demand, and overall economic conditions. Given this context, while the news might have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to perceived lack of confidence from a prominent investor, the long-term trajectory of the company is more closely tied to its fundamental strengths and the overall tech industry trends.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}"
