(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently experiencing significant stock price pressure, nearing a critical technical support level (the 200-day moving average) which, if breached, could trigger further losses and a loss of investor confidence. The stock has had one of its worst starts to the year in nearly two decades, while the overall market, represented by the S&P 500, has gained. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report might create uncertainty, leading to potential volatility. The mixed views on the potential for future growth in services and wearables may not sufficiently counteract the current downtrend. Overall, the analysis suggests a higher probability for a fall given the current market sentiment and technical indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader streaming landscape and its positive trend toward profitability in 2024. While it doesn't directly mention Apple's streaming service (Apple TV+), the overall positive sentiment in the industry is likely to have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock. The article highlights Netflix's success and explores challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent and significant streaming profits. Therefore, Apple may be indirectly affected by overall trends in the industry, but it is not a main focus considering this analysis. The news does not give a strong directional impetus for Apple's stock, considering, if any, Apple's streaming profits are likely to be small as compared to other ventures by Apple. Therefore, the probability for its stock rising is only slightly higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with its stock price nearing a critical 200-day moving average.  This technical indicator suggests potential further losses if breached, indicating a bearish sentiment among some analysts.  While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects citing potential growth in services and wearables, and upcoming earnings, the immediate near-term outlook appears negative due to the current market trends and the approaching critical support level. The fact that Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization further adds to the negative sentiment. The overall tone of the article leans towards a pessimistic outlook, although the upcoming earnings announcement could act as a catalyst for either a rise or fall depending on the results. However, given the current negative momentum and the proximity to a key technical support level, the probability of a fall is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggests a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools position it as a resilient stock in potential bear markets. The company's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further strengthens its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact the stock. The presence of hedge fund interest and the stock's inclusion in lists of best bear market stocks indicate underlying confidence, but macroeconomic risks and sector-specific challenges temper the optimism. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both outcomes are plausible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests that BT is concerned about Apple's growing market power in the smartphone industry, particularly with the rise of eSims. This could potentially lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of Apple, which might result in a negative impact on the company's stock price. On the other hand, Apple's dominant position in the market and its ability to adapt to changing technologies could mitigate the potential risks. Considering these points, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year. The stock approaching the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator, raises concerns among traders. Analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic view, believing in growth potential from services and wearables despite current softness in the iPhone cycle. Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is experiencing substantial downward pressure on its stock, nearing a critical 200-day moving average that could trigger further declines if breached. Analysts express concerns about a loss of investor confidence, especially after Apple's poor start to the year compared to the S&P 500's gains. While there is some optimism regarding future growth from services and wearables, the immediate sentiment remains negative due to broader market trends, reduced market capitalization relative to Nvidia, and the upcoming earnings report that may add to volatility. Weighing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the streaming industry's profitability shift. While positive for the industry overall, its direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect, as Apple TV+ is only part of Apple's diverse business. The article raises concerns about sustainable profits and subscriber churn, challenges applicable to Apple TV+ as well. Given the previous round's varied predictions and the lack of strong directional indication in this specific news, I modestly adjust my estimation. A rise is possible, but not guaranteed, as a generalized trend from others is rising while this article presents concerns for the overall market trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Negative factors include its worst start to the year since 2008, nearing a critical 200-day moving average, and being overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  Analyst sentiment is divided, with some expressing concern about the potential for further losses if the 200-day moving average is breached, while others remain optimistic about long-term growth potential in services and wearables. The upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard, potentially driving either a rise or fall depending on the results.  Considering the current negative momentum, proximity to a key technical support level, and the overall bearish sentiment reflected in several previous predictions (particularly the negative trend observed in the initial rounds), the probability of a fall appears higher than that of a rise in the short term. However, the potential for a positive earnings report and long-term growth prospects prevent this from being a definitively bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, it highlights Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools, which position it as a resilient stock in potential bear markets.

Additionally, the inclusion of Apple in lists of best bear market stocks indicates underlying confidence. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact the stock. Previous predictions also show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, influenced by technical indicators and market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses Apple's stock performance and the upcoming earnings reports of major companies, including Apple. Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas. Concerns about China's impact on Apple's business and its AI strategy have contributed to this decline. However, some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the coming months, which could potentially boost the stock. Given these mixed views and the current negative momentum, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests that BT is concerned about Apple's growing market power in the smartphone industry, particularly with the rise of eSims.

The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment. Combining these factors, the probability of a stock price decline seems higher due to the critical level approach coupled with market negativity.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
