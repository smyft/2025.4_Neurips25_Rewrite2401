Wall Street's biggest worry is whether momentum can last.\nNews Content: For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.\n\nIn 2024, that finally changed.\n\nThe five giants \u2014 Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) \u2014 collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNetflix led the charge, pulling in roughly $6.9 billion in earnings in the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the company the unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reported an additional $1.87 billion in profits to end the fourth quarter \u2014 and nearly 20 million more subscribers.\n\nThe other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.\n\nLast year delivered some early answers. Disney and Paramount Global each reported their first quarter of streaming profits in August. Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as \"progress,\" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.\n\nFor Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is \"the pace of revenue growth.\" He added, \"To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.\"\n\nFor traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. \"Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.\n\nThat low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns. Lourdes Balduque via Getty Images\n\nIn response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers through controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.\n\nCompanies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.\n\n\"Everything was kind of messy for a few years,\" Macquarie's Nollen said. \"Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.\"\n\n(edited)\n\nOne obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. (Netflix became the latest platform to boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)\n\n\"The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,\" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, \"there's a limit\" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.\n\n\"Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,\" he said.\n\nTo combat fickle subscribers, competing platforms are now bundling their services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, \"There's more strength together.\"\n\n\"I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,\" Dolgin said. \"So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.\"\n\nAnd if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix \u2014 and just basic survival in the streaming-first era \u2014 might be a bumpy one.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NFLX)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently experiencing significant stock price pressure, nearing a critical technical support level (the 200-day moving average) which, if breached, could trigger further losses and a loss of investor confidence. The stock has had one of its worst starts to the year in nearly two decades, while the overall market, represented by the S&P 500, has gained. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report might create uncertainty, leading to potential volatility. The mixed views on the potential for future growth in services and wearables may not sufficiently counteract the current downtrend. Overall, the analysis suggests a higher probability for a fall given the current market sentiment and technical indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader streaming landscape and its positive trend toward profitability in 2024. While it doesn't directly mention Apple's streaming service (Apple TV+), the overall positive sentiment in the industry is likely to have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock. The article highlights Netflix's success and explores challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent and significant streaming profits. Therefore, Apple may be indirectly affected by overall trends in the industry, but it is not a main focus considering this analysis. The news does not give a strong directional impetus for Apple's stock, considering, if any, Apple's streaming profits are likely to be small as compared to other ventures by Apple. Therefore, the probability for its stock rising is only slightly higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with its stock price nearing a critical 200-day moving average.  This technical indicator suggests potential further losses if breached, indicating a bearish sentiment among some analysts.  While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects citing potential growth in services and wearables, and upcoming earnings, the immediate near-term outlook appears negative due to the current market trends and the approaching critical support level. The fact that Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization further adds to the negative sentiment. The overall tone of the article leans towards a pessimistic outlook, although the upcoming earnings announcement could act as a catalyst for either a rise or fall depending on the results. However, given the current negative momentum and the proximity to a key technical support level, the probability of a fall is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggests a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools position it as a resilient stock in potential bear markets. The company's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further strengthens its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact the stock. The presence of hedge fund interest and the stock's inclusion in lists of best bear market stocks indicate underlying confidence, but macroeconomic risks and sector-specific challenges temper the optimism. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both outcomes are plausible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests that BT is concerned about Apple's growing market power in the smartphone industry, particularly with the rise of eSims. This could potentially lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of Apple, which might result in a negative impact on the company's stock price. On the other hand, Apple's dominant position in the market and its ability to adapt to changing technologies could mitigate the potential risks. Considering these points, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year. The stock approaching the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator, raises concerns among traders. Analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic view, believing in growth potential from services and wearables despite current softness in the iPhone cycle. Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is experiencing substantial downward pressure on its stock, nearing a critical 200-day moving average that could trigger further declines if breached. Analysts express concerns about a loss of investor confidence, especially after Apple's poor start to the year compared to the S&P 500's gains. While there is some optimism regarding future growth from services and wearables, the immediate sentiment remains negative due to broader market trends, reduced market capitalization relative to Nvidia, and the upcoming earnings report that may add to volatility. Weighing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the streaming industry's profitability shift. While positive for the industry overall, its direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect, as Apple TV+ is only part of Apple's diverse business. The article raises concerns about sustainable profits and subscriber churn, challenges applicable to Apple TV+ as well. Given the previous round's varied predictions and the lack of strong directional indication in this specific news, I modestly adjust my estimation. A rise is possible, but not guaranteed, as a generalized trend from others is rising while this article presents concerns for the overall market trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Negative factors include its worst start to the year since 2008, nearing a critical 200-day moving average, and being overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  Analyst sentiment is divided, with some expressing concern about the potential for further losses if the 200-day moving average is breached, while others remain optimistic about long-term growth potential in services and wearables. The upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard, potentially driving either a rise or fall depending on the results.  Considering the current negative momentum, proximity to a key technical support level, and the overall bearish sentiment reflected in several previous predictions (particularly the negative trend observed in the initial rounds), the probability of a fall appears higher than that of a rise in the short term. However, the potential for a positive earnings report and long-term growth prospects prevent this from being a definitively bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL).

Additionally, the inclusion of Apple in lists of best bear market stocks indicates underlying confidence. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact the stock. Previous predictions also show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, influenced by technical indicators and market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses Apple's stock performance and the upcoming earnings reports of major companies, including Apple. Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas. Concerns about China's impact on Apple's business and its AI strategy have contributed to this decline. However, some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the coming months, which could potentially boost the stock. Given these mixed views and the current negative momentum, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests that BT is concerned about Apple's growing market power in the smartphone industry, particularly with the rise of eSims. This could potentially lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of Apple, which might result in a negative impact on the company's stock price. However, considering the overall trend of others' predictions, which indicate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, and the fact that Apple's dominant position in the market and its ability to adapt to changing technologies could mitigate the potential risks, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year.

Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment. Combining these factors, the probability of a stock price decline seems higher due to the critical level approach coupled with market negativity.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing considerable pressure, with its shares near a critical 200-day moving average. This proximity raises the risk of further declines if the level is breached, which can trigger a loss of confidence among investors. The stock has already experienced an 11% drop this year, contrasting sharply with a broader market gain. While some analysts express optimism regarding future growth from services and wearables, the overall sentiment is dampened by recent performance and the upcoming earnings announcement, which adds another layer of uncertainty. Given these factors and the trend in previous predictions leaning towards a bearish outlook, the probability of falling stock prices is assessed to be higher than that of rising prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader streaming landscape and its positive trend towards profitability. While Apple TV+ is part of Apple's services, it's not a primary driver. The sustainability of streaming profits and subscriber churn are concerns applicable to all platforms, including Apple TV+. Previous predictions are varied. Given the focus on the broader streaming industry rather than specific Apple initiatives, the impact is likely neutral. The article doesn't give cause to push the stock drastically either way, but the general sentiment based on previous predictions appears optimistic but with considerable downside risks. Additionally, the potential bundling that excludes Apple and layoffs across main competitors should serve as a downside signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  The key factors are: 1) Apple's stock is experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, down 11%. 2) The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level.  A breakdown below this level could trigger further selling. 3)  Analysts are expressing concern about waning investor confidence. 4) While there is some optimism regarding future growth in services and wearables, the current negative momentum and the proximity to a critical support level outweigh these positive aspects in the short term. 5)  The upcoming earnings report is a wildcard but the current sentiment is largely negative. 6) The analysis of prior predictions reveals a consistent bearish trend, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price fall. While some models show a higher probability for a price rise, the majority points towards a fall. This strengthens the overall bearish sentiment observed from the news. Considering all these factors, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc.

Multiple analysts have expressed their concern that breaching this critical support level could further erode investor confidence. While there is optimism regarding the company's growth potential in services and wearables, the current negative momentum, combined with the overtaking of Apple's market capitalization by Nvidia and the broader market context, leads to a higher probability of stock price decline. The upcoming earnings report introduces an element of uncertainty, but given the prevailing bearish sentiment and the historical trend of predictions showing a decline, the overall likelihood of a stock price rise appears lower.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
