(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones\nNews Content: BT van\n\nBT has called for a competition crackdown on Apple over concerns the tech giant could use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks.\n\nThe operator has raised concerns that the rise of virtual \u201ceSims\u201d that replace Sim cards could see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.\n\nIn a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: \u201cWe also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d\n\nPhysical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and its rivals risk losing ground to the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.\n\nThe threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.\n\nBT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.\n\nHowever, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.\n\nKester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: \u201cOne of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there\u2019s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that\u2019s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.\u201d\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks \u2013 similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile \u2013 though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.\n\neSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.\n\nApple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.\n\nBT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: \u201cIncreased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.\u201d\n\nVodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.\n\nApple did not comment on the BT submission.\n\nIn response to last week\u2019s CMA investigation it said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently experiencing significant stock price pressure, nearing a critical technical support level (the 200-day moving average) which, if breached, could trigger further losses and a loss of investor confidence. The stock has had one of its worst starts to the year in nearly two decades, while the overall market, represented by the S&P 500, has gained. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report might create uncertainty, leading to potential volatility. The mixed views on the potential for future growth in services and wearables may not sufficiently counteract the current downtrend. Overall, the analysis suggests a higher probability for a fall given the current market sentiment and technical indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader streaming landscape and its positive trend toward profitability in 2024. While it doesn't directly mention Apple's streaming service (Apple TV+), the overall positive sentiment in the industry is likely to have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock. The article highlights Netflix's success and explores challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent and significant streaming profits. Therefore, Apple may be indirectly affected by overall trends in the industry, but it is not a main focus considering this analysis. The news does not give a strong directional impetus for Apple's stock, considering, if any, Apple's streaming profits are likely to be small as compared to other ventures by Apple. Therefore, the probability for its stock rising is only slightly higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with its stock price nearing a critical 200-day moving average.  This technical indicator suggests potential further losses if breached, indicating a bearish sentiment among some analysts.  While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects citing potential growth in services and wearables, and upcoming earnings, the immediate near-term outlook appears negative due to the current market trends and the approaching critical support level. The fact that Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization further adds to the negative sentiment. The overall tone of the article leans towards a pessimistic outlook, although the upcoming earnings announcement could act as a catalyst for either a rise or fall depending on the results. However, given the current negative momentum and the proximity to a key technical support level, the probability of a fall is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggests a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools position it as a resilient stock in potential bear markets. The company's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further strengthens its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact the stock. The presence of hedge fund interest and the stock's inclusion in lists of best bear market stocks indicate underlying confidence, but macroeconomic risks and sector-specific challenges temper the optimism. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both outcomes are plausible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests that BT is concerned about Apple's growing market power in the smartphone industry, particularly with the rise of eSims. This could potentially lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of Apple, which might result in a negative impact on the company's stock price. On the other hand, Apple's dominant position in the market and its ability to adapt to changing technologies could mitigate the potential risks. Considering these points, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year. The stock approaching the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator, raises concerns among traders. Analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic view, believing in growth potential from services and wearables despite current softness in the iPhone cycle. Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is experiencing substantial downward pressure on its stock, nearing a critical 200-day moving average that could trigger further declines if breached. Analysts express concerns about a loss of investor confidence, especially after Apple's poor start to the year compared to the S&P 500's gains. While there is some optimism regarding future growth from services and wearables, the immediate sentiment remains negative due to broader market trends, reduced market capitalization relative to Nvidia, and the upcoming earnings report that may add to volatility. Weighing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the streaming industry's profitability shift. While positive for the industry overall, its direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect, as Apple TV+ is only part of Apple's diverse business. The article raises concerns about sustainable profits and subscriber churn, challenges applicable to Apple TV+ as well. Given the previous round's varied predictions and the lack of strong directional indication in this specific news, I modestly adjust my estimation. A rise is possible, but not guaranteed, as a generalized trend from others is rising while this article presents concerns for the overall market trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Negative factors include its worst start to the year since 2008, nearing a critical 200-day moving average, and being overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  Analyst sentiment is divided, with some expressing concern about the potential for further losses if the 200-day moving average is breached, while others remain optimistic about long-term growth potential in services and wearables. The upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard, potentially driving either a rise or fall depending on the results.  Considering the current negative momentum, proximity to a key technical support level, and the overall bearish sentiment reflected in several previous predictions (particularly the negative trend observed in the initial rounds), the probability of a fall appears higher than that of a rise in the short term. However, the potential for a positive earnings report and long-term growth prospects prevent this from being a definitively bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, it highlights Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools, which position it as a resilient stock in potential bear markets. The company's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further strengthens its appeal. Additionally, the inclusion of Apple in lists of best bear market stocks indicates underlying confidence. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact the stock. Previous predictions also show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, influenced by technical indicators and market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses Apple's stock performance and the upcoming earnings reports of major companies, including Apple. Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas. Concerns about China's impact on Apple's business and its AI strategy have contributed to this decline. However, some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the coming months, which could potentially boost the stock. Given these mixed views and the current negative momentum, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests that BT is concerned about Apple's growing market power in the smartphone industry, particularly with the rise of eSims. This could potentially lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of Apple, which might result in a negative impact on the company's stock price. However, considering the overall trend of others' predictions, which indicate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, and the fact that Apple's dominant position in the market and its ability to adapt to changing technologies could mitigate the potential risks, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year. The stock approaching the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator, raises concerns among traders.

Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment. Combining these factors, the probability of a stock price decline seems higher due to the critical level approach coupled with market negativity.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing considerable pressure, with its shares near a critical 200-day moving average. This proximity raises the risk of further declines if the level is breached, which can trigger a loss of confidence among investors. The stock has already experienced an 11% drop this year, contrasting sharply with a broader market gain. While some analysts express optimism regarding future growth from services and wearables, the overall sentiment is dampened by recent performance and the upcoming earnings announcement, which adds another layer of uncertainty. Given these factors and the trend in previous predictions leaning towards a bearish outlook, the probability of falling stock prices is assessed to be higher than that of rising prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader streaming landscape and its positive trend towards profitability. While Apple TV+ is part of Apple's services, it's not a primary driver. The sustainability of streaming profits and subscriber churn are concerns applicable to all platforms, including Apple TV+. Previous predictions are varied. Given the focus on the broader streaming industry rather than specific Apple initiatives, the impact is likely neutral. The article doesn't give cause to push the stock drastically either way, but the general sentiment based on previous predictions appears optimistic but with considerable downside risks. Additionally, the potential bundling that excludes Apple and layoffs across main competitors should serve as a downside signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  The key factors are: 1) Apple's stock is experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, down 11%. 2) The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level.  A breakdown below this level could trigger further selling. 3)  Analysts are expressing concern about waning investor confidence. 4) While there is some optimism regarding future growth in services and wearables, the current negative momentum and the proximity to a critical support level outweigh these positive aspects in the short term. 5)  The upcoming earnings report is a wildcard but the current sentiment is largely negative. 6) The analysis of prior predictions reveals a consistent bearish trend, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price fall. While some models show a higher probability for a price rise, the majority points towards a fall. This strengthens the overall bearish sentiment observed from the news. Considering all these factors, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc.

Multiple analysts have expressed their concern that breaching this critical support level could further erode investor confidence. While there is optimism regarding the company's growth potential in services and wearables, the current negative momentum, combined with the overtaking of Apple's market capitalization by Nvidia and the broader market context, leads to a higher probability of stock price decline. The upcoming earnings report introduces an element of uncertainty, but given the prevailing bearish sentiment and the historical trend of predictions showing a decline, the overall likelihood of a stock price rise appears lower.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is facing significant pressure with its stock nearing a critical 200-day moving average, which analysts suggest could trigger further declines if breached. This has contributed to a sentiment of decreased confidence among investors, especially as the company has had one of its worst starts to the year since 2008, losing 11% while the broader market has gained. While there is some optimism regarding potential growth from services and wearables, it appears insufficient to counteract the immediate negative trends.

While Apple TV+ contributes to Apple's overall services revenue, it's not the dominant driver. The article doesn't provide a clear, direct catalyst for AAPL's stock. A key factor influencing my prediction is the trend in previous rounds. While some models initially saw potential for a rise, the consensus has shifted towards a higher probability of a fall, driven by Apple's recent underperformance and technical indicators (like approaching the 200-day moving average) which have the overall probabilities leaning bearish. The layoffs and restructurings among competitors also casts a negative sentiment over the streaming business.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  Key negative factors include its worst start to the year since 2008, nearing a critical 200-day moving average (a breach could trigger further selling), and being overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization. Analyst sentiment is mixed, but the immediate negative momentum and proximity to a critical support level outweigh the positive long-term growth potential mentioned. The upcoming earnings report is uncertain, but the current sentiment is largely negative.  The consistent bearish trend in previous predictions reinforces this negative outlook. While some models show a likelihood of a price increase, the majority shows a higher probability of a price decline.
