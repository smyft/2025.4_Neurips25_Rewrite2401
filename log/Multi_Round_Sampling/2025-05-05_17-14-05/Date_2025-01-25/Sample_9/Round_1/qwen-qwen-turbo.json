(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\nNews Content: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a turbulent beginning to 2025, with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.\n\nWhat Happened: Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth\u2019s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest\u00a0performer in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019\u00a0group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nApple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock\u2019s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.\n\n\u201cWhen\u00a0you get names starting to\u00a0flirt with it or start\u00a0to break below it, you\u00a0kind of lose confidence that\u00a0the uptrend of that name\u00a0is still intact,\u201d Todd Sohn, an ETF\u00a0and technical strategist at Strategas\u00a0Securities LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple\u2019s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline, Nvidia has now overtaken Apple in market value.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. \"It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we're anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off,\" said Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC.\n\nTrending: Coinbase\u2019s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) \u2014 Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer.\n\nApple is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on January 30, after market close, an event that investors are closely watching.\u00a0Despite the stock\u2019s current performance, analysts remain optimistic about Apple\u2019s future. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, believes that Apple\u2019s dependence on the iPhone remains, but services and wearables offer growth potential. Additionally, Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Securities predicts that Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings might not miss a beat, despite a softer iPhone cycle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Apple was planning a \u201cmassive investment\u201d in the United States. This was part of Trump\u2019s initiative to accelerate major corporate investments in the U.S.\n\nPrice Action: Apple shares ended 0.39% lower on Friday. Year-to-date the company\u2019s shares lost 8.64%, as reported by Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\n\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently experiencing significant stock price pressure, nearing a critical technical support level (the 200-day moving average) which, if breached, could trigger further losses and a loss of investor confidence. The stock has had one of its worst starts to the year in nearly two decades, while the overall market, represented by the S&P 500, has gained. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report might create uncertainty, leading to potential volatility. The mixed views on the potential for future growth in services and wearables may not sufficiently counteract the current downtrend. Overall, the analysis suggests a higher probability for a fall given the current market sentiment and technical indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader streaming landscape and its positive trend toward profitability in 2024. While it doesn't directly mention Apple's streaming service (Apple TV+), the overall positive sentiment in the industry is likely to have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock. The article highlights Netflix's success and explores challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent and significant streaming profits. Therefore, Apple may be indirectly affected by overall trends in the industry, but it is not a main focus considering this analysis. The news does not give a strong directional impetus for Apple's stock, considering, if any, Apple's streaming profits are likely to be small as compared to other ventures by Apple. Therefore, the probability for its stock rising is only slightly higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with its stock price nearing a critical 200-day moving average.  This technical indicator suggests potential further losses if breached, indicating a bearish sentiment among some analysts.  While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects citing potential growth in services and wearables, and upcoming earnings, the immediate near-term outlook appears negative due to the current market trends and the approaching critical support level. The fact that Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization further adds to the negative sentiment. The overall tone of the article leans towards a pessimistic outlook, although the upcoming earnings announcement could act as a catalyst for either a rise or fall depending on the results. However, given the current negative momentum and the proximity to a key technical support level, the probability of a fall is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggests a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools position it as a resilient stock in potential bear markets. The company's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further strengthens its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact the stock. The presence of hedge fund interest and the stock's inclusion in lists of best bear market stocks indicate underlying confidence, but macroeconomic risks and sector-specific challenges temper the optimism. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both outcomes are plausible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones' suggests that BT is concerned about Apple's growing market power in the smartphone industry, particularly with the rise of eSims. This could potentially lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of Apple, which might result in a negative impact on the company's stock price. On the other hand, Apple's dominant position in the market and its ability to adapt to changing technologies could mitigate the potential risks. Considering these points, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year. The stock approaching the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator, raises concerns among traders. Analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic view, believing in growth potential from services and wearables despite current softness in the iPhone cycle. Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
