(AAPL) but rather discuss two popular AI stocks that certain Wall Street analysts predict will drop in value by 24% and 66% in 2025. Since Apple Inc. is not mentioned in the context of a predicted drop, and given that the news does not provide specific information about AAPL's future performance, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal or neutral. However, the general negative sentiment around AI stocks could indirectly affect AAPL if it's perceived as related, but given AAPL's diversified business and not being specifically targeted, we can assume a low impact. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are close to neutral, but slightly leaning towards a positive outlook due to the lack of direct negative information about AAPL.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop24% and66% in2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
