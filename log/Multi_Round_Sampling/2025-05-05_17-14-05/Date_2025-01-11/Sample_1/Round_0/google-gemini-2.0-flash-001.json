While the headline itself does not mention Apple directly, it might indirectly impact investor sentiment due to its presence in the broader tech landscape. Many consider it to be an AI stock due to its investment in the technology, so there could be a negative response. However, given Apple's overall strong fundamentals, diversification, and market capitalization, the direct impact is probably limited. Analyst target drops of 24% and 66% for *other* (unstated) AI stocks are alarming. The impact on AAPL is uncertain. Therefore the stock might remain neutral. So, considering the AI connection along with other factors such as the overall market conditions, consumer confidence, upcoming product launches and investor sentiment about the brand name, the stock price probably won't dramatically go up or down.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
