(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses investing mistakes and reflections on past performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author expresses a positive long-term view on Apple's brand and growth, despite acknowledging that its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. This analysis indicates a cautious optimism about Apple's future, though it also raises awareness of the risks associated with complacency. Overall, while the author's reflection may suggest a need for vigilance rather than panic, it does not provide substantial negative sentiment that would likely lead to a sharp decline in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately high, while the probability of it falling is moderate due to potential competitive headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is generally neutral news. However, potential market reactions depend on investor perceptions of a Trump administration and its potential impact on Apple. Since Trump's policies are viewed as relatively pro-business, the market may see this as a positive indicator that Apple can navigate the coming political landscape effectively. Also, Apple attending along with CEOs of other big tech companies can provide a more positive view of Apple among investors. Given the very small scope and neutral nature of the news, the change can be expected to be small. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance that the stock will rise than fall. However, given market unpredictability, there always exists a possibility that the price will drop instead.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concern about the overreliance on iPhone sales, the potential for disappointing earnings, and the general market sentiment suggesting downside surprise. While he acknowledges the possibility of a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is skeptical. The article also highlights the significant number of hedge fund holders in Apple (158), suggesting a high level of institutional investment and possibly some inertia against significant price movement in either direction.  However, Cramer's negative outlook significantly impacts the probability of a price rise. The statement \"Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\" strongly suggests a pessimistic view. Considering all factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than that of a price rise, but the influence of existing institutional investment moderates the potential magnitude of the price change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, Trump's administration has been critical of Big Tech, but this gesture could imply reduced regulatory risks for Apple in the near term. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases, which could pose risks. The market may view Cook's attendance as a positive signal, but the broader regulatory environment remains uncertain. Overall, the news leans slightly positive for Apple, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Trump's tense relationship with Big Tech in the past has not necessarily translated to negative stock performance for these companies. In fact, the attendance of major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive sign for the company. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment or at least a neutral stance from the Trump administration towards Big Tech. However, the news does not provide specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively. The overall impact on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive due to the potential for improved relations between the tech industry and the Trump administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes that the author made in 2024, including not updating investment theses, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the companies the author has held for a long time and notes that while the company has a strong brand and products, its growth has been slower compared to other companies. The author also mentions that there is no guarantee that the stock will fall, but it's still a favorable investment. Based on this information, the article does not contain any major negative news or revelations about Apple Inc. that would significantly impact its stock price. However, the article does suggest that the author is taking a more cautious approach to their investment in Apple, which could indicate a slightly negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate to AAPL directly, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article reflects on past investment mistakes and emphasizes the importance of diligence and not becoming complacent with investments like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author maintains a positive long-term outlook on Apple, there are acknowledgments of competitive pressures and slower growth relative to peers. This balanced view indicates caution rather than outright pessimism. Given the general sentiment of cautious optimism and some recognition of potential risks, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge a measurable chance of falling due to competition and complacency. Thus, I assign a probability of 0.58 for a rise and 0.42 for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. While not explicitly positive or negative, it suggests a willingness from Apple to engage with the Trump administration. A more favorable regulatory environment or reduced political headwinds for Apple could be perceived as a positive signal by the market. Considering previous rounds where there was a variety of predictions of Apple's movement and noting that the presence of Apple's CEO is generally either neutral or positive, along with a lack of significantly negative financial news, I lean toward a slightly positive outlook. Some other models found the news positive. Therefore, there is a slightly increased chance of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple.  He cites concerns about iPhone sales dependence, potential for earnings disappointment, and a general market sentiment suggesting downside surprise.  While he mentions a possible 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is pessimistic.  The phrase 'Apple Wildcard To The Downside' strongly suggests a negative prediction.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.05 to 0.75 probability of a price fall. The consensus leans towards a slight probability of a fall, but the range of the previous predictions demonstrates uncertainty.  Considering Cramer's negative commentary and the lack of significant countervailing positive news, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall. However, Apple's size and established position suggest the potential movement will be relatively moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While historically tense, the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain favorable relations, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, as improved relations with the administration may reduce regulatory risks, but the broader regulatory environment remains uncertain. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive and others neutral or slightly negative. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of direct, impactful news, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a rise due to the potential for improved relations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Trump's tense relationship with Big Tech in the past has not necessarily translated to negative stock performance for these companies. The attendance of Apple's CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive sign for the company, indicating a potential for a more favorable regulatory environment or at least a neutral stance from the Trump administration towards Big Tech. However, the news does not provide specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed view but generally a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to improved relations between the tech industry and the Trump administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article discusses the author's reflections on investing mistakes, including complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author notes that while Apple has a strong brand, its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. The article does not provide substantial negative sentiment but rather a cautious optimism about Apple's future, suggesting a need for vigilance rather than panic. Considering the previous predictions, which showed a range of opinions from slightly positive to slightly negative, and taking into account the neutral to slightly positive tone of the article, the estimated probabilities for the stock price movement are balanced, leaning slightly towards a positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The related predictions provided earlier suggest mixed sentiments about Apple's stock movement. Given the lack of direct connection between the news and Apple's operations or market dynamics, it is reasonable to assume minimal impact on stock price movements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
