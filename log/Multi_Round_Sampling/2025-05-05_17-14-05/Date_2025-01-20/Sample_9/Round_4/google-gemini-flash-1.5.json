(AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses investing mistakes and reflections on past performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author expresses a positive long-term view on Apple's brand and growth, despite acknowledging that its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. This analysis indicates a cautious optimism about Apple's future, though it also raises awareness of the risks associated with complacency. Overall, while the author's reflection may suggest a need for vigilance rather than panic, it does not provide substantial negative sentiment that would likely lead to a sharp decline in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately high, while the probability of it falling is moderate due to potential competitive headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is generally neutral news. However, potential market reactions depend on investor perceptions of a Trump administration and its potential impact on Apple. Since Trump's policies are viewed as relatively pro-business, the market may see this as a positive indicator that Apple can navigate the coming political landscape effectively. Also, Apple attending along with CEOs of other big tech companies can provide a more positive view of Apple among investors. Given the very small scope and neutral nature of the news, the change can be expected to be small. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance that the stock will rise than fall. However, given market unpredictability, there always exists a possibility that the price will drop instead.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concern about the overreliance on iPhone sales, the potential for disappointing earnings, and the general market sentiment suggesting downside surprise. While he acknowledges the possibility of a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is skeptical. The article also highlights the significant number of hedge fund holders in Apple (158), suggesting a high level of institutional investment and possibly some inertia against significant price movement in either direction.  However, Cramer's negative outlook significantly impacts the probability of a price rise. The statement \"Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\" strongly suggests a pessimistic view. Considering all factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than that of a price rise, but the influence of existing institutional investment moderates the potential magnitude of the price change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, Trump's administration has been critical of Big Tech, but this gesture could imply reduced regulatory risks for Apple in the near term. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases, which could pose risks. The market may view Cook's attendance as a positive signal, but the broader regulatory environment remains uncertain. Overall, the news leans slightly positive for Apple, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Trump's tense relationship with Big Tech in the past has not necessarily translated to negative stock performance for these companies. In fact, the attendance of major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive sign for the company. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment or at least a neutral stance from the Trump administration towards Big Tech. However, the news does not provide specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively. The overall impact on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive due to the potential for improved relations between the tech industry and the Trump administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes that the author made in 2024, including not updating investment theses, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the companies the author has held for a long time and notes that while the company has a strong brand and products, its growth has been slower compared to other companies. The author also mentions that there is no guarantee that the stock will fall, but it's still a favorable investment. Based on this information, the article does not contain any major negative news or revelations about Apple Inc. that would significantly impact its stock price. However, the article does suggest that the author is taking a more cautious approach to their investment in Apple, which could indicate a slightly negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate to AAPL directly, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article reflects on past investment mistakes and emphasizes the importance of diligence and not becoming complacent with investments like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author maintains a positive long-term outlook on Apple, there are acknowledgments of competitive pressures and slower growth relative to peers. This balanced view indicates caution rather than outright pessimism. Given the general sentiment of cautious optimism and some recognition of potential risks, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge a measurable chance of falling due to competition and complacency. Thus, I assign a probability of 0.58 for a rise and 0.42 for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. While not explicitly positive or negative, it suggests a willingness from Apple to engage with the Trump administration. A more favorable regulatory environment or reduced political headwinds for Apple could be perceived as a positive signal by the market. Considering previous rounds where there was a variety of predictions of Apple's movement and noting that the presence of Apple's CEO is generally either neutral or positive, along with a lack of significantly negative financial news, I lean toward a slightly positive outlook. Some other models found the news positive. Therefore, there is a slightly increased chance of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple.  He cites concerns about iPhone sales dependence, potential for earnings disappointment, and a general market sentiment suggesting downside surprise.  While he mentions a possible 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is pessimistic.  The phrase 'Apple Wildcard To The Downside' strongly suggests a negative prediction.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.05 to 0.75 probability of a price fall. The consensus leans towards a slight probability of a fall, but the range of the previous predictions demonstrates uncertainty.  Considering Cramer's negative commentary and the lack of significant countervailing positive news, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall. However, Apple's size and established position suggest the potential movement will be relatively moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While historically tense, the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain favorable relations, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, as improved relations with the administration may reduce regulatory risks, but the broader regulatory environment remains uncertain. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive and others neutral or slightly negative. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of direct, impactful news, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a rise due to the potential for improved relations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Trump's tense relationship with Big Tech in the past has not necessarily translated to negative stock performance for these companies. The attendance of Apple's CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive sign for the company, indicating a potential for a more favorable regulatory environment or at least a neutral stance from the Trump administration towards Big Tech. However, the news does not provide specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed view but generally a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to improved relations between the tech industry and the Trump administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article discusses the author's reflections on investing mistakes, including complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author notes that while Apple has a strong brand, its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. The article does not provide substantial negative sentiment but rather a cautious optimism about Apple's future, suggesting a need for vigilance rather than panic. Considering the previous predictions, which showed a range of opinions from slightly positive to slightly negative, and taking into account the neutral to slightly positive tone of the article, the estimated probabilities for the stock price movement are balanced, leaning slightly towards a positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The related predictions provided earlier suggest mixed sentiments about Apple's stock movement. Given the lack of direct connection between the news and Apple's operations or market dynamics, it is reasonable to assume minimal impact on stock price movements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news reflects on past investment mistakes and emphasizes the importance of diligence in maintaining a strong investment thesis, particularly for a company like Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author's acknowledgment of complacency in their investment builds a sense of cautious optimism rather than outright pessimism about Apple's future potential. While there are competitive pressures and a recognition that Apple's growth has slowed compared to its peers, the overall tone does not suggest severe negative sentiment that would lead to a significant decline in stock price. Therefore, a balanced perspective yields a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration, signaling a potential willingness to engage with the new administration. Historically, positive or neutral interactions between tech companies and the government can be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to reduced regulatory uncertainty. However, it's important to consider that this event, in isolation, doesn't guarantee a stock price increase. It mostly signals a willingness to work alongside the government and navigate any arising political climates. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there has been a swing with most believing the stock price had a higher chance of rising rather than falling, I'll assign it a slightly higher chance of the stock price increasing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple.  He expresses concerns about Apple's over-reliance on iPhone sales, the potential for disappointing earnings, and the prevailing market sentiment suggesting a downside surprise. While acknowledging a possible extended strong iPhone cycle, his overall tone is decidedly pessimistic.  The phrase 'Apple Wildcard To The Downside' is particularly impactful, strongly suggesting a negative prediction. Previous predictions are mixed, but the majority lean slightly towards a fall, reflecting uncertainty in the market.  Cramer's negative commentary and the lack of significant countervailing positive news strongly suggest a greater probability of a price fall.  However, Apple's size and established market presence might moderate the magnitude of any price change.  Considering the prevailing negativity and the historical predictions showing a tendency towards a fall, I've weighted the probability of a price drop higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain favorable relations, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, as improved relations with the administration may reduce regulatory risks, but the broader regulatory environment remains uncertain. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive and others neutral or slightly negative. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of direct, impactful news, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a rise due to the potential for improved relations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article discusses reflections on past investment mistakes and the importance of diligence, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of the companies mentioned. The author notes Apple's strong brand and growth but also acknowledges slower growth compared to peers and potential competitive pressures. Considering the mixed but generally cautious optimism in the article and previous predictions from other models, I estimate a balanced probability for the stock price movement. However, given the article's cautionary tone and the lack of substantial positive news, I slightly favor a neutral to slightly negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The related predictions provided earlier suggest mixed sentiments about Apple's stock movement. Given the lack of direct connection between the news and Apple's operations or market dynamics, it is reasonable to assume minimal impact on stock price movements.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article reflects on past investment mistakes related to Apple Inc., emphasizing the importance of diligence and avoiding complacency. While it recognizes Apple's strong brand and market leadership, it also highlights concerns regarding its slowing growth compared to competitors. This acknowledgment introduces a certain level of skepticism without suggesting any imminent negative events. The sentiment shows cautious optimism overall; thus, the likelihood of the stock price rising is moderately higher than that of it falling, although competitive pressures may temper this rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's inauguration. This can be interpreted as a positive signal, suggesting improved relations or a willingness to engage with the new administration, which could reduce regulatory uncertainty. However, the impact is likely moderate. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, opinions are mixed, but there's a slight leaning towards a positive outlook. Given this and the neutral-to-slightly-positive nature of the news, I'll assign a slightly higher chance of the stock price increasing. However, one model has consistently provided a very low probability due to the news not directly impacting Apple, which is also a relevant consideration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece is dominated by Jim Cramer's negative assessment of Apple's prospects. He highlights concerns about over-reliance on iPhone sales, potential for earnings disappointment, and a generally bearish market sentiment.  While acknowledging the possibility of a sustained strong iPhone cycle, his overall tone is deeply pessimistic, using phrases like \"Apple Wildcard To The Downside\" which strongly suggests a negative outlook.  The numerous previous predictions, while varied, tend to show a leaning towards a price fall, reflecting the uncertainty but also a bias stemming from the negative Cramer commentary.  While Apple's size and established market position could moderate any dramatic price swings, Cramer's opinion carries weight and the lack of countervailing positive news significantly tilts the probabilities towards a fall.  I'm also considering that the previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly lower belief in the stock rising over time. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is weighted higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain favorable relations, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, as improved relations with the administration may reduce regulatory risks, but the broader regulatory environment remains uncertain. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive and others neutral or slightly negative. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of direct, impactful news, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a rise due to the potential for improved relations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and the attendance of Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration. This event signals an effort to maintain favorable relations with the administration, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, as improved relations with the administration may reduce regulatory risks, but the broader regulatory environment remains uncertain.

The overall tone of the article is cautious optimism, suggesting a need for vigilance rather than panic. Considering the mixed but generally cautious optimism in the article and previous predictions from other models, I estimate a balanced probability for the stock price movement. However, given the article's cautionary tone and the lack of substantial positive news, I slightly favor a neutral to slightly negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc.
