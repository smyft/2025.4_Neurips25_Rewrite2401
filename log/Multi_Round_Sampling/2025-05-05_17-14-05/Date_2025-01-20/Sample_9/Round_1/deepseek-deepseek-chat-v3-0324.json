(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses investing mistakes and reflections on past performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author expresses a positive long-term view on Apple's brand and growth, despite acknowledging that its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. This analysis indicates a cautious optimism about Apple's future, though it also raises awareness of the risks associated with complacency. Overall, while the author's reflection may suggest a need for vigilance rather than panic, it does not provide substantial negative sentiment that would likely lead to a sharp decline in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately high, while the probability of it falling is moderate due to potential competitive headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is generally neutral news. However, potential market reactions depend on investor perceptions of a Trump administration and its potential impact on Apple. Since Trump's policies are viewed as relatively pro-business, the market may see this as a positive indicator that Apple can navigate the coming political landscape effectively. Also, Apple attending along with CEOs of other big tech companies can provide a more positive view of Apple among investors. Given the very small scope and neutral nature of the news, the change can be expected to be small. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance that the stock will rise than fall. However, given market unpredictability, there always exists a possibility that the price will drop instead.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concern about the overreliance on iPhone sales, the potential for disappointing earnings, and the general market sentiment suggesting downside surprise. While he acknowledges the possibility of a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is skeptical. The article also highlights the significant number of hedge fund holders in Apple (158), suggesting a high level of institutional investment and possibly some inertia against significant price movement in either direction.  However, Cramer's negative outlook significantly impacts the probability of a price rise. The statement \"Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\" strongly suggests a pessimistic view. Considering all factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than that of a price rise, but the influence of existing institutional investment moderates the potential magnitude of the price change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, Trump's administration has been critical of Big Tech, but this gesture could imply reduced regulatory risks for Apple in the near term. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases, which could pose risks. The market may view Cook's attendance as a positive signal, but the broader regulatory environment remains uncertain. Overall, the news leans slightly positive for Apple, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Trump's tense relationship with Big Tech in the past has not necessarily translated to negative stock performance for these companies. In fact, the attendance of major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive sign for the company. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment or at least a neutral stance from the Trump administration towards Big Tech. However, the news does not provide specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively. The overall impact on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive due to the potential for improved relations between the tech industry and the Trump administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes that the author made in 2024, including not updating investment theses, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the companies the author has held for a long time and notes that while the company has a strong brand and products, its growth has been slower compared to other companies. The author also mentions that there is no guarantee that the stock will fall, but it's still a favorable investment. Based on this information, the article does not contain any major negative news or revelations about Apple Inc. that would significantly impact its stock price. However, the article does suggest that the author is taking a more cautious approach to their investment in Apple, which could indicate a slightly negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate to AAPL directly, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
