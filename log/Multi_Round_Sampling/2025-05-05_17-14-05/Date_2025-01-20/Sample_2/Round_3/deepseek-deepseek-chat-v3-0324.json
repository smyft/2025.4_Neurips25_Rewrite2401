A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump\u2019s inauguration can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, being part of a political event may signal alignment with potential pro-business policies or initiatives that could positively affect the stock market sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. On the other hand, political events can also introduce uncertainty and potential backlash depending on public perception, which could weigh negatively. However, historical precedence suggests that such events tend to favor business optimism. Given the overall sentiment surrounding tech companies and potential for favorable policies, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned trip to China and Taiwan. It also mentions other Big Tech CEOs attending and discusses Big Tech's relationship with Trump. This news item doesn't directly or significantly impact Apple. The attendance or non-attendance of other tech leaders at an inauguration, or the relationship between other tech companies and the president have very little direct bearing upon Apple's business or stock performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed and that the assumption of continued boom times is unwarranted.  The author's self-critique doesn't predict a fall, but suggests a need for increased diligence and reevaluation of the investment thesis, implying the probability of significant upward price movement is reduced compared to the author's prior optimistic outlook. The news itself is not negative, but it highlights a potential for future performance to be less spectacular than previously assumed. The mention of Apple in the context of past successful investments (the \"double down\" section) is likely unrelated to the article's core analysis and shouldn't be taken as a strong indicator of future price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on the attendance (or absence) of Big Tech CEOs at Donald Trump's inauguration, with specific mention of Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending due to a preplanned business trip. The news does not contain any direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL), nor does it suggest any material impact on Apple's business operations, financial performance, or market position. Since the news is unrelated to Apple, it is unlikely to influence AAPL's stock price in any significant way. The probabilities of a stock price rise or fall due to this news are thus minimal and largely neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses subtle investing mistakes and mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency. The author reflects on their investment in Apple, noting that while the company's performance over the last 10 years has been impressive, it has not been as stellar as expected, and there are potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. However, the author concludes that Apple is still a favorable investment. The article does not contain any directly negative news about Apple, nor does it provide new information that would significantly alter the stock's prospects. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the mention of headwinds and complacency, but the overall tone is not bearish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and lessons learned, specifically mentioning Apple (AAPL) as a stock they hold. The author notes that while Apple's performance is impressive, its growth rate is not as high as some other companies, and there are potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. The author's tone is reflective and cautionary, emphasizing the importance of ongoing diligence and not assuming past performance will continue indefinitely. Based on this analysis, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it highlights potential risks and encourages investors to re-evaluate their thesis.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple's CEO at a prominent political event like Trump\u2019s inauguration could be viewed positively by the market, suggesting potential alignment with government policies that could favor businesses, including tech companies. Additionally, while some predictions leaned towards neutrality or slight negativity due to concerns about growth and market competition, others recognized the historical tendency for such events to foster business optimism. Given the mixed signals in previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rise, weighing the potential positive sentiment against some cautionary notes around Apple\u2019s growth rate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and mentions other tech leaders' attendance. This event is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's operations or financial performance. Previous models' predictions varied, with some assigning slight negativity due to discussions of investing mistakes mentioning Apple. However, the core issue is the attendance of other companies CEOs to the event, which does not directly affect Apple itself. Considering all factors and the lack of direct relevance, the stock price impact should be neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on an individual investor's reflection on their past investing mistakes, mentioning Apple as one of their holdings.  The author points out that while Apple's performance has been strong, its growth rate has slowed, and there are potential headwinds due to market saturation and competition. However, the overall tone is not overtly negative; the author simply advocates for increased diligence and a reevaluation of their investment thesis. This is not new information impacting Apple's fundamentals.  The previous predictions vary widely, none definitively showing strong evidence for either a rise or fall. Because the news is primarily introspective and doesn't present new material information regarding Apple's prospects, its impact is likely minimal. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise, acknowledging Apple's established position and the lack of negative news, while factoring in the author's call for a more cautious outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the attendance of Big Tech CEOs at Donald Trump's inauguration, with a specific mention of Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending due to a preplanned business trip. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the news, and there is no indication of any material impact on Apple's business operations, financial performance, or market position. Given the lack of relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to influence AAPL's stock price in any significant way. Therefore, the probabilities of a stock price rise or fall due to this news are minimal and largely neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses subtle investing mistakes made by the author and mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency. The author notes that while Apple's performance over the last 10 years has been impressive, with a 63.6% rise in quarterly revenue and a 43.9% growth in free cash flow, its growth rate has not been as stellar as expected. The author also mentions potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. However, the author concludes that Apple is still a favorable investment. The article does not contain any directly negative news about Apple, nor does it provide new information that would significantly alter the stock's prospects. The overall tone is reflective and cautionary, emphasizing the importance of ongoing diligence and not assuming past performance will continue indefinitely. Based on this analysis, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it highlights potential risks and encourages investors to re-evaluate their thesis.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and lessons learned, specifically mentioning Apple (AAPL) as a stock they hold.

The author's tone is reflective and cautionary, emphasizing the importance of ongoing diligence and not assuming past performance will continue indefinitely. Based on this analysis, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it highlights potential risks and encourages investors to re-evaluate their thesis. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of slightly negative to neutral sentiment towards Apple's stock price movement. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. According to the previous predictions from various models, there is a mix of neutral to slightly negative sentiments. Several models predicted a neutral impact due to the lack of direct relevance to Apple, while a few predicted a slight negative sentiment due to cautionary tones. Considering all these factors, the overall impact of the news on Apple's stock price is expected to be negligible.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price, as it doesn't provide new information about the company's operations or financial performance. While there are mixed sentiments in previous predictions, many analysts suggest that the news has a neutral to slightly negative tone due to concerns about Apple's growth and market competition. Overall, the probabilities reflect a cautious approach, with a higher chance of price stability or a slight downward move rather than a substantial rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and lists other tech executives who will be present. This information is not directly related to Apple's business operations, financial performance, or market position. While some models suggested slight negativity in previous rounds due to mentions of investment complacency and slowed growth for Apple, the core subject of this particular news piece is irrelevant to Apple. I am factoring in prior predictions which tended to sway towards neutral or slightly negative but ultimately considering the news insignificant to AAPL's market performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on an individual investor's reflection on their investing mistakes, mentioning Apple's slower growth rate and potential headwinds.  However, it doesn't present negative news about Apple's fundamentals. The author's self-critique is not a market-moving event; it's a personal reflection. The previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities of a price rise ranging from 0.05 to 0.65 and probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.05 to 0.6.  Considering the lack of significant new information about Apple in the news and the wide range of previous predictions, I assign a slightly higher probability of no significant change than a rise or fall.  The existing uncertainty in the market regarding Apple's future growth is already factored into the stock price. This news offers little new information to significantly alter this.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the attendance of Big Tech CEOs at Donald Trump's inauguration, with a specific mention of Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending due to a preplanned business trip.
