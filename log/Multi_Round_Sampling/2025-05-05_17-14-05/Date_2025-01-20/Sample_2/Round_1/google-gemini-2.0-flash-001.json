A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump\u2019s inauguration can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, being part of a political event may signal alignment with potential pro-business policies or initiatives that could positively affect the stock market sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. On the other hand, political events can also introduce uncertainty and potential backlash depending on public perception, which could weigh negatively. However, historical precedence suggests that such events tend to favor business optimism. Given the overall sentiment surrounding tech companies and potential for favorable policies, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned trip to China and Taiwan. It also mentions other Big Tech CEOs attending and discusses Big Tech's relationship with Trump. This news item doesn't directly or significantly impact Apple. The attendance or non-attendance of other tech leaders at an inauguration, or the relationship between other tech companies and the president have very little direct bearing upon Apple's business or stock performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed and that the assumption of continued boom times is unwarranted.  The author's self-critique doesn't predict a fall, but suggests a need for increased diligence and reevaluation of the investment thesis, implying the probability of significant upward price movement is reduced compared to the author's prior optimistic outlook. The news itself is not negative, but it highlights a potential for future performance to be less spectacular than previously assumed. The mention of Apple in the context of past successful investments (the \"double down\" section) is likely unrelated to the article's core analysis and shouldn't be taken as a strong indicator of future price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on the attendance (or absence) of Big Tech CEOs at Donald Trump's inauguration, with specific mention of Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending due to a preplanned business trip. The news does not contain any direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL), nor does it suggest any material impact on Apple's business operations, financial performance, or market position. Since the news is unrelated to Apple, it is unlikely to influence AAPL's stock price in any significant way. The probabilities of a stock price rise or fall due to this news are thus minimal and largely neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses subtle investing mistakes and mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency. The author reflects on their investment in Apple, noting that while the company's performance over the last 10 years has been impressive, it has not been as stellar as expected, and there are potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. However, the author concludes that Apple is still a favorable investment. The article does not contain any directly negative news about Apple, nor does it provide new information that would significantly alter the stock's prospects. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the mention of headwinds and complacency, but the overall tone is not bearish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and lessons learned, specifically mentioning Apple (AAPL) as a stock they hold. The author notes that while Apple's performance is impressive, its growth rate is not as high as some other companies, and there are potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. The author's tone is reflective and cautionary, emphasizing the importance of ongoing diligence and not assuming past performance will continue indefinitely. Based on this analysis, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it highlights potential risks and encourages investors to re-evaluate their thesis.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
