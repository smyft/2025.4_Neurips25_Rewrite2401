A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration, which primarily concerns Nvidia and its executives rather than Apple Inc. While there could be indirect effects on the tech sector due to political sentiments, there is no direct information or catalyst that affects Apple's performance. Given this, any impact on AAPL stock price is expected to be minimal, maintaining a neutral outlook. Thus, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising or falling is estimated to be equal.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Trump's inauguration. This event, in itself, is not definitively positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market reaction will largely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their potential impact on Apple. Generally, market stability or perceived pro-business policies could be seen as favorable. However, any perceived alignment with potentially controversial policies could alienate parts of Apple's consumer base. The market also reacts to the general sentiment towards 'Big Tech' at any given point in time. Since the news is primarily observational (attendance at an inauguration), and the immediate market reaction is often based on speculation, a moderate impact on the stock is anticipated. Assuming no major policy announcements immediately following the inauguration have a large impact, a slight positive bias is factored due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, because the information provided has nothing to do with Apple's earnings, the likelihood of a major shift in stock price is minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  While past tensions between Trump and Big Tech existed, this event offers a potential for reduced regulatory risk for Apple. However, the news is rather vague and lacks specific details about policy changes or potential impacts to Apple. The article also mentions broader trends in the tech sector (consolidation, legal challenges), but these are not directly tied to Apple's specific situation.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probabilities reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, Trump's tensions with Big Tech have led to volatility, but this gesture could reduce regulatory risks for Apple in the short term. However, ongoing antitrust concerns and broader market sentiment around Big Tech remain uncertain. The attendance of tech leaders at the inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a lower probability of immediate negative regulatory action against Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggest a bearish outlook, indicating that the stock could be a 'wildcard to the downside.' He expresses skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter, citing potential weaknesses in iPhone sales and the impact of the Chinese economy. Cramer also mentions that many research pieces suggest Apple could surprise to the downside, implying that the stock's performance may not meet expectations. This negative sentiment could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes, including complacency with their investment in Apple. The author notes that Apple's performance is not as strong as commonly perceived, with slower growth compared to other companies. However, the article does not contain any fundamentally negative news about Apple, and the author still considers it a favorable investment. The tone of the article is more cautionary and reflective, rather than alarmist or bearish. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is not significantly affected by this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions key figures from major tech companies, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook. While the attendance of tech executives at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive signal, the article also highlights ongoing challenges and potential consolidations in the tech industry, which could negatively impact Apple's stock. The broader context of legal challenges and antitrust concerns adds further uncertainty. Without clear signals pointing to specific positive outcomes for Apple, the balance leans towards neutral to negative sentiments.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
