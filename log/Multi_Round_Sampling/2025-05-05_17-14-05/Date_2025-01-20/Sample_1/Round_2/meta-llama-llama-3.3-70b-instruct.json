(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration, which primarily concerns Nvidia and its executives rather than Apple Inc. While there could be indirect effects on the tech sector due to political sentiments, there is no direct information or catalyst that affects Apple's performance. Given this, any impact on AAPL stock price is expected to be minimal, maintaining a neutral outlook. Thus, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising or falling is estimated to be equal.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Trump's inauguration. This event, in itself, is not definitively positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market reaction will largely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their potential impact on Apple. Generally, market stability or perceived pro-business policies could be seen as favorable. However, any perceived alignment with potentially controversial policies could alienate parts of Apple's consumer base. The market also reacts to the general sentiment towards 'Big Tech' at any given point in time. Since the news is primarily observational (attendance at an inauguration), and the immediate market reaction is often based on speculation, a moderate impact on the stock is anticipated. Assuming no major policy announcements immediately following the inauguration have a large impact, a slight positive bias is factored due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, because the information provided has nothing to do with Apple's earnings, the likelihood of a major shift in stock price is minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  While past tensions between Trump and Big Tech existed, this event offers a potential for reduced regulatory risk for Apple. However, the news is rather vague and lacks specific details about policy changes or potential impacts to Apple. The article also mentions broader trends in the tech sector (consolidation, legal challenges), but these are not directly tied to Apple's specific situation.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probabilities reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, Trump's tensions with Big Tech have led to volatility, but this gesture could reduce regulatory risks for Apple in the short term. However, ongoing antitrust concerns and broader market sentiment around Big Tech remain uncertain. The attendance of tech leaders at the inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a lower probability of immediate negative regulatory action against Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggest a bearish outlook, indicating that the stock could be a 'wildcard to the downside.' He expresses skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter, citing potential weaknesses in iPhone sales and the impact of the Chinese economy. Cramer also mentions that many research pieces suggest Apple could surprise to the downside, implying that the stock's performance may not meet expectations. This negative sentiment could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes, including complacency with their investment in Apple. The author notes that Apple's performance is not as strong as commonly perceived, with slower growth compared to other companies. However, the article does not contain any fundamentally negative news about Apple, and the author still considers it a favorable investment. The tone of the article is more cautionary and reflective, rather than alarmist or bearish. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is not significantly affected by this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions key figures from major tech companies, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook. While the attendance of tech executives at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive signal, the article also highlights ongoing challenges and potential consolidations in the tech industry, which could negatively impact Apple's stock. The broader context of legal challenges and antitrust concerns adds further uncertainty. Without clear signals pointing to specific positive outcomes for Apple, the balance leans towards neutral to negative sentiments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of various Big Tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, which could signal an effort to reduce regulatory risks and maintain a positive relationship with the administration. However, there are no substantial policy changes disclosed in the news that could directly influence Apple's performance. Given the mixed sentiment of previous predictions, with some leaning towards a slight positive bias due to potential stability, but also taking into account ongoing market uncertainties and negative sentiments about broader tech sector performance, I've determined a cautious but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. This event, while observational, could signal a potential shift in the relationship between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Considering Trump's past stance on big tech, a cordial relationship could be interpreted as a positive sign, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. However, it's essential to separate the event from any concrete policy changes or specific implications for Apple's financials. Given this balancing act and the historical data, the likelihood of a significant immediate upswing is moderate, and the risk of a downturn, due to negative sentiment towards Trump policies or perceived negative relationships between Apple and its consumer base, is considerable. I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a more neutral outlook, but with a consideration on the uncertainty and sentiment regarding Trump's policies. Considering the trend that in the previous round, other models indicated a neutral to slightly negative impact from this news, I will assign a probability close to that level.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news piece is largely observational, focusing on Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration.  This event, while potentially signaling a desire for positive relations with the Trump administration (and thus potentially reduced regulatory risk), lacks concrete information about any changes to Apple's business prospects or market position.  The article also mentions broader trends (consolidation in smaller tech firms, legal challenges), but these are not directly related to Apple's immediate future. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean toward a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  Considering the lack of specific and substantive news directly impacting Apple, and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term market reactions to largely symbolic events,  the probability of the stock price rising or falling remains close to even. I've slightly weighted towards a neutral position, reflecting the overall lack of strong drivers for a significant price change either way.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, highlighting Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration as a potential signal of improved relations. While this could reduce short-term regulatory risks for Apple, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust concerns for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. The market's reaction will likely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their perceived impact on Apple. Given the mixed signals and lack of direct financial implications for Apple, the impact on the stock price is expected to be neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a range of neutral to slightly positive outlooks, with probabilities leaning towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Jim Cramer, indicating that the stock could be a 'wildcard to the downside.' Cramer expresses skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter, citing potential weaknesses in iPhone sales and the impact of the Chinese economy. He also mentions that many research pieces suggest Apple could surprise to the downside, implying that the stock's performance may not meet expectations. This negative sentiment could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general trend of caution and uncertainty, with several models leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes, including complacency with their investment in Apple.

However, the article does not contain any fundamentally negative news about Apple, and the author still considers it a favorable investment. The tone of the article is more cautionary and reflective, rather than alarmist or bearish. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a range of opinions on the potential impact of the news on Apple's stock price. Some models predict a slight positive bias due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community, while others suggest a more neutral or slightly negative outlook. Given the lack of concrete negative news and the author's continued favorable view of Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook's attendance at his inauguration. While this gesture might suggest a less adversarial relationship with the administration, leading to potential regulatory benefits, there are mixed signals and uncertainties. Several predictions indicate a range of sentiments, from cautiously optimistic to bearish. Considering Jim Cramer's bearish view on Apple due to potential weaknesses in iPhone sales and concerns about the Chinese economy, there is a considerable amount of skepticism. The article also highlights ongoing legal challenges and market sentiment, adding further uncertainties.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
