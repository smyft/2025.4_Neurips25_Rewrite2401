(AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration, which primarily concerns Nvidia and its executives rather than Apple Inc. While there could be indirect effects on the tech sector due to political sentiments, there is no direct information or catalyst that affects Apple's performance. Given this, any impact on AAPL stock price is expected to be minimal, maintaining a neutral outlook. Thus, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising or falling is estimated to be equal.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Trump's inauguration. This event, in itself, is not definitively positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market reaction will largely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their potential impact on Apple. Generally, market stability or perceived pro-business policies could be seen as favorable. However, any perceived alignment with potentially controversial policies could alienate parts of Apple's consumer base. The market also reacts to the general sentiment towards 'Big Tech' at any given point in time. Since the news is primarily observational (attendance at an inauguration), and the immediate market reaction is often based on speculation, a moderate impact on the stock is anticipated. Assuming no major policy announcements immediately following the inauguration have a large impact, a slight positive bias is factored due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, because the information provided has nothing to do with Apple's earnings, the likelihood of a major shift in stock price is minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  While past tensions between Trump and Big Tech existed, this event offers a potential for reduced regulatory risk for Apple. However, the news is rather vague and lacks specific details about policy changes or potential impacts to Apple. The article also mentions broader trends in the tech sector (consolidation, legal challenges), but these are not directly tied to Apple's specific situation.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probabilities reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, Trump's tensions with Big Tech have led to volatility, but this gesture could reduce regulatory risks for Apple in the short term. However, ongoing antitrust concerns and broader market sentiment around Big Tech remain uncertain. The attendance of tech leaders at the inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a lower probability of immediate negative regulatory action against Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggest a bearish outlook, indicating that the stock could be a 'wildcard to the downside.' He expresses skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter, citing potential weaknesses in iPhone sales and the impact of the Chinese economy. Cramer also mentions that many research pieces suggest Apple could surprise to the downside, implying that the stock's performance may not meet expectations. This negative sentiment could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes, including complacency with their investment in Apple. The author notes that Apple's performance is not as strong as commonly perceived, with slower growth compared to other companies. However, the article does not contain any fundamentally negative news about Apple, and the author still considers it a favorable investment. The tone of the article is more cautionary and reflective, rather than alarmist or bearish. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is not significantly affected by this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions key figures from major tech companies, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook. While the attendance of tech executives at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive signal, the article also highlights ongoing challenges and potential consolidations in the tech industry, which could negatively impact Apple's stock. The broader context of legal challenges and antitrust concerns adds further uncertainty. Without clear signals pointing to specific positive outcomes for Apple, the balance leans towards neutral to negative sentiments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of various Big Tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, which could signal an effort to reduce regulatory risks and maintain a positive relationship with the administration. However, there are no substantial policy changes disclosed in the news that could directly influence Apple's performance. Given the mixed sentiment of previous predictions, with some leaning towards a slight positive bias due to potential stability, but also taking into account ongoing market uncertainties and negative sentiments about broader tech sector performance, I've determined a cautious but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. This event, while observational, could signal a potential shift in the relationship between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Considering Trump's past stance on big tech, a cordial relationship could be interpreted as a positive sign, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. However, it's essential to separate the event from any concrete policy changes or specific implications for Apple's financials. Given this balancing act and the historical data, the likelihood of a significant immediate upswing is moderate, and the risk of a downturn, due to negative sentiment towards Trump policies or perceived negative relationships between Apple and its consumer base, is considerable. I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a more neutral outlook, but with a consideration on the uncertainty and sentiment regarding Trump's policies. Considering the trend that in the previous round, other models indicated a neutral to slightly negative impact from this news, I will assign a probability close to that level.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news piece is largely observational, focusing on Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration.  This event, while potentially signaling a desire for positive relations with the Trump administration (and thus potentially reduced regulatory risk), lacks concrete information about any changes to Apple's business prospects or market position.  The article also mentions broader trends (consolidation in smaller tech firms, legal challenges), but these are not directly related to Apple's immediate future. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean toward a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  Considering the lack of specific and substantive news directly impacting Apple, and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term market reactions to largely symbolic events,  the probability of the stock price rising or falling remains close to even. I've slightly weighted towards a neutral position, reflecting the overall lack of strong drivers for a significant price change either way.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, highlighting Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration as a potential signal of improved relations. While this could reduce short-term regulatory risks for Apple, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust concerns for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. The market's reaction will likely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their perceived impact on Apple. Given the mixed signals and lack of direct financial implications for Apple, the impact on the stock price is expected to be neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a range of neutral to slightly positive outlooks, with probabilities leaning towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Jim Cramer, indicating that the stock could be a 'wildcard to the downside.' Cramer expresses skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter, citing potential weaknesses in iPhone sales and the impact of the Chinese economy. He also mentions that many research pieces suggest Apple could surprise to the downside, implying that the stock's performance may not meet expectations. This negative sentiment could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general trend of caution and uncertainty, with several models leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes, including complacency with their investment in Apple.

However, the article does not contain any fundamentally negative news about Apple, and the author still considers it a favorable investment. The tone of the article is more cautionary and reflective, rather than alarmist or bearish. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a range of opinions on the potential impact of the news on Apple's stock price. Some models predict a slight positive bias due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community, while others suggest a more neutral or slightly negative outlook. Given the lack of concrete negative news and the author's continued favorable view of Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook's attendance at his inauguration. While this gesture might suggest a less adversarial relationship with the administration, leading to potential regulatory benefits, there are mixed signals and uncertainties. Several predictions indicate a range of sentiments, from cautiously optimistic to bearish. Considering Jim Cramer's bearish view on Apple due to potential weaknesses in iPhone sales and concerns about the Chinese economy, there is a considerable amount of skepticism. The article also highlights ongoing legal challenges and market sentiment, adding further uncertainties.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
