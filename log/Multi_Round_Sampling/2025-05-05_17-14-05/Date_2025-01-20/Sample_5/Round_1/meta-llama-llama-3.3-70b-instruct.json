(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\nNews Content: As President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony is underway, many are taking note of the Silicon Valley personalities in attendance. Yahoo Finance host Rachelle Akuffo joins the program to acknowledge several of the Big Tech CEOs at Trump's swearing-in, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta Platforms' (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Apple (AAPL) chief executive, and even TikTok president Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAhead of the January 20 ceremony, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang stated he will be out of the country but \"look[s] forward to congratulating the Trump administration when they take office.\"\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration, which primarily concerns Nvidia and its executives rather than Apple Inc. While there could be indirect effects on the tech sector due to political sentiments, there is no direct information in the article that would influence Apple's stock price positively or negatively. Therefore, the probabilities for AAPL's stock price movement remain neutral, suggesting a higher likelihood of stability with minimal fluctuations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a potentially neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). The fact that Tim Cook attended Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a good relationship. This could potentially lead to favorable policies or reduced regulatory scrutiny for Apple under a Trump administration. However, antimonopoly cases against Big Tech remain a concern. Since the overall tone is more towards engagement than conflict, I am estimating a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling. The mention of potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms and ongoing legal challenges might indirectly affect Apple, which has a slightly dampening impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed, and there's no guarantee of continued boom times.  The author's self-critique highlights a potential for underestimation of market headwinds and the need for more diligent analysis, suggesting a cautionary stance. However, the overall tone isn't overwhelmingly negative; the author still considers Apple a favorable investment.  The article itself doesn't predict a price movement but suggests a need for more careful monitoring and less complacency. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral position with a very small probability of a price fall, reflecting the author's continued favorable view but also the warning of potential for slower growth.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock is vulnerable to iPhone sales reports, which account for more than half of its revenue, and he doesn't anticipate a good quarter for the company. Additionally, he highlights the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple, noting that many analysts expect Apple to surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the stock's recent lagging performance, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that Apple's stock is a 'wildcard to the downside' and that he doesn't think Apple will have a good quarter. He also mentions that many research pieces indicate Apple could surprise to the downside, implying that the stock might be overvalued and vulnerable to a decline, especially given the significant role iPhone sales play in Apple's revenue. These statements are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of these CEOs may indicate a positive relationship between the tech industry and the new administration, potentially leading to favorable policies and regulations. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is largely speculative and may be influenced by market sentiment and broader industry trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer dismisses the notion of strong iPhone sales growth and suggests skepticism over current valuations, expressing concerns about Apple's upcoming quarter performance. Moreover, he likens China to East Germany emphasizing a potential economic impact due to Chinese policies, which could affect Apple's business in the region. On the other hand, there is no outright negative recommendation, and historical data of Cramer\u2019s picks show potential for outperformance. However, the overall tone leans cautious with a focus on downside risks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
