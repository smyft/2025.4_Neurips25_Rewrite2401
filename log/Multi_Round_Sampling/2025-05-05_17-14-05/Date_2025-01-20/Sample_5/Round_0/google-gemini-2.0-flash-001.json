The fact that Tim Cook attended Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a good relationship. This could potentially lead to favorable policies or reduced regulatory scrutiny for Apple under a Trump administration. However, antimonopoly cases against Big Tech remain a concern. Since the overall tone is more towards engagement than conflict, I am estimating a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.
