(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration, which primarily concerns Nvidia and its executives rather than Apple Inc. While there could be indirect effects on the tech sector due to political sentiments, there is no direct information in the article that would influence Apple's stock price positively or negatively. Therefore, the probabilities for AAPL's stock price movement remain neutral, suggesting a higher likelihood of stability with minimal fluctuations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a potentially neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). The fact that Tim Cook attended Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a good relationship. This could potentially lead to favorable policies or reduced regulatory scrutiny for Apple under a Trump administration. However, antimonopoly cases against Big Tech remain a concern. Since the overall tone is more towards engagement than conflict, I am estimating a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling. The mention of potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms and ongoing legal challenges might indirectly affect Apple, which has a slightly dampening impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed, and there's no guarantee of continued boom times.  The author's self-critique highlights a potential for underestimation of market headwinds and the need for more diligent analysis, suggesting a cautionary stance. However, the overall tone isn't overwhelmingly negative; the author still considers Apple a favorable investment.  The article itself doesn't predict a price movement but suggests a need for more careful monitoring and less complacency. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral position with a very small probability of a price fall, reflecting the author's continued favorable view but also the warning of potential for slower growth.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock is vulnerable to iPhone sales reports, which account for more than half of its revenue, and he doesn't anticipate a good quarter for the company. Additionally, he highlights the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple, noting that many analysts expect Apple to surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the stock's recent lagging performance, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that Apple's stock is a 'wildcard to the downside' and that he doesn't think Apple will have a good quarter. He also mentions that many research pieces indicate Apple could surprise to the downside, implying that the stock might be overvalued and vulnerable to a decline, especially given the significant role iPhone sales play in Apple's revenue. These statements are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of these CEOs may indicate a positive relationship between the tech industry and the new administration, potentially leading to favorable policies and regulations. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is largely speculative and may be influenced by market sentiment and broader industry trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer dismisses the notion of strong iPhone sales growth and suggests skepticism over current valuations, expressing concerns about Apple's upcoming quarter performance. Moreover, he likens China to East Germany emphasizing a potential economic impact due to Chinese policies, which could affect Apple's business in the region. On the other hand, there is no outright negative recommendation, and historical data of Cramer\u2019s picks show potential for outperformance. However, the overall tone leans cautious with a focus on downside risks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the attendance of major tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration and lacks direct relevance to Apple's business or performance. While there may be broader implications for the tech sector, the specific mention of Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance suggests an effort to engage positively with the administration. However, overall market sentiments, including concerns about iPhone sales and exposure to the Chinese economy, weigh down on the potential for Apple\u2019s stock price to rise significantly. Therefore, I estimate a neutral-slant probability leaning slightly towards a potential fall due to existing market concerns, giving a somewhat cautious outlook amidst mostly neutral news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, signaling a potential effort to stay in favor with the administration. This could lead to favorable policies or less regulatory scrutiny. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models suggesting a rise due to potential positive relationships and others suggesting a fall due to Jim Cramer's concerns and potential economic impacts in China. Considering the mixed signals and the trend of fluctuating beliefs in prior rounds, I will predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, as the attempt to maintain a good relationship with a potentially influential figure is generally seen as positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on an investor's reflection on past investing mistakes, with one example relating to Apple.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical success but highlights a recent deceleration in growth and the risk of complacency. This is not explicitly negative news, as the author still views Apple favorably. However, the emphasis on the need for increased diligence and the observation of slower growth compared to other companies suggests a slightly increased probability of a price stagnation or slight decline rather than significant growth. The previous predictions are widely varied, reflecting the lack of significant directional information in the news itself. My prediction incorporates the author's cautious tone and the inherent uncertainty present when dealing with such reflective, rather than event-driven, news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a cautious outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), primarily driven by Jim Cramer's comments. Cramer highlights the stock's vulnerability due to its heavy reliance on iPhone sales, which account for more than half of its revenue. He also expresses skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter, suggesting that many analysts anticipate a downside surprise. Additionally, Cramer's negative stance on China's economic impact could further weigh on Apple's performance, given its significant exposure to the Chinese market. While there is no outright negative recommendation, the overall tone leans towards caution, with a focus on potential downside risks. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a higher probability of the stock price falling, aligning with the negative sentiment in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a potentially negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer refers to Apple as a 'wildcard to the downside' and expresses concerns about the company's upcoming quarter performance, particularly citing the significant role of iPhone sales in Apple's revenue. He also mentions that many analysts expect Apple to surprise to the downside, implying potential overvaluation and vulnerability to a decline. Although there are mixed sentiments and no outright negative recommendations, the overall tone leans cautious with a focus on downside risks. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a higher chance of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. While this could suggest a positive relationship between the tech industry and the new administration, potentially leading to favorable policies and regulations, it does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Considering the mixed sentiments from other predictions, with some indicating caution due to potential slower growth or negative market sentiments and others seeing a slightly positive outlook due to potential engagement with the new administration, a balanced approach seems most reasonable. The overall impact on Apple's stock price appears to be speculative and may be influenced by market sentiment and broader industry trends rather than the news itself.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's commentary expresses significant concern about the company's stock price movement, specifically mentioning that Apple is vulnerable to iPhone sales reports and that he doesn't anticipate a good quarter for the company. He also notes that many research pieces indicate Apple could surprise to the downside. These factors suggest a pessimistic outlook which is likely to affect investor sentiment. Previous predictions also lean towards a negative outlook, supporting the idea that the stock may fall more than it rises.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news primarily revolves around the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain positive relationships with the new administration. However, there is significant concern expressed about Apple's stock performance, particularly due to heavy reliance on iPhone sales and potential challenges in the Chinese market, as highlighted by analysts and commentators like Jim Cramer. Existing predictions show a mixed sentiment with a cautionary tone tilting towards a potential decline due to market apprehensions. Overall, while the attendance at the inauguration may signal some positive engagement, the fear surrounding iPhone sales and market exposure adds downward pressure, leading to a higher likelihood of stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, which could signal a positive relationship and potential for favorable policies. However, the article also acknowledges ongoing antitrust scrutiny facing Big Tech. The previous predictions show a range of sentiment. In round 0, the predictions are quite varied. In round 1, the predictions tend to be slightly negative. Considering this, I am moderately increasing the probability of price falling than rising. But the signal from the news is not strong.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news article is an opinion piece reflecting on past investing mistakes, with one example focusing on Apple.  The author acknowledges Apple's strengths but highlights a slowing growth rate and the dangers of complacency. This isn't directly negative news, as the author still views Apple favorably. However, the emphasis on needed diligence and slower growth relative to competitors suggests a higher probability of stagnation or a slight decline than significant growth.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the lack of directional information in the news. My prediction weights the author's cautious tone and the inherent uncertainty stemming from the reflective, rather than event-driven, nature of the news.  The previous rounds' predictions show significant divergence, preventing me from relying heavily on them; instead, I prioritize the core message of the article itself: a warning about complacency regarding Apple's future growth, despite acknowledging its current strength.  Therefore, the probabilities lean slightly toward a neutral-to-negative outcome, favoring a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation than a strong rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a cautious outlook on Apple Inc.
