The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. The presence of Apple's CEO at the inauguration could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive sign, as it may indicate a more collaborative approach between the company and the administration. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be fairly balanced, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or positive outcome.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
