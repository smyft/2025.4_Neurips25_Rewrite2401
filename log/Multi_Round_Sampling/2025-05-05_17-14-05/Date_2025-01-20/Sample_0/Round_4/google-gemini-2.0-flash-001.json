(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis of Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on potential vulnerabilities related to its reliance on iPhone sales and concerns about a disappointing quarterly performance. Cramer's mention of the 'wildcard to the downside' indicates that he believes there is a significant risk of the stock falling, especially as sources suggest that a negative surprise is anticipated by market participants. Given the current sentiment and the broader context of criticisms regarding valuation and performance, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price declining rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's past investing mistakes and specifically mentions Apple as a company they've held for a long time, but have become somewhat complacent about. While the author acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, existing products), they also point out that its growth has slowed down compared to other companies, and it faces headwinds. This suggests a more neutral perspective on Apple's future performance, as past high growth rates are recognized as potentially unsustainable. The article does not mention any other negative aspects about the short/mid-term performance. \n\nThe fact that the author holds a position long-term, and the article suggests that it is still a favorable investment, tempers any strong expectations of decline. The call to action is diligence instead of selling, suggesting that there may be positive change in the future. The 'Double Down' promotional element at the end of the article is also not specific to Apple and thus does not significantly affect the analysis.\n\nTaking everything into account, I'm assuming slightly greater probability that the stock price might decrease minimally in the very short term due to highlighting potentially less sensational growth, but the overall investment thesis, however, remains favorable in the longer term. This analysis takes into consideration that the average retail investor does not read investment articles deeply, and will see the term 'complacency' as a negative signal rather than a cause for deeper analysis of fundamentals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  While past tensions between Trump and Big Tech existed, this event offers a potential for reduced regulatory risk for Apple. However, the news is rather vague and lacks specific details about policy changes or potential impacts to Apple. The overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will likely play a much larger role in influencing AAPL's stock price than this single event. Therefore, the probability of a price change due to this specific news is considered low, with a slightly higher likelihood of no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's views on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting concerns about the company's reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside surprises in its upcoming quarter. Cramer mentions that the stock has been a laggard since the beginning of the year and that there is widespread belief it may be overvalued. Additionally, the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple is noted as a potential risk. Given these factors, the sentiment appears more negative than positive, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. This development is likely to be viewed neutrally to positively by investors, as it may reduce regulatory risks for Apple. However, the article does not provide specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to reduced regulatory uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. The presence of Apple's CEO at the inauguration could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive sign, as it may indicate a more collaborative approach between the company and the administration. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be fairly balanced, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or positive outcome.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions key figures from major tech companies, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook. While the attendance of tech executives at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive signal, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges, such as antitrust cases against major tech firms, which could pose risks for the sector. The focus on potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms might not directly impact larger companies like Apple but could influence broader market sentiment. Overall, the article does not provide specific, actionable insights for predicting Apple's stock price directly.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Based on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple's vulnerabilities, particularly its reliance on iPhone sales and the potential for a disappointing quarter, the overall sentiment leans bearish. Cramer's reference to Apple as a 'wildcard to the downside' and discussion of valuation concerns suggest a heightened risk of stock price decline. Despite some neutral perspectives expressed in the analysis, the prevailing tone highlights significant risks that could lead to a decrease in stock value. Consequently, the probability of a price drop is assessed higher than that of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article is focused on investing mistakes, specifically related to updating investment theses, avoiding complacency, and not assuming best outcomes. While the author holds a long position in AAPL, their statement that 'the company's actual performance does not bear out all of this common knowledge...There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment' suggests a neutral to slightly bearish perspective because they imply overvaluation and slowing growth. The recommendation to 'do the diligence' due to prior complacency over long periods has a negative connotation suggesting there is a problem currently. From the prediction history Gemini-2.0-flash-001 has similar reasoning. Because other predictions are negative also (0.25, 0.3 and 0.45), this also biases to a negative prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece is largely neutral regarding Apple.  While Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration might suggest a desire to avoid regulatory hurdles, it's a symbolic gesture lacking concrete implications for Apple's stock price. The article focuses more broadly on the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, and mentions other relevant factors like antitrust suits and small-cap consolidation, none of which directly impact Apple significantly.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty around AAPL's short-term movement based on this news alone.  Given the lack of specific positive or negative information directly related to Apple's financials or future prospects, the most likely scenario is little to no immediate stock price movement. I'm weighting my prediction more towards a slight probability of a rise based on the (weak) positive interpretation of Cook's presence at the inauguration, but mainly acknowledging the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on its heavy reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks in the upcoming quarter. Cramer's comments suggest that the stock may be overvalued and could face downward pressure due to anticipated poor performance. Additionally, concerns about the Chinese economy's impact on Apple add to the negative sentiment. While previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, the majority lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the bearish outlook and lack of positive catalysts mentioned in the news, the probability of the stock price falling is deemed higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This event suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, which could reduce regulatory risks for Apple. However, the article does not provide specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. The overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will likely play a much larger role in influencing AAPL's stock price than this single event. Given the neutral to slightly positive implications of the news, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling to be relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship, which could be viewed as a neutral to slightly positive sign. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments. Some models highlight the potential for reduced regulatory risk, while others mention concerns about Apple's reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside surprises. Taking into account the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news article and the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling to be fairly balanced.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration. While this gesture could be seen as a positive attempt to maintain a good relationship with the administration, reducing regulatory risks, the news is quite vague and doesn't provide specific actions or assurances. Most predictive models suggest a mix of neutral to slightly positive impacts, with some models favoring a slight probability of stock price increase due to the reduced regulatory risk. However, the prevailing sentiments about Apple, particularly concerning iPhone sales vulnerability and broader regulatory challenges, temper any bullish expectations. Overall, the analysis leans towards neutrality with a minor tilt towards a positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The overall sentiment from Jim Cramer's commentary appears to suggest a bearish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), particularly due to concerns over its reliance on iPhone sales and the potential for disappointing quarterly performance. Cramer's reference to Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside' indicates a significant risk of decline, especially given recent stock performance that has lagged behind other competitors. The analyses from various models reflect a consensus of negative sentiment, highlighting vulnerabilities in Apple's business model, which amplifies the probability of a price drop rather than a rise. While some models indicate slightly more neutral or positive stances, the prevailing bearish sentiment drives my prediction towards a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses potential investing mistakes and specifically mentions Apple. While the author states that Apple remains a favorable investment and has a valuable brand with room to grow, they also point out its slower revenue and free cash flow growth compared to other companies and acknowledge that Apple is facing headwinds due to saturation in core markets. The author's complacency regarding Apple suggests a potential overvaluation and prompts a call for more diligence, implying underlying concerns. This isn't overtly negative, but it signals a need for reassessment and acknowledges certain market challenges currently. Previous rounds lean bearish, suggesting negative short-term price action. I will move my prediction to be slightly less bearish due to the author stating Apple being favorable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple's immediate stock price movement.  While Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration could be interpreted as a positive sign for reduced regulatory risk, the article lacks concrete details about policy changes or their impact on Apple.  The previous predictions show considerable disagreement, ranging from a strong bearish outlook (probability of fall around 0.75) to a slightly bullish outlook (probability of rise around 0.55).  The lack of specific information directly affecting Apple's financials in the short-term, coupled with the mixed predictions, suggests that the impact of this news will be minimal. The prevailing bearish sentiment regarding Apple's reliance on iPhone sales and potential for disappointing performance, as highlighted in previous analyses, outweighs the weakly positive implication of Cook's presence at the inauguration.  Therefore, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, factoring in both the neutral news and the overall bearish sentiment toward Apple observed in prior analyses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing concerns about its heavy reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks in the upcoming quarter. Cramer's comments suggest the stock may be overvalued and could face downward pressure due to anticipated poor performance.

However, the prevailing sentiments about Apple, particularly concerning iPhone sales vulnerability and broader regulatory challenges, temper any bullish expectations. Overall, the analysis leans towards neutrality with a minor tilt towards a positive outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reflects a predominantly bearish sentiment regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL), particularly through Jim Cramer's commentary, which emphasizes the company's heavy reliance on iPhone sales and expresses concerns about potential downside surprises in its upcoming quarterly performance. The notion of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside' indicates significant risk, particularly in the context of market expectations. Previous predictions have largely leaned towards a bearish outlook, with many perspectives indicating that the stock may be overvalued and could face downward pressures due to anticipated poor performance and the negative impact of the Chinese economy. Although there are some neutral to slightly positive takes based on other factors, the overall prevailing sentiment suggests a higher probability of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's reflections on past investing mistakes, with a specific section on their holding of Apple (AAPL). While the investor still views Apple as a favorable investment, they acknowledge slower growth compared to other companies and recognize headwinds due to market saturation. This suggests a potentially overvalued situation and prompts a reassessment, implying underlying challenges. The call to action is for continued diligence rather than selling, suggesting some degree of neutrality, I believe the author recognizing mistakes as a cause for concern makes the market perception that he doesn't believe in Apple stock in the short term (even though he does in long term). Past predictions have varied, but there's been a trend toward more negative sentiment and probabilities of price decline. Based on the current article and this trend, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall because the perceived acknowledgement of Apple's headwinds (especially in smartphone segment) could prompt some market participants to re-evaluate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price. While Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration could be interpreted positively (reduced regulatory risk), it lacks specifics.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting uncertainty.  The lack of concrete positive or negative information directly related to Apple's financials makes a significant price movement based on this news alone unlikely.  However, the consensus leans slightly bearish due to concerns regarding iPhone sales dependence and potential for disappointing performance (as highlighted by Jim Cramer and echoed in multiple model analyses).  This bearish sentiment, although not directly arising from the provided news, significantly influences the overall prediction. Therefore, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall than a rise, acknowledging both the weak positive signal from the inauguration attendance and the prevailing negative sentiment regarding Apple's performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc.
