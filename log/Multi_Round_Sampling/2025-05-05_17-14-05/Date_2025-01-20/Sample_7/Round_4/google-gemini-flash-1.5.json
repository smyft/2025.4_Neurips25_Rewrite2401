(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, particularly with Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This may signal a more favorable stance towards tech companies in the near future, potentially leading to positive sentiment in the market for Apple. Additionally, the mention of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech could introduce uncertainty, but the overall tone suggests a potential easing of tensions. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is greater than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned trip to China and Taiwan. It also mentions other Big Tech CEOs attending and discusses Big Tech's relationship with Trump. This news item doesn't directly or significantly impact Apple. The attendance or non-attendance of other tech leaders at an inauguration, or the relationship between other tech companies and the president have very little direct bearing upon Apple's business or stock performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed and that the assumption of continued boom times is unwarranted.  The author's self-critique doesn't present any new negative information specific to Apple; instead, it highlights the need for continued diligence in evaluating even seemingly strong, established companies.  The article's focus is on the author's personal investing strategy and mistakes; it does not contain any market-moving information about Apple itself (e.g., new product announcements, changes in management, or significant financial news). Therefore the news is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in either direction.  The probability of a price increase or decrease is largely dependent on other market factors rather than the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock is vulnerable to iPhone sales reports, which account for a significant portion of its revenue. He also notes that there is widespread belief that Apple might report a weaker quarter, which could lead to a downside surprise. Additionally, Cramer highlights the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple, suggesting potential risks due to China's hostile stance. These factors collectively indicate a negative sentiment around Apple's stock in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that Apple's stock is a 'wildcard to the downside' and that he doesn't think Apple will have a good quarter. He also mentions that many research pieces indicate Apple could surprise to the downside, implying a potential negative impact on the stock price. However, Cramer also advises to 'own them, don't trade them,' which might mitigate some of the negative impact. Overall, the tone suggests more downside risk than upside potential in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news does not contain any information directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The news discusses the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump and the attendance of various Big Tech executives, including the absence of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Since there is no relevant information about Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a more conciliatory tone between Trump's administration and major tech companies, particularly through the attendance of prominent figures like Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration. This could suggest a potential easing of regulatory pressures, which may positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the backdrop of ongoing legal challenges and public scrutiny of Big Tech cannot be ignored, adding a level of uncertainty. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, tempered by potential downside risks stemming from broader economic concerns and previous negative sentiments expressed by analysts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration, specifically mentioning the absence of Nvidia's CEO due to a pre-planned trip to China and Taiwan. While this event might affect the overall sentiment towards tech companies, there is no direct implication for Apple's business operations or financial performance. The previous rounds' predictions are varied. Some earlier models considered the broader narrative of tech's relationship with politics and assigned some probability (leaning slightly higher) to a price increase. Later models, upon identifying a distinct lack of Apple-specific information, either shifted probabilities to be neutral or favored a price drop based on negative sentiments expressed elsewhere by analysts like Jim Cramer (even if not directly elicited from this news). I will weigh in line with those later rounds, expecting the event itself to be neutral, but acknowledging the previous round's bias toward negative information. Therefore, the probabilities will be very close to even, with a slight bias toward the probability that the stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on an individual investor's reflection on past investing mistakes, with Apple mentioned as an example of complacency in holding a seemingly strong stock without sufficient ongoing diligence.  The article itself doesn't contain any new information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects that would directly impact its stock price. While the author expresses some concern about the slowing growth rate of Apple compared to other companies, this is not novel information and is already factored into the market's valuation of Apple.  The previous predictions exhibit a wide range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock movements based on limited information.  Given the lack of new, market-moving information in this article, and considering the wide divergence of previous predictions, it's most reasonable to conclude that this news is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in either direction. Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities close to 0.5 for both price rise and fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), describing it as a 'wildcard to the downside' and suggesting that it may not have a good quarter. Cramer also mentions the potential impact of the Chinese economy on Apple, which adds to the downside risk. While he advises to 'own them, don't trade them,' the overall tone is pessimistic, with many research pieces indicating a potential downside surprise. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a fall and 0.3 to 0.5 for a rise. Given this collective analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, calling it a 'wildcard to the downside.' Cramer mentions that Apple's stock is vulnerable to iPhone sales reports, which account for a significant portion of its revenue. He also notes that there is widespread belief that Apple might report a weaker quarter, which could lead to a downside surprise. Additionally, Cramer highlights the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple, suggesting potential risks due to China's hostile stance. These factors collectively indicate a negative sentiment around Apple's stock in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any information directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The news discusses the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump and the attendance of various Big Tech executives, including the absence of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Since there is no relevant information about Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on its stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news should be considered neutral, with slightly higher probabilities assigned to no change or minimal impact. However, considering the broader context and the fact that some predictions from other models suggest a potential for negative sentiment due to unrelated factors, a slight edge might be given to a neutral to slight decline scenario. But given the information directly provided, the most accurate assessment is that the news does not significantly impact Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the participation of various Big Tech CEOs in the Trump inauguration, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook. However, this news does not contain explicit information that directly relates to Apple's financial health, operations, or strategic decisions. While some predict potential shifts in the regulatory environment or market perception, the immediate impact on the stock price seems minimal based on this news alone. Other provided models offer a range of predictions, from neutral to negative sentiments. Considering the lack of direct impact and weighing the mixed opinions, the probability of a significant rise in AAPL's stock price is moderate but not overwhelmingly positive.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, particularly with the presence of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration, which may signal a softer regulatory environment for tech companies in the future. However, there are substantial ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, and previous models express concerns regarding potential downside risks related to Apple's performance, particularly in light of Jim Cramer's negative commentary on Apple's stock potential. Given these contrasting factors, I predict a moderate probability of rising stock prices, tempered by concerns about broader economic challenges and market sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and mentions other Big Tech CEOs who will be attending. It doesn't contain any information directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. However, previous rounds indicated a mixed sentiment, with some focusing on potential regulatory shifts (positive) and others citing analysts' (Cramer) negative views on Apple regardless of this specific news event. There's no direct causal link between the news and Apple's stock, but the accumulated negative sentiment seems to have some weight. Considering the lack of direct impact and weighing the previous rounds' slightly negative sentiment, the probability of a significant fall in AAPL's stock price is slightly more likely than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on an individual investor's reflection on past investing mistakes, with Apple mentioned as one example.  The article does not contain any new information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects that would directly impact its stock price. While the author expresses concern about Apple's slowing growth rate, this is not novel information and is already factored into the market's valuation. The previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from a strong belief in a price rise to a strong belief in a price fall, further indicating that the article's impact is minimal. Most models in the later rounds recognize the lack of direct impact from this news, converging towards a neutral or near-neutral prediction. Therefore, I assign probabilities very close to 0.5 for both price rise and fall, reflecting the lack of market-moving information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Jim Cramer's negative sentiment towards Apple Inc.

Additionally, he points to potential risks from the Chinese economy. These factors collectively indicate a negative sentiment around Apple's stock in the near term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a fall and 0.3 to 0.5 for a rise.

(AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, calling it a 'wildcard to the downside' and suggesting that it may not have a good quarter. He also mentions the potential impact of the Chinese economy on Apple, which adds to the downside risk. While Cramer's tone is somewhat mitigated by his advice to 'own them, don't trade them,' the overall sentiment expressed is negative. Additionally, previous predictions from various models exhibit a wide range of probabilities, but many lean towards a higher chance of the stock price falling due to concerns about iPhone sales and Apple's exposure to the Chinese market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news does not contain any direct information related to Apple Inc.

Since there is no relevant information about Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on its stock price.

While some models suggest a more favorable regulatory stance towards tech companies, the core information does not directly relate to Apple's financial performance or strategic decisions. Several predictions across different models show a mix of sentiments, with the majority predicting a slight to moderate negative sentiment. Considering the ambiguity and mixed signals from various sources, along with the lack of specific actionable information related to Apple, the estimated probabilities remain relatively neutral but tilt marginally towards a decline.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news suggests a more conciliatory relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, primarily indicated by the attendance of Apple's CEO at the inauguration. This could imply reduced regulatory pressure on tech companies, which may positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, there are significant concerns stemming from analysts' negative commentary about Apple's performance and the potential impact of global economic factors, particularly relating to China. Given the mixed signals and a predominance of negative sentiment from analysts in previous assessments, I estimate a modest probability of the stock price rising, but with a slightly higher probability of it falling due to prevailing uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration, while other Big Tech CEOs are attending. This has little direct impact on Apple. Previous rounds show varied sentiment: some initially saw potential regulatory shifts as positive, while others cited Jim Cramer's negative views on Apple, irrespective of the inauguration. Later rounds recognized the limited direct impact of the news and converged towards neutral or slightly negative predictions due to existing negative sentiment. Considering the lack of direct impact and the overall trend in previous predictions, a slightly negative effect is most likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on an individual investor's reflection on past investing mistakes, with Apple mentioned as an example of complacency.

Previous predictions show wide divergence, highlighting the minimal impact of this article on Apple's stock.  The consistent lack of direct, Apple-specific information across the various rounds leads me to conclude that the news is unlikely to significantly influence the stock price in either direction.  The probabilities should therefore reflect a near-neutral state.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Jim Cramer's negative sentiment towards Apple Inc.
