A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, particularly with Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This may signal a more favorable stance towards tech companies in the near future, potentially leading to positive sentiment in the market for Apple. Additionally, the mention of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech could introduce uncertainty, but the overall tone suggests a potential easing of tensions. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is greater than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned trip to China and Taiwan. It also mentions other Big Tech CEOs attending and discusses Big Tech's relationship with Trump. This news item doesn't directly or significantly impact Apple. The attendance or non-attendance of other tech leaders at an inauguration, or the relationship between other tech companies and the president have very little direct bearing upon Apple's business or stock performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed and that the assumption of continued boom times is unwarranted.  The author's self-critique doesn't present any new negative information specific to Apple; instead, it highlights the need for continued diligence in evaluating even seemingly strong, established companies.  The article's focus is on the author's personal investing strategy and mistakes; it does not contain any market-moving information about Apple itself (e.g., new product announcements, changes in management, or significant financial news). Therefore the news is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in either direction.  The probability of a price increase or decrease is largely dependent on other market factors rather than the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock is vulnerable to iPhone sales reports, which account for a significant portion of its revenue. He also notes that there is widespread belief that Apple might report a weaker quarter, which could lead to a downside surprise. Additionally, Cramer highlights the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple, suggesting potential risks due to China's hostile stance. These factors collectively indicate a negative sentiment around Apple's stock in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that Apple's stock is a 'wildcard to the downside' and that he doesn't think Apple will have a good quarter. He also mentions that many research pieces indicate Apple could surprise to the downside, implying a potential negative impact on the stock price. However, Cramer also advises to 'own them, don't trade them,' which might mitigate some of the negative impact. Overall, the tone suggests more downside risk than upside potential in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news does not contain any information directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The news discusses the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump and the attendance of various Big Tech executives, including the absence of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Since there is no relevant information about Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
