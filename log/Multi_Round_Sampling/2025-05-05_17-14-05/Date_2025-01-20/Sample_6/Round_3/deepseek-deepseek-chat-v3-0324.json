(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump\u2019s inauguration can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, being part of a political event may signal alignment with potential pro-business policies or initiatives that could positively affect the stock market sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. On the other hand, political events can also introduce uncertainty and potential backlash depending on public perception. Given the context and Apple's status as a leading tech company, the overall sentiment seems more inclined towards a positive market reaction, though cautious due to political affiliations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's past investing mistakes and specifically mentions Apple as a company they've held for a long time, but have become somewhat complacent about. While the author acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, existing products), they also point out that its growth has slowed down compared to other companies, and it faces headwinds. This suggests a more neutral perspective on Apple's future performance, as past high growth rates are recognized as potentially unsustainable. The article does not mention any other negative aspects about the short/mid-term performance. \n\nThe fact that the author holds a position long-term, and the article suggests that it is still a favorable investment, tempers any strong expectations of decline. The call to action is diligence instead of selling, suggesting that there may be positive change in the future. The 'Double Down' promotional element at the end of the article is also not specific to Apple and thus does not significantly affect the analysis.\n\nTaking everything into account, I'm assuming slightly greater probability that the stock price might decrease minimally in the very short term due to highlighting potentially less sensational growth, but the overall investment thesis, however, remains favorable in the longer term. This analysis takes into consideration that the average retail investor does not read investment articles deeply, and will see the term 'complacency' as a negative signal rather than a cause for deeper analysis of fundamentals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concerns about the overreliance on iPhone sales, anticipates a potential negative surprise in the next quarter, and refers to Apple as a 'wildcard to the downside'. While he acknowledges the potential for Apple's AI innovations, his overall tone suggests a pessimistic outlook.  The article mentions other analysts also expecting a downside surprise, making a negative movement more likely. The fact that Cramer comments on the stock having already underperformed since the year began further reinforces the downward trend suggestion. However, Apple's position as a generally strong company and the high number of hedge fund holders (158) suggest some resilience to a significant fall.  Therefore, a probability leaning towards a fall is assigned, but not overwhelmingly so, recognizing the possibility of a counter-trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, highlighting a potential shift from past tensions to a more collaborative stance, as evidenced by major tech executives attending his inauguration. Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook's presence at the event could be interpreted as a positive signal for the company's relationship with the new administration, potentially reducing regulatory risks. This development may boost investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases, which could pose risks. Overall, the positive sentiment from the improved relationship likely outweighs the potential negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. This development could be viewed positively by investors, as it may indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple and other Big Tech companies. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Overall, the news seems to have a slightly positive tone for Apple, as it implies a potential easing of tensions between the company and the Trump administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline states that Jim Cramer believes Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a 'wildcard to the downside', implying that the stock price may decline. Additionally, Cramer mentions that many analysts think Apple could surprise to the downside, which suggests a potential decline in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that Cramer also advises to 'own, don't trade' Apple stocks, which may indicate some level of confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Overall, the negative sentiment expressed by Cramer and the potential for a decline in iPhone sales contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions key figures from major tech companies, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook. While the attendance of tech executives at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive signal, the article also highlights ongoing challenges and potential consolidations in the tech industry, which could negatively impact Apple's stock. The broader context of legal challenges and antitrust concerns adds further uncertainty. Without clear signals pointing to specific positive outcomes for Apple, the balance leans towards neutral to negative sentiments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Donald Trump's inauguration signals a potential thaw in relations between the tech industry and the new administration, possibly indicating a more favorable regulatory environment. This positive development may boost investor confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, the continuing challenges of legal scrutiny for Big Tech companies and mixed sentiments from analysts create a balanced outlook. Considering the previous predictions and analysis trends, I estimate a moderate probability of an upward movement in stock price, tempered by lingering concerns regarding regulatory issues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is from The Motley Fool and discusses personal investment mistakes, using Apple as an example of complacency. While the author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and established products, they point out that the company's growth has slowed down compared to others, and it faces headwinds due to market penetration and competition. The article does not explicitly say to sell the stock, but it does mention the need for increased diligence even when there are not any major changes. This suggests a neutral to slightly negative perspective on Apple's short-term performance. Considering previous predictions, there's a slight bearish trend. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses heavily on Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple. He describes it as a 'wildcard to the downside' and anticipates a disappointing quarter.  This negative sentiment is further reinforced by the mention of other analysts sharing similar expectations of a downside surprise. While Cramer's advice to 'own, don't trade' suggests some long-term faith, the immediate impact of his overwhelmingly negative comments and the anticipation of poor quarterly results points towards a higher probability of a price drop. The high number of hedge fund holders (158) suggests some resilience, preventing an extremely sharp decline.  However, the consensus among analysts and the prominent negative commentary outweigh any potential for a positive market reaction based on this specific news.  The previous predictions show a mixed bag of opinions, with some leaning toward a rise and others toward a fall, but the weight of Cramer's negative assessment sways the probability more towards a fall. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration, which could signal improved relations and potentially favorable regulatory conditions. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The mixed signals from the news suggest a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, but uncertainty remains due to political and regulatory factors. Considering the previous predictions, which leaned towards a positive outlook but with caution, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This could be seen as a positive signal, potentially reducing regulatory risks and boosting investor confidence. However, the article also highlights ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases, which could pose risks. Considering the mixed sentiments and the previous predictions from various models, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly towards a positive market reaction, but with caution due to political affiliations and potential legal challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's negative commentary on Apple Inc. (AAPL), referring to it as a 'wildcard to the downside'. Cramer expresses concerns about the company's overreliance on iPhone sales and anticipates a potential negative surprise in the next quarter. However, it's worth noting that Cramer advises to 'own, don't trade' Apple stocks, which may indicate some level of confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world and has a high number of hedge fund holders (158), which suggests some resilience to a significant fall. Considering the negative sentiment expressed by Cramer and the potential for a decline in iPhone sales, but also taking into account the company's strong position and potential for long-term growth, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and the attendance of tech executives, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, at his inauguration. This suggests efforts to improve relations with the administration, which could positively affect investor sentiment. However, the news also highlights ongoing legal challenges and antitrust concerns, creating mixed signals. Previous predictions from various models suggest a mix of positive and negative sentiments, with a slight tilt towards a cautious bullish outlook. Considering these factors, the most probable outcome leans towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Donald Trump's inauguration suggests a potential easing of tensions between Big Tech and the new administration, which may create a more favorable regulatory environment. Some predictions show a moderate inclination towards positive sentiment based on this development. However, there are also concerns about ongoing legal challenges facing Big Tech, including antitrust issues, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Overall, while there are mixed signals, the probable outcome leans slightly towards a rise in stock price due to the signal of improved relationships with the government despite existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's past mistakes, highlighting a period of complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strengths, the author points out slower growth and market saturation challenges. However, the investor is not selling, but resolving to be more diligent, which suggests neither panic nor necessarily negative expectations, but a more watchful approach. The previous round's models show a slight bearish trend. Given that the article highlights areas of concern but doesn't outright recommend selling, I predict a near-equal probability of the stock price rising or falling, but the admission of slowed growth tips it slightly towards the negative. Importantly, the 'Double Down' recommendation, while not directly about AAPL, could indicate positive expectations from the source of the article (Motley Fool), which balances out the concerns somewhat. Also, the fact that the author is taking a more diligent approach may hint at future possibilities.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple. He labels AAPL a 'wildcard to the downside' and anticipates a disappointing quarter, citing concerns about over-reliance on iPhone sales and a general sense that the stock is overvalued.  This negative sentiment is echoed by other analysts mentioned in the article. While Cramer's 'own, don't trade' advice suggests some long-term confidence, the short-term impact of his overwhelmingly negative assessment is likely to outweigh any long-term bullish sentiment, especially given the current market mood.  The high number of hedge fund holders does suggest some inherent resilience, preventing an extreme price drop.  However, the consistent negativity from multiple sources, along with the prior predictions that show a bias to a price fall, significantly increases the probability of a price decrease in the near term.  The positive news around Trump's administration is not strongly linked to Apple and appears less impactful than the immediate concerns raised by Cramer's commentary.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential improvement in the relationship between Apple and the Trump administration, as evidenced by Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This could signal reduced regulatory risks and a more favorable business environment, which may positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks and create uncertainty. Previous predictions from various models show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, with a slight tilt towards a cautious bullish outlook. Considering these factors, the most probable outcome leans towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, with the potential for regulatory easing slightly outweighing the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration, which could signal improved relations and potentially favorable regulatory conditions. However, it also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech, posing risks. Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning towards a positive outlook due to improved relations with the administration, while others express caution due to legal challenges and negative analyst commentary. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising seems slightly higher than falling, but with significant caution due to the mixed signals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's negative commentary on Apple Inc. (AAPL), referring to it as a 'wildcard to the downside'. Cramer expresses concerns about the company's overreliance on iPhone sales and anticipates a potential negative surprise in the next quarter. However, the article also mentions that Apple is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world and has a high number of hedge fund holders (158), which suggests some resilience to a significant fall. Considering the negative sentiment expressed by Cramer and the potential for a decline in iPhone sales, but also taking into account the company's strong position and potential for long-term growth, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and the attendance of tech executives, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, at his inauguration.
