(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump\u2019s inauguration can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, being part of a political event may signal alignment with potential pro-business policies or initiatives that could positively affect the stock market sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. On the other hand, political events can also introduce uncertainty and potential backlash depending on public perception. Given the context and Apple's status as a leading tech company, the overall sentiment seems more inclined towards a positive market reaction, though cautious due to political affiliations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's past investing mistakes and specifically mentions Apple as a company they've held for a long time, but have become somewhat complacent about. While the author acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, existing products), they also point out that its growth has slowed down compared to other companies, and it faces headwinds. This suggests a more neutral perspective on Apple's future performance, as past high growth rates are recognized as potentially unsustainable. The article does not mention any other negative aspects about the short/mid-term performance. \n\nThe fact that the author holds a position long-term, and the article suggests that it is still a favorable investment, tempers any strong expectations of decline. The call to action is diligence instead of selling, suggesting that there may be positive change in the future. The 'Double Down' promotional element at the end of the article is also not specific to Apple and thus does not significantly affect the analysis.\n\nTaking everything into account, I'm assuming slightly greater probability that the stock price might decrease minimally in the very short term due to highlighting potentially less sensational growth, but the overall investment thesis, however, remains favorable in the longer term. This analysis takes into consideration that the average retail investor does not read investment articles deeply, and will see the term 'complacency' as a negative signal rather than a cause for deeper analysis of fundamentals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concerns about the overreliance on iPhone sales, anticipates a potential negative surprise in the next quarter, and refers to Apple as a 'wildcard to the downside'. While he acknowledges the potential for Apple's AI innovations, his overall tone suggests a pessimistic outlook.  The article mentions other analysts also expecting a downside surprise, making a negative movement more likely. The fact that Cramer comments on the stock having already underperformed since the year began further reinforces the downward trend suggestion. However, Apple's position as a generally strong company and the high number of hedge fund holders (158) suggest some resilience to a significant fall.  Therefore, a probability leaning towards a fall is assigned, but not overwhelmingly so, recognizing the possibility of a counter-trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, highlighting a potential shift from past tensions to a more collaborative stance, as evidenced by major tech executives attending his inauguration. Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook's presence at the event could be interpreted as a positive signal for the company's relationship with the new administration, potentially reducing regulatory risks. This development may boost investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases, which could pose risks. Overall, the positive sentiment from the improved relationship likely outweighs the potential negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. This development could be viewed positively by investors, as it may indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple and other Big Tech companies. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Overall, the news seems to have a slightly positive tone for Apple, as it implies a potential easing of tensions between the company and the Trump administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline states that Jim Cramer believes Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a 'wildcard to the downside', implying that the stock price may decline. Additionally, Cramer mentions that many analysts think Apple could surprise to the downside, which suggests a potential decline in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that Cramer also advises to 'own, don't trade' Apple stocks, which may indicate some level of confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Overall, the negative sentiment expressed by Cramer and the potential for a decline in iPhone sales contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions key figures from major tech companies, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook. While the attendance of tech executives at Trump's inauguration could be seen as a positive signal, the article also highlights ongoing challenges and potential consolidations in the tech industry, which could negatively impact Apple's stock. The broader context of legal challenges and antitrust concerns adds further uncertainty. Without clear signals pointing to specific positive outcomes for Apple, the balance leans towards neutral to negative sentiments.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
