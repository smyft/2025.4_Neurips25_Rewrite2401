A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis of Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on potential vulnerabilities related to its reliance on iPhone sales and speculation about a disappointing quarterly performance. Cramer's mention of the 'wildcard to the downside' indicates concerns about negative surprises, which could lead to stock price declines. Overall, sources suggest that a significant number of analysts expect a downside surprise, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Given this context, the probabilities lean towards a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned trip to China and Taiwan. It also mentions other Big Tech CEOs attending and discusses Big Tech's relationship with Trump. This news item doesn't directly or significantly impact Apple. The attendance or non-attendance of other tech leaders at an inauguration, or the relationship between other tech companies and the president have very little direct bearing upon Apple's business or stock performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed and that the assumption of continued boom times is unwarranted.  The author's self-critique doesn't predict a fall, but suggests a need for increased diligence and reevaluation of the investment thesis, implying the probability of significant upward price movement is reduced compared to the author's prior relatively passive approach.  The news itself is not directly bearish, but rather highlights a need for more active management of an existing investment.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered low, while the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, but lower than might be assumed based on past performance alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, specifically mentioning Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This could be interpreted as a positive signal for Apple, suggesting a more favorable political environment or reduced regulatory risks. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The attendance of tech executives at the inauguration might be seen as a strategic move to mitigate these risks. Overall, the news leans slightly positive for Apple, but the impact is uncertain due to the broader regulatory context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO attending President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The attendance of the CEO at a political event does not inherently provide specific information that would directly influence Apple's stock price in a clear direction. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, considering the nature of the event and the involvement of tech leaders, there might be a slight positive perception if investors believe this could lead to favorable tech policies. Nonetheless, this is speculative and not directly actionable. Hence, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive implications for the tech sector, but it's still a relatively neutral piece of news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article provided does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or have any direct relation to the company's financials, products, or operations. The article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and specifically mentions Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip. Since there is no relevant information about Apple Inc., the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is minimal and can be considered neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments about Apple suggest a bearish outlook, mentioning concerns regarding the company's reliance on iPhone sales and the potential for disappointing quarterly performance. The phrase 'wildcard to the downside' indicates a strong possibility of negative surprises. Additionally, the prevalent sentiment from analysts leaning towards a downside surprise reinforces the bearish tone. While there are mixed predictions from various models, the overall context of the news indicates more downside risk for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration, with Nvidia CEO's absence highlighted. While Apple isn't directly mentioned, the overall tone suggests potentially improved relations between the tech sector and the new administration. Tim Cook's potential presence (implied) might signal a willingness to engage, which could be perceived as slightly positive for Apple, mitigating regulatory risks. However, the impact is indirect and uncertain. Considering the previous round predictions, I'll adjust my probabilities based on the previous reasoning, particularly the idea of Trump's potential policy impacts on the tech sector.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example.  The author reflects on their own complacency regarding Apple's continued growth, noting that while impressive, Apple's growth rate has slowed.  This self-critique highlights a need for more active monitoring rather than assuming continued success.  The article doesn't present any negative news about Apple's performance or prospects.  Considering that the analysis focuses on a personal investing mistake and doesn't reveal any new negative information about the company, there is no strong indication of an imminent price drop. The probability of a price increase is also not significantly boosted, as the news itself is not positive, but instead a call for careful consideration of the investment.  The previous predictions show varying opinions with a slight bias towards a belief that the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, although with a low confidence. Considering all of this, a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall is assigned, reflecting the lack of negative news and some existing positive sentiment reflected in previous predictions but moderated by the author's acknowledgment of needing to more actively monitor the investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, highlighting the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration. This could be interpreted as a positive signal, suggesting potential favorable political or regulatory conditions for Apple. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The attendance of tech executives might be seen as a strategic move to mitigate these risks. Overall, the news has a slightly positive tone for Apple, but the impact is uncertain due to the broader regulatory context. Considering the mixed signals and the neutral to slightly positive nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The article does not provide any direct information about Apple's financials, products, or operations. The attendance of the CEO at a political event could be perceived as a neutral or slightly positive signal, as it may suggest a good relationship with the administration, potentially leading to favorable tech policies. However, this is speculative and not directly actionable. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention or relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and specifically mentions Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence. Since the news does not contain any relevant information about Apple Inc., the impact on its stock price is likely to be neutral. Considering the lack of direct relation and the neutral nature of the news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be equal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, specifically highlighting Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. While there might be a perception of a more favorable political environment or reduced regulatory risks, this is tempered by ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases against Big Tech mentioned in the news. Previous predictions from various models suggest mixed views, ranging from neutral to slightly positive impacts on Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
