The attendance of the CEO at a political event does not inherently provide specific information that would directly influence Apple's stock price in a clear direction. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, considering the nature of the event and the involvement of tech leaders, there might be a slight positive perception if investors believe this could lead to favorable tech policies. Nonetheless, this is speculative and not directly actionable. Hence, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive implications for the tech sector, but it's still a relatively neutral piece of news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
