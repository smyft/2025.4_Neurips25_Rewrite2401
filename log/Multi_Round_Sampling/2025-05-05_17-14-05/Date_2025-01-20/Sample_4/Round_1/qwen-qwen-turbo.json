      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis of Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on potential vulnerabilities related to its reliance on iPhone sales and speculation about a disappointing quarterly performance. Cramer's mention of the 'wildcard to the downside' indicates concerns about negative surprises, which could lead to stock price declines. Overall, sources suggest that a significant number of analysts expect a downside surprise, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Given this context, the probabilities lean towards a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned trip to China and Taiwan. It also mentions other Big Tech CEOs attending and discusses Big Tech's relationship with Trump. This news item doesn't directly or significantly impact Apple. The attendance or non-attendance of other tech leaders at an inauguration, or the relationship between other tech companies and the president have very little direct bearing upon Apple's business or stock performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed and that the assumption of continued boom times is unwarranted.  The author's self-critique doesn't predict a fall, but suggests a need for increased diligence and reevaluation of the investment thesis, implying the probability of significant upward price movement is reduced compared to the author's prior relatively passive approach.  The news itself is not directly bearish, but rather highlights a need for more active management of an existing investment.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered low, while the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, but lower than might be assumed based on past performance alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, specifically mentioning Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This could be interpreted as a positive signal for Apple, suggesting a more favorable political environment or reduced regulatory risks. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The attendance of tech executives at the inauguration might be seen as a strategic move to mitigate these risks. Overall, the news leans slightly positive for Apple, but the impact is uncertain due to the broader regulatory context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO attending President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The attendance of the CEO at a political event does not inherently provide specific information that would directly influence Apple's stock price in a clear direction. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, considering the nature of the event and the involvement of tech leaders, there might be a slight positive perception if investors believe this could lead to favorable tech policies. Nonetheless, this is speculative and not directly actionable. Hence, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive implications for the tech sector, but it's still a relatively neutral piece of news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article provided does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or have any direct relation to the company's financials, products, or operations. The article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and specifically mentions Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip. Since there is no relevant information about Apple Inc., the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is minimal and can be considered neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
