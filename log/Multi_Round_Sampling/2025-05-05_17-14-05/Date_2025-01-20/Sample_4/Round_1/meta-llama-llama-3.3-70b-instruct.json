A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis of Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on potential vulnerabilities related to its reliance on iPhone sales and speculation about a disappointing quarterly performance. Cramer's mention of the 'wildcard to the downside' indicates concerns about negative surprises, which could lead to stock price declines. Overall, sources suggest that a significant number of analysts expect a downside surprise, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Given this context, the probabilities lean towards a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned trip to China and Taiwan. It also mentions other Big Tech CEOs attending and discusses Big Tech's relationship with Trump. This news item doesn't directly or significantly impact Apple. The attendance or non-attendance of other tech leaders at an inauguration, or the relationship between other tech companies and the president have very little direct bearing upon Apple's business or stock performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed and that the assumption of continued boom times is unwarranted.  The author's self-critique doesn't predict a fall, but suggests a need for increased diligence and reevaluation of the investment thesis, implying the probability of significant upward price movement is reduced compared to the author's prior relatively passive approach.  The news itself is not directly bearish, but rather highlights a need for more active management of an existing investment.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered low, while the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, but lower than might be assumed based on past performance alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, specifically mentioning Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This could be interpreted as a positive signal for Apple, suggesting a more favorable political environment or reduced regulatory risks. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases against Big Tech, which could pose risks. The attendance of tech executives at the inauguration might be seen as a strategic move to mitigate these risks. Overall, the news leans slightly positive for Apple, but the impact is uncertain due to the broader regulatory context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO attending President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The attendance of the CEO at a political event does not inherently provide specific information that would directly influence Apple's stock price in a clear direction. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, considering the nature of the event and the involvement of tech leaders, there might be a slight positive perception if investors believe this could lead to favorable tech policies. Nonetheless, this is speculative and not directly actionable. Hence, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive implications for the tech sector, but it's still a relatively neutral piece of news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article provided does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or have any direct relation to the company's financials, products, or operations. The article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and specifically mentions Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip. Since there is no relevant information about Apple Inc., the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is minimal and can be considered neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
