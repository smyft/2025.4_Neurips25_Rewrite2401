(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses investing mistakes and reflections on past performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author expresses a positive long-term view on Apple's brand and growth, despite acknowledging that its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. This analysis indicates a cautious optimism about Apple's future, suggesting that investors remain generally confident in the company's ability to continue growing, though there are headwinds to consider. Thus, the probabilities for stock price movement are slightly more favorable towards a rise than a fall, but there is also recognition of potential stagnation or decline in growth rates given market competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Trump's inauguration. This event, in itself, is not definitively positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market reaction will largely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their potential impact on Apple. Generally, market stability or perceived pro-business policies could be seen as favorable. However, any perceived alignment with potentially controversial policies could alienate parts of Apple's consumer base. The market also reacts to the general sentiment towards 'Big Tech' at any given point in time. Since the news is primarily observational (attendance at an inauguration), and the immediate market reaction is often based on speculation, a moderate impact on the stock is anticipated. Assuming no major policy announcements immediately following the inauguration have a large impact, a slight positive bias is factored due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, because the information provided has nothing to do with Apple's earnings, the likelihood of a major shift in stock price is minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a neutral event with no clear positive or negative implications for Apple's stock price.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration affecting tech companies, the news itself provides no concrete indication of such changes or their impact on Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with some slight skew towards neutral movement due to the lack of strong directional signals in the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, particularly in relation to iPhone sales and the Chinese economy. Cramer mentions that Apple might not have a good quarter and that there is widespread belief that the stock could surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the mention of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside', suggests a bearish outlook. However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of various Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, specifically noting that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be attending due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any information that could directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is neutral with respect to Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. The presence of Apple's CEO at the inauguration could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive sign, as it may indicate a more collaborative approach between the company and the administration. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be fairly balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate directly to AAPL, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses investment mistakes and reflections on the author's investment strategies regarding Apple Inc. It indicates a cautious optimism towards Apple's long-term growth potential, despite recognizing potential headwinds and slower growth in certain segments. The author acknowledges the necessity to remain vigilant and reassess their investment thesis regularly. While there is no strong negative news, the recognition of competitors' growth and market saturation suggests some caution among investors. Overall, the sentiment is slightly positive, but with acknowledgment of risks. Therefore, I estimate a small probability for the stock price to rise and a moderately higher probability for it to fall due to market competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of various Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, on its own, is neither distinctly positive nor negative for Apple's stock. The market's response hinges on investor sentiment towards Trump's potential policies and their implications for Apple. A perceived favorable regulatory environment or business-friendly policies could be viewed positively. However, associating with potentially divisive policies might alienate portions of Apple's customer base. Although the presence of Apple's CEO suggests an effort to maintain a constructive relationship with the administration, the absence of specific policy changes or direct impacts on Apple makes substantial stock price movement unlikely. Given prior rounds, there's a slight tendency for assessments towards neutral-to-slightly positive influences, with the event largely seen as observational. Considering the existing trends and acknowledging the inherently speculative nature of market reactions, I predict a marginally lower probability of a price rise compared to the average in the previous round to account for the possibility of no significant changes to Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is largely a neutral event with no direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration, the news itself offers no specifics. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, from a slight bias towards a price rise to a roughly even chance of rise or fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  The absence of concrete information coupled with the generally neutral nature of the event leads me to conclude that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. The slight consensus toward a higher probability of rise in earlier rounds likely stems from a hope for political stability and/or pro-business policies. However, this is purely speculative and unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, particularly in relation to iPhone sales and the Chinese economy. Cramer mentions that Apple might not have a good quarter and that there is widespread belief that the stock could surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the mention of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside', suggests a bearish outlook. However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated. Previous predictions also indicate a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to the concerns raised by Cramer.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the varied predictions from other models, a balanced estimation with a slight lean towards a neutral stance is reasonable. The fact that other models have predicted a range of probabilities suggests that there is no clear consensus on the direction of the stock price movement, which further supports a balanced estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The majority of other predictions suggest a neutral stance on the news, with some predictions leaning slightly positive or negative, reflecting the mixed sentiments around Big Tech's relationship with Trump and his policies. There is no substantial evidence provided in the news article that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, my prediction leans towards the neutral stance with a slight positive skew considering historical positive relations between Apple's leadership and the administration.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights several subtle investing mistakes made in the past and emphasizes the importance of due diligence, especially concerning Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author maintains a positive long-term view on Apple, they recognize potential headwinds and competition which might limit growth. The overall sentiment reflects cautious optimism, but acknowledges the necessity for ongoing evaluation of the investment thesis. Given the mixed sentiment in previous predictions and the cautious outlook presented, I estimate a probability of a slight rise in stock price due to the recognition of Apple\u2019s strengths and brand value, but also a substantial chance of a decline reflecting investor awareness of competition and market saturation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. This event, by itself, isn't inherently positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market's reaction depends on investor sentiment toward Trump's policies and their potential impact on tech companies. While the CEO's presence could signal an effort to maintain a working relationship, there's no concrete information in the news about specific policy changes or direct effects on Apple. The trend in previous rounds leans towards neutral to slightly positive, with the event seen more as observational. Considering the history of mixed reactions to Trump's relationship with the Tech sector, any significant stock price movement is unlikely. Taking into account all the information and the trend of previous predictions and information provided, I predict the market will most likely show no directional change, indicating balance between market sentiments. Hence, I assign a slight bias towards the rise and a slightly higher value towards the fall. Therefore, the chances the stock price would rise are slightly more favorable than it would fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 inauguration. This event is largely neutral, with no direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.  While speculation exists regarding potential policy changes under a Trump administration, the news itself provides no specifics.  Previous predictions show a wide range, highlighting the uncertainty.  The lack of concrete information suggests a low probability of significant price movement.  A slight positive bias is present in some previous predictions, possibly reflecting hopes for political stability or pro-business policies. However, this is speculative and unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock. Considering the overall neutrality of the news and the varied previous predictions which mostly center around a neutral probability, I am assigning a nearly equal probability of a price rise or fall, with a slight lean towards neutrality.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

This negative sentiment, combined with the mention of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside', suggests a bearish outlook. However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated. Previous predictions also indicate a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to the concerns raised by Cramer. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any information that could directly impact Apple's stock price. Given that the news is neutral with respect to Apple and does not provide any concrete indications of policy changes or their impact on the company, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is low. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, but many lean towards a neutral stance or a slight positive bias due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, without direct implications for Apple, a balanced estimation with a slight lean towards a neutral stance is reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc.
