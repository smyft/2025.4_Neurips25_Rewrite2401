(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses investing mistakes and reflections on past performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author expresses a positive long-term view on Apple's brand and growth, despite acknowledging that its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. This analysis indicates a cautious optimism about Apple's future, suggesting that investors remain generally confident in the company's ability to continue growing, though there are headwinds to consider. Thus, the probabilities for stock price movement are slightly more favorable towards a rise than a fall, but there is also recognition of potential stagnation or decline in growth rates given market competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Trump's inauguration. This event, in itself, is not definitively positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market reaction will largely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their potential impact on Apple. Generally, market stability or perceived pro-business policies could be seen as favorable. However, any perceived alignment with potentially controversial policies could alienate parts of Apple's consumer base. The market also reacts to the general sentiment towards 'Big Tech' at any given point in time. Since the news is primarily observational (attendance at an inauguration), and the immediate market reaction is often based on speculation, a moderate impact on the stock is anticipated. Assuming no major policy announcements immediately following the inauguration have a large impact, a slight positive bias is factored due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, because the information provided has nothing to do with Apple's earnings, the likelihood of a major shift in stock price is minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a neutral event with no clear positive or negative implications for Apple's stock price.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration affecting tech companies, the news itself provides no concrete indication of such changes or their impact on Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with some slight skew towards neutral movement due to the lack of strong directional signals in the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, particularly in relation to iPhone sales and the Chinese economy. Cramer mentions that Apple might not have a good quarter and that there is widespread belief that the stock could surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the mention of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside', suggests a bearish outlook. However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of various Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, specifically noting that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be attending due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any information that could directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is neutral with respect to Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. The presence of Apple's CEO at the inauguration could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive sign, as it may indicate a more collaborative approach between the company and the administration. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be fairly balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate directly to AAPL, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses investment mistakes and reflections on the author's investment strategies regarding Apple Inc. It indicates a cautious optimism towards Apple's long-term growth potential, despite recognizing potential headwinds and slower growth in certain segments. The author acknowledges the necessity to remain vigilant and reassess their investment thesis regularly. While there is no strong negative news, the recognition of competitors' growth and market saturation suggests some caution among investors. Overall, the sentiment is slightly positive, but with acknowledgment of risks. Therefore, I estimate a small probability for the stock price to rise and a moderately higher probability for it to fall due to market competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of various Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, on its own, is neither distinctly positive nor negative for Apple's stock. The market's response hinges on investor sentiment towards Trump's potential policies and their implications for Apple. A perceived favorable regulatory environment or business-friendly policies could be viewed positively. However, associating with potentially divisive policies might alienate portions of Apple's customer base. Although the presence of Apple's CEO suggests an effort to maintain a constructive relationship with the administration, the absence of specific policy changes or direct impacts on Apple makes substantial stock price movement unlikely. Given prior rounds, there's a slight tendency for assessments towards neutral-to-slightly positive influences, with the event largely seen as observational. Considering the existing trends and acknowledging the inherently speculative nature of market reactions, I predict a marginally lower probability of a price rise compared to the average in the previous round to account for the possibility of no significant changes to Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is largely a neutral event with no direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration, the news itself offers no specifics. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, from a slight bias towards a price rise to a roughly even chance of rise or fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  The absence of concrete information coupled with the generally neutral nature of the event leads me to conclude that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. The slight consensus toward a higher probability of rise in earlier rounds likely stems from a hope for political stability and/or pro-business policies. However, this is purely speculative and unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, particularly in relation to iPhone sales and the Chinese economy. Cramer mentions that Apple might not have a good quarter and that there is widespread belief that the stock could surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the mention of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside', suggests a bearish outlook. However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated. Previous predictions also indicate a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to the concerns raised by Cramer.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the varied predictions from other models, a balanced estimation with a slight lean towards a neutral stance is reasonable. The fact that other models have predicted a range of probabilities suggests that there is no clear consensus on the direction of the stock price movement, which further supports a balanced estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The majority of other predictions suggest a neutral stance on the news, with some predictions leaning slightly positive or negative, reflecting the mixed sentiments around Big Tech's relationship with Trump and his policies. There is no substantial evidence provided in the news article that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, my prediction leans towards the neutral stance with a slight positive skew considering historical positive relations between Apple's leadership and the administration.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights several subtle investing mistakes made in the past and emphasizes the importance of due diligence, especially concerning Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author maintains a positive long-term view on Apple, they recognize potential headwinds and competition which might limit growth. The overall sentiment reflects cautious optimism, but acknowledges the necessity for ongoing evaluation of the investment thesis. Given the mixed sentiment in previous predictions and the cautious outlook presented, I estimate a probability of a slight rise in stock price due to the recognition of Apple\u2019s strengths and brand value, but also a substantial chance of a decline reflecting investor awareness of competition and market saturation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. This event, by itself, isn't inherently positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market's reaction depends on investor sentiment toward Trump's policies and their potential impact on tech companies. While the CEO's presence could signal an effort to maintain a working relationship, there's no concrete information in the news about specific policy changes or direct effects on Apple. The trend in previous rounds leans towards neutral to slightly positive, with the event seen more as observational. Considering the history of mixed reactions to Trump's relationship with the Tech sector, any significant stock price movement is unlikely. Taking into account all the information and the trend of previous predictions and information provided, I predict the market will most likely show no directional change, indicating balance between market sentiments. Hence, I assign a slight bias towards the rise and a slightly higher value towards the fall. Therefore, the chances the stock price would rise are slightly more favorable than it would fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 inauguration. This event is largely neutral, with no direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.  While speculation exists regarding potential policy changes under a Trump administration, the news itself provides no specifics.  Previous predictions show a wide range, highlighting the uncertainty.  The lack of concrete information suggests a low probability of significant price movement.  A slight positive bias is present in some previous predictions, possibly reflecting hopes for political stability or pro-business policies. However, this is speculative and unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock. Considering the overall neutrality of the news and the varied previous predictions which mostly center around a neutral probability, I am assigning a nearly equal probability of a price rise or fall, with a slight lean towards neutrality.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

Given that the news is neutral with respect to Apple and does not provide any concrete indications of policy changes or their impact on the company, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is low. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, but many lean towards a neutral stance or a slight positive bias due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, without direct implications for Apple, a balanced estimation with a slight lean towards a neutral stance is reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc.
