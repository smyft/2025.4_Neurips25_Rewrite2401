A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses investing mistakes and reflections on past performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author expresses a positive long-term view on Apple's brand and growth, despite acknowledging that its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. This analysis indicates a cautious optimism about Apple's future, suggesting that investors remain generally confident in the company's ability to continue growing, though there are headwinds to consider. Thus, the probabilities for stock price movement are slightly more favorable towards a rise than a fall, but there is also recognition of potential stagnation or decline in growth rates given market competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Trump's inauguration. This event, in itself, is not definitively positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market reaction will largely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their potential impact on Apple. Generally, market stability or perceived pro-business policies could be seen as favorable. However, any perceived alignment with potentially controversial policies could alienate parts of Apple's consumer base. The market also reacts to the general sentiment towards 'Big Tech' at any given point in time. Since the news is primarily observational (attendance at an inauguration), and the immediate market reaction is often based on speculation, a moderate impact on the stock is anticipated. Assuming no major policy announcements immediately following the inauguration have a large impact, a slight positive bias is factored due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, because the information provided has nothing to do with Apple's earnings, the likelihood of a major shift in stock price is minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a neutral event with no clear positive or negative implications for Apple's stock price.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration affecting tech companies, the news itself provides no concrete indication of such changes or their impact on Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with some slight skew towards neutral movement due to the lack of strong directional signals in the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, particularly in relation to iPhone sales and the Chinese economy. Cramer mentions that Apple might not have a good quarter and that there is widespread belief that the stock could surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the mention of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside', suggests a bearish outlook. However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of various Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, specifically noting that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be attending due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any information that could directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is neutral with respect to Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. The presence of Apple's CEO at the inauguration could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive sign, as it may indicate a more collaborative approach between the company and the administration. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be fairly balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate directly to AAPL, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This is largely a neutral event with no direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration, the news itself offers no specifics. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, from a slight bias towards a price rise to a roughly even chance of rise or fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  The absence of concrete information coupled with the generally neutral nature of the event leads me to conclude that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. The slight consensus toward a higher probability of rise in earlier rounds likely stems from a hope for political stability and/or pro-business policies.
