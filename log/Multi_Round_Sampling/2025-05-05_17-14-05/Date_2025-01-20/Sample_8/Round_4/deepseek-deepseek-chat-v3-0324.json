(AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses investing mistakes and reflections on past performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author expresses a positive long-term view on Apple's brand and growth, despite acknowledging that its recent growth rates may not be as robust compared to faster-growing competitors. This analysis indicates a cautious optimism about Apple's future, suggesting that investors remain generally confident in the company's ability to continue growing, though there are headwinds to consider. Thus, the probabilities for stock price movement are slightly more favorable towards a rise than a fall, but there is also recognition of potential stagnation or decline in growth rates given market competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Trump's inauguration. This event, in itself, is not definitively positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market reaction will largely depend on investor sentiment towards Trump's policies and their potential impact on Apple. Generally, market stability or perceived pro-business policies could be seen as favorable. However, any perceived alignment with potentially controversial policies could alienate parts of Apple's consumer base. The market also reacts to the general sentiment towards 'Big Tech' at any given point in time. Since the news is primarily observational (attendance at an inauguration), and the immediate market reaction is often based on speculation, a moderate impact on the stock is anticipated. Assuming no major policy announcements immediately following the inauguration have a large impact, a slight positive bias is factored due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, because the information provided has nothing to do with Apple's earnings, the likelihood of a major shift in stock price is minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a neutral event with no clear positive or negative implications for Apple's stock price.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration affecting tech companies, the news itself provides no concrete indication of such changes or their impact on Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with some slight skew towards neutral movement due to the lack of strong directional signals in the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, particularly in relation to iPhone sales and the Chinese economy. Cramer mentions that Apple might not have a good quarter and that there is widespread belief that the stock could surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the mention of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside', suggests a bearish outlook. However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of various Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, specifically noting that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be attending due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any information that could directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is neutral with respect to Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. The presence of Apple's CEO at the inauguration could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive sign, as it may indicate a more collaborative approach between the company and the administration. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be fairly balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate directly to AAPL, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses investment mistakes and reflections on the author's investment strategies regarding Apple Inc. It indicates a cautious optimism towards Apple's long-term growth potential, despite recognizing potential headwinds and slower growth in certain segments. The author acknowledges the necessity to remain vigilant and reassess their investment thesis regularly. While there is no strong negative news, the recognition of competitors' growth and market saturation suggests some caution among investors. Overall, the sentiment is slightly positive, but with acknowledgment of risks. Therefore, I estimate a small probability for the stock price to rise and a moderately higher probability for it to fall due to market competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of various Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, on its own, is neither distinctly positive nor negative for Apple's stock. The market's response hinges on investor sentiment towards Trump's potential policies and their implications for Apple. A perceived favorable regulatory environment or business-friendly policies could be viewed positively. However, associating with potentially divisive policies might alienate portions of Apple's customer base. Although the presence of Apple's CEO suggests an effort to maintain a constructive relationship with the administration, the absence of specific policy changes or direct impacts on Apple makes substantial stock price movement unlikely. Given prior rounds, there's a slight tendency for assessments towards neutral-to-slightly positive influences, with the event largely seen as observational. Considering the existing trends and acknowledging the inherently speculative nature of market reactions, I predict a marginally lower probability of a price rise compared to the average in the previous round to account for the possibility of no significant changes to Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is largely a neutral event with no direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration, the news itself offers no specifics. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, from a slight bias towards a price rise to a roughly even chance of rise or fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  The absence of concrete information coupled with the generally neutral nature of the event leads me to conclude that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. The slight consensus toward a higher probability of rise in earlier rounds likely stems from a hope for political stability and/or pro-business policies. However, this is purely speculative and unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, particularly in relation to iPhone sales and the Chinese economy. Cramer mentions that Apple might not have a good quarter and that there is widespread belief that the stock could surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment, combined with the mention of Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside', suggests a bearish outlook. However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated. Previous predictions also indicate a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to the concerns raised by Cramer.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a positive relationship. However, the article does not provide any significant or direct information that would heavily impact Apple's stock price. Given the lack of concrete announcements or policy changes affecting Apple directly, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the varied predictions from other models, a balanced estimation with a slight lean towards a neutral stance is reasonable. The fact that other models have predicted a range of probabilities suggests that there is no clear consensus on the direction of the stock price movement, which further supports a balanced estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The majority of other predictions suggest a neutral stance on the news, with some predictions leaning slightly positive or negative, reflecting the mixed sentiments around Big Tech's relationship with Trump and his policies. There is no substantial evidence provided in the news article that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, my prediction leans towards the neutral stance with a slight positive skew considering historical positive relations between Apple's leadership and the administration.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights several subtle investing mistakes made in the past and emphasizes the importance of due diligence, especially concerning Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author maintains a positive long-term view on Apple, they recognize potential headwinds and competition which might limit growth. The overall sentiment reflects cautious optimism, but acknowledges the necessity for ongoing evaluation of the investment thesis. Given the mixed sentiment in previous predictions and the cautious outlook presented, I estimate a probability of a slight rise in stock price due to the recognition of Apple\u2019s strengths and brand value, but also a substantial chance of a decline reflecting investor awareness of competition and market saturation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. This event, by itself, isn't inherently positive or negative for Apple's stock. The market's reaction depends on investor sentiment toward Trump's policies and their potential impact on tech companies. While the CEO's presence could signal an effort to maintain a working relationship, there's no concrete information in the news about specific policy changes or direct effects on Apple. The trend in previous rounds leans towards neutral to slightly positive, with the event seen more as observational. Considering the history of mixed reactions to Trump's relationship with the Tech sector, any significant stock price movement is unlikely. Taking into account all the information and the trend of previous predictions and information provided, I predict the market will most likely show no directional change, indicating balance between market sentiments. Hence, I assign a slight bias towards the rise and a slightly higher value towards the fall. Therefore, the chances the stock price would rise are slightly more favorable than it would fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 inauguration. This event is largely neutral, with no direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.

Previous predictions show a wide range, highlighting the uncertainty.  The lack of concrete information suggests a low probability of significant price movement.  A slight positive bias is present in some previous predictions, possibly reflecting hopes for political stability or pro-business policies. However, this is speculative and unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock. Considering the overall neutrality of the news and the varied previous predictions which mostly center around a neutral probability, I am assigning a nearly equal probability of a price rise or fall, with a slight lean towards neutrality.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the stock's performance, particularly in relation to iPhone sales and the Chinese economy. Cramer mentions that Apple might not have a good quarter and that there is widespread belief that the stock could surprise to the downside.

However, Apple is a resilient company with a strong market position, so the negative impact might be somewhat mitigated. Previous predictions also indicate a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to the concerns raised by Cramer. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any information that could directly impact Apple's stock price. Given that the news is neutral with respect to Apple and does not provide any concrete indications of policy changes or their impact on the company, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is low. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, but many lean towards a neutral stance or a slight positive bias due to the potential for perceived stability or positive signaling to the business community. However, without direct implications for Apple, a balanced estimation with a slight lean towards a neutral stance is reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc.

The majority of other predictions suggest a neutral stance on the news, with some predictions leaning slightly positive or negative, reflecting the mixed sentiments around Big Tech's relationship with Trump and his policies. There is no substantial evidence provided in the news article that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, my prediction leans towards the neutral stance with a slight positive skew considering historical positive relations between Apple's leadership and the administration.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses subtle investing mistakes and reflections on the performance of Apple Inc., emphasizing the need for adaptive investment theses amidst changing market conditions and competition. While the author expresses a long-term positive view on Apple and acknowledges its strong brand, there is also recognition of potential headwinds and competitive pressures that could impact growth. This mixed sentiment suggests a slightly positive outlook, but with substantial caution about market conditions. Considering both this balanced view and previous model predictions, the probabilities indicate a higher chance of price stability, with a slight lean towards rising. Overall, the expectations for Apple's stock price movement reflect both optimism for its core strengths and caution towards competitive challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's 2025 inauguration. Attending the inauguration implies that Apple may seek to maintain a working relationship with the new administration. However, no policy changes or information directly affecting Apple is mentioned. Previous predictions are mixed, with some trending toward neutral or slightly positive sentiments due to the potential for stability. However, other negative feedback from earnings reports may indicate the stock is likely to fall. Moreover, it is difficult to gauge how pro- or anti- tech the new administration will be. I am assigning slightly higher probability that the stock price would fall, since the previous predictions have considered that Apple is trending toward negative earnings.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This event is largely considered neutral, with no direct impact on Apple's financials or operations. The market reaction will depend on broader investor sentiment towards Trump's potential policies and how those might impact tech companies.  Some might see it as a positive signal of cooperation or stability; others might view it negatively.  However, the news itself lacks concrete information regarding upcoming policies.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news.  Considering the lack of specific information, the relatively neutral nature of the event and the convergence of predictions towards a near-even split in later rounds suggests a minimal impact on the stock price.  A slight bias towards a price rise is observed in several predictions, possibly reflecting hopes for a business-friendly administration, but this is largely speculative.  Overall, I believe the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.
