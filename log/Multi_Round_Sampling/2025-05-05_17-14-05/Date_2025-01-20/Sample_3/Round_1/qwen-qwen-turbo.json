(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\nNews Content: As President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony is underway, many are taking note of the Silicon Valley personalities in attendance. Yahoo Finance host Rachelle Akuffo joins the program to acknowledge several of the Big Tech CEOs at Trump's swearing-in, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta Platforms' (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Apple (AAPL) chief executive, and even TikTok president Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAhead of the January 20 ceremony, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang stated he will be out of the country but \"look[s] forward to congratulating the Trump administration when they take office.\"\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, particularly with Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This may signal a more favorable stance towards tech companies in the near future, potentially leading to positive sentiment in the market for Apple. Additionally, the mention of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech could introduce uncertainty, but the overall tone suggests a more conciliatory approach. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising as investors may interpret this as a sign of better relations and less regulatory risk in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Nvidia's CEO and other Big Tech leaders attending or not attending Trump's inauguration. While it mentions Apple indirectly by its association to 'Big Tech', there's no direct impact or even significant implication for Apple's business operations, financial performance, or future prospects. The news is more related to political dynamics within the tech industry rather than anything fundamentally affecting Apple. Because this news doesn't even mention Apple directly, and has no direct implications for Apple, I believe movement would be either negligible or due to overall market trends completely unrelated to this news. Therefore the probability of stock price movement upward or downward would be almost equally likely, because it's likely that any price movement would be due to unrelated or different causes.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is irrelevant to Apple Inc. (AAPL).  The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but there is no connection to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have any significant impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the attendance of Apple's CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. This could be interpreted in two ways: 1) Positive sentiment if the market perceives closer ties between Big Tech and the new administration as beneficial for regulatory or policy outcomes. 2) Negative sentiment if the market views this as potential for increased scrutiny or regulatory pressure on Big Tech. Given the historical context of Trump's administration's mixed stance on Big Tech, the immediate market reaction is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as the presence of multiple CEOs suggests a collective effort to engage with the new administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency, noting that despite its strong brand and past performance, the company's growth may slow due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The news does not contain any directly negative or positive information about Apple's future performance but rather serves as a reminder to investors to stay vigilant. Given the neutral to slightly cautious tone regarding Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, but leaning towards a slight caution due to complacency concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and lessons learned, including not updating investment theses, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. Specifically, the author mentions their investment in Apple (AAPL) and how they assumed the company's success would continue without performing due diligence. The article does not provide any negative news or outlook for Apple, but rather emphasizes the importance of continuous evaluation and research. Given that the article does not contain any significantly bearish information about Apple, it is likely that the stock price will not be heavily impacted. However, the author's acknowledgement of potential headwinds and the need for diligence may lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence, resulting in a marginal probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news mentions Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration, which is unlikely to directly impact investor sentiment or company performance. There's no clear indication in the news that would cause a significant move in Apple's stock price. The event itself is more political than business-related, and no specific business decisions or company changes are mentioned.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
