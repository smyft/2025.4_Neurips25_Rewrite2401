(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, particularly with Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This may signal a more favorable stance towards tech companies in the near future, potentially leading to positive sentiment in the market for Apple. Additionally, the mention of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech could introduce uncertainty, but the overall tone suggests a more conciliatory approach. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising as investors may interpret this as a sign of better relations and less regulatory risk in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Nvidia's CEO and other Big Tech leaders attending or not attending Trump's inauguration. While it mentions Apple indirectly by its association to 'Big Tech', there's no direct impact or even significant implication for Apple's business operations, financial performance, or future prospects. The news is more related to political dynamics within the tech industry rather than anything fundamentally affecting Apple. Because this news doesn't even mention Apple directly, and has no direct implications for Apple, I believe movement would be either negligible or due to overall market trends completely unrelated to this news. Therefore the probability of stock price movement upward or downward would be almost equally likely, because it's likely that any price movement would be due to unrelated or different causes.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is irrelevant to Apple Inc. (AAPL).  The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but there is no connection to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have any significant impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the attendance of Apple's CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. This could be interpreted in two ways: 1) Positive sentiment if the market perceives closer ties between Big Tech and the new administration as beneficial for regulatory or policy outcomes. 2) Negative sentiment if the market views this as potential for increased scrutiny or regulatory pressure on Big Tech. Given the historical context of Trump's administration's mixed stance on Big Tech, the immediate market reaction is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as the presence of multiple CEOs suggests a collective effort to engage with the new administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency, noting that despite its strong brand and past performance, the company's growth may slow due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The news does not contain any directly negative or positive information about Apple's future performance but rather serves as a reminder to investors to stay vigilant. Given the neutral to slightly cautious tone regarding Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, but leaning towards a slight caution due to complacency concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and lessons learned, including not updating investment theses, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. Specifically, the author mentions their investment in Apple (AAPL) and how they assumed the company's success would continue without performing due diligence. The article does not provide any negative news or outlook for Apple, but rather emphasizes the importance of continuous evaluation and research. Given that the article does not contain any significantly bearish information about Apple, it is likely that the stock price will not be heavily impacted. However, the author's acknowledgement of potential headwinds and the need for diligence may lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence, resulting in a marginal probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news mentions Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration, which is unlikely to directly impact investor sentiment or company performance. There's no clear indication in the news that would cause a significant move in Apple's stock price. The event itself is more political than business-related, and no specific business decisions or company changes are mentioned.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, highlighting the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration. This could signal a potential improvement in relations between tech companies and the government, which might positively influence investor sentiment toward Apple. However, there is mention of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could still create some uncertainty. Taking into consideration the perspectives shared in previous predictions, where sentiments ranged from neutral to slightly positive regarding the potential benefits of improved relations, I assess a higher probability of a price rise rather than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and other tech CEOs who are attending. This has very little direct impact on Apple. The previous rounds show diverse interpretations, with some models incorrectly focusing on Apple's CEO attending (which isn't in the provided article) or interpreting general 'Big Tech' sentiment, most correctly assessed that this had very little implication for Apple. The early model gpt-4i-mini seems to give more importance to the relationship between Trump and big tech whereas in reality I think this news had negligble impact on apple. The prior round seems diverse in their initial predictions, with a slight tendency towards a 50/50 split between those correctly interpreting the impact as negligible to slightly positive depending how the relationship between Trump and big tech can be interpreted. Given the lack of new information and the correct interpretation trend of the previous models that this has negligible influence on apple and the general consensus in the precvious round, I predict the stock price is highly unlikely to shift in either direction, with a slight tendency upwards owing to the fact that a positive relationship with the adminestration is thought to be valuable. Because there is a general uncertainty, the split between rise and fall is not extreme.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO skipping Trump's inauguration, a political event with indirect relevance to the broader tech sector.  There's no direct mention of Apple or any specific impact on its business.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.1 to 0.65 probability of a price rise. This discrepancy highlights the low relevance of the news to Apple's stock price.  The most reasonable assumption is that the news will have a negligible impact, with any stock price movement being driven by broader market factors or other unrelated news.  The mixed predictions from previous models further support this neutral stance. I will therefore assign probabilities close to 0.5 for both rise and fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and the lack of a direct connection between the news and Apple's stock performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. This event is more political in nature and does not directly impact Apple's business operations, financial performance, or future prospects. While the presence of tech CEOs at the inauguration might signal a favorable stance towards Big Tech, the immediate market reaction is likely to be neutral. Given the lack of direct business implications, the stock price movement probabilities remain balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news article does not contain direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would significantly impact its stock price. The article discusses general investing mistakes and mentions Apple only as an example of complacency, noting that despite its strong brand, the company's growth may slow due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. Given the neutral to slightly cautious tone regarding Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The financial news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and lessons learned, including complacency, and mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an example. The article does not provide any directly negative or positive information about Apple's future performance but rather serves as a reminder to investors to stay vigilant. The author notes that despite Apple's strong brand and past performance, the company's growth may slow due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. Given the neutral to slightly cautious tone regarding Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration. Historically, the relationship between Trump and Big Tech has been mixed, with periods of both support and scrutiny. There's limited direct information suggesting a clear positive or negative impact on Apple's stock. Some past predictions suggest a slight positivity due to improved regulatory relations, others suggest neutrality or a slight negativity due to potential increased scrutiny. Considering these varied interpretations and the limited impact typically associated with such events, the probability of a significant rise or fall due to this news alone seems minimal.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, specifically highlighting Apple's CEO attendance at Trump's inauguration. This could signify a potential improvement in relations which might favorably influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, ongoing antitrust investigations present a level of uncertainty that could temper positive reactions. Analyzing previous predictions shows a general tendency towards a positive outlook as many believe improved relations may lessen regulatory risks. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration and the presence of other tech leaders. This has minimal direct impact on Apple. Previous predictions varied, some incorrectly focusing on Apple's CEO attending or interpreting general 'Big Tech' sentiment. Most correctly assessed a negligible influence on Apple. There's a general uncertainty, and any price movement is likely due to unrelated market factors. Taking all of these into account, the news is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price, thus suggesting balanced odds with a very small downward nudge.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration, which has virtually no direct bearing on Apple.  The news is primarily political and lacks specific information impacting Apple's financial performance or future prospects. While some previous predictions speculated on the broader implications of the relationship between Trump and Big Tech, the consensus is converging towards the news being largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Even the initial models that viewed the news as slightly positive for Apple based on the participation of Apple's CEO  in earlier rounds (which was later revealed to be mistaken and not actually present in this news) didn't assign high probabilities. The subsequent predictions show a trend toward a neutral outlook.  Therefore, any movement in Apple's stock price will most likely be due to broader market forces or other unrelated news, not this specific news item. I will assign probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting this conclusion.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Apple's CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. This event is primarily political and does not directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. While the presence of tech CEOs might signal a potential improvement in relations between Big Tech and the new administration, the immediate market reaction is likely to be neutral. Previous predictions from other models ranged from slightly positive to neutral, with no strong consensus on a significant impact. Given the lack of direct business implications and the mixed interpretations from other models, the stock price movement probabilities are balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes, including complacency, and mentions Apple Inc.

However, the author notes that despite this, the company's growth may slow due to market penetration and competition. The article does not provide any directly negative or positive information about Apple's future performance but rather serves as a reminder to investors to stay vigilant. Considering the neutral to slightly cautious tone regarding Apple and the lack of direct business implications, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. The previous predictions from other models also show a range of opinions, but most agree that the news has a negligible impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling to be close to equal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration.
