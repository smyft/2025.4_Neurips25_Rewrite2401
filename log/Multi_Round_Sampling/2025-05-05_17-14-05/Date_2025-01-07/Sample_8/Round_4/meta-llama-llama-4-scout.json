(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock often suggests a negative sentiment among analysts, particularly when coupled with a lukewarm reception concerning their AI initiatives. This indicates a lack of confidence in future growth drivers, which could lead to selling pressure. As a result, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article from Investing.com, sourced from UBS, presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While UBS doesn't recommend buying Apple, they also don't explicitly advise against owning it. The key concern is Apple's limited exposure to AI revenue in 2025 compared to companies heavily invested in AI. The article mentions that 'heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions', suggesting AI exposure is valued bythe market. It does also suggest that while AI names overall should perform well, as they see upside revisions in 2025, AAPL will not, due to 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025. The analysis does call this out as a weakness for AAPL when compared against other names, but does not suggest selling APPL stock. This suggests a limited upside revision to analysts estimates of AAPL which implies that there will not be a large positive impact on the stock price, but because the report isn't explicitly negative, I am rating that the stock is more likely to rise due to general market conditions than fall due to this news story. This is a neutral to slightly bearish take. , so I estimate a slightly higher chance of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline \"Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors\" is extremely vague.  Without specific details about the unfortunate news, it's impossible to make a reasonable prediction of stock price movement.  A lack of information implies equal probability of a rise or fall, or even no change. We assume the market already incorporates much of the available information into the stock price, therefore a vague headline that doesn't supply additional information would likely not cause a significant movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has received a downgrade from an analyst, citing a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives as a key reason. Analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment, leading to potential selling pressure. Given the lack of confidence highlighted in the news, it is more likely that the stock price will experience a short-term decline rather than a rise. However, the magnitude of the impact may depend on broader market conditions and other factors not mentioned in the headline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news discusses UBS's recommendations for 2025, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Notably, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth prospects from AI. However, the news does not directly provide a positive or negative outlook for Apple. Given that the news does not offer a specific recommendation for Apple and does not highlight any significant positive or negative factors directly affecting Apple, we should consider the overall neutral impact on Apple's stock price. However, the mention of limited AI exposure might slightly dampen enthusiasm, potentially leading to a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' is vague and does not provide specific details on what the unfortunate news might be. Without concrete information, it's challenging to predict how the market will react. However, generally speaking, unfortunate news tends to have a negative impact on investor sentiment, thereby increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock coupled with the lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives suggests a negative sentiment among analysts, which often leads to selling pressure. While some analyses indicate a mixed outlook, the overall theme leans towards a lack of confidence in Apple\u2019s future growth, particularly in relation to AI. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability that the stock price will fall as analysts' downgrades and negative sentiment typically precede declines in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article explicitly states that UBS believes Apple has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth prospects from AI compared to companies heavily focused on AI. While the article doesn't provide a direct \"buy\" or \"sell\" recommendation on Apple, the lack of AI exposure is presented in a negative light. This, in conjunction with other analyses in previous rounds where analysts express reservations about AI initiatives, I would expect a negative impact on investor sentiment. Considering the previous rounds also weighted on the negative sentiment more, I will lean negatively as well.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline is vague, offering no concrete information about the 'unfortunate news'.  However, the previous predictions provide valuable context.  The models diverge significantly, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.25 to 0.55 and probabilities of fall ranging from 0.45 to 0.75. The consensus leans slightly towards a fall, largely due to concerns about Apple's limited AI exposure compared to competitors.  While the lack of specifics makes a definitive prediction challenging, the uncertainty and slightly negative sentiment expressed in several previous predictions and the vague but negative headline suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  I am weighting the predictions of models that had relevant reasoning to arrive at this conclusion.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives, which generally suggests negative sentiment among analysts. Historical data and market behavior suggest that analyst downgrades often lead to short-term selling pressure, thereby increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. While some models provided neutral or slightly positive predictions, the majority leaned towards a negative impact, aligning with the typical market reaction to downgrades and lackluster reception of key initiatives like AI. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news discusses UBS's recommendations for 2025, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth prospects from AI. However, the news does not directly provide a positive or negative outlook for Apple. Given that the news does not offer a specific recommendation for Apple and does not highlight any significant positive or negative factors directly affecting Apple, we should consider the overall neutral impact on Apple's stock price. However, the mention of limited AI exposure might slightly dampen enthusiasm, potentially leading to a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' is vague and does not provide specific details on what the unfortunate news might be. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly higher probabilities of the stock price falling compared to rising. This suggests that the market may have already incorporated some negative information into the stock price. Given the lack of concrete information in the news headline and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' is vague and offers little context. Previous predictions have varied, with a general skew towards a slightly negative market response due to concerns around AI initiatives and exposure. Considering this context and historical analysis, my assessment leans towards a slightly higher probability of stock price falling due to the prevailing sentiment but remains cautious given the lack of specific information.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock combined with the lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives creates a generally negative sentiment among analysts. Multiple previous predictions highlight concerns regarding Apple's limited AI exposure relative to its competitors, which suggests a lack of growth prospects. While some models indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook, the majority express a strong lean towards a decline in stock prices due to the downgrade and negative sentiment. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report directly mentions Apple (AAPL) as having \"de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\" which they see as a negative compared to companies with heavier AI investment. While the report doesn't explicitly recommend selling AAPL, the implication is that its upside is limited compared to other tech stocks. Previous rounds of predictions have consistently leaned towards a negative impact on the stock price due to this perceived lack of AI exposure. Considering this consistent sentiment and the UBS report's direct commentary on Apple's AI prospects, I still believe a decrease in the stock price to be the more likely outcome.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline is vague, offering little concrete information. However, the repeated mention of Apple's limited AI revenue exposure in 2025 across multiple previous predictions creates a negative sentiment.  While some models initially suggested a more neutral outlook, the consensus across rounds leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The lack of specific details in the headline makes a strong prediction difficult, but the consistent negative undercurrent in previous analysis, coupled with the vague but negative headline, points towards a greater chance of the stock price declining. I am weighting the predictions of models from both rounds that had relevant and consistent reasoning. The overall trend strongly suggests that the market anticipates a negative impact due to concerns around AI, which outweighs any potential for a positive reaction based on this news alone. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a downgrade for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives, which typically signals negative sentiment among analysts. Analyst downgrades often lead to short-term selling pressure, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. While some models in previous rounds provided neutral or slightly positive predictions, the majority leaned towards a negative impact, aligning with the typical market reaction to downgrades and lackluster reception of key initiatives like AI. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news discusses UBS's recommendations for 2025, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth prospects from AI. While the news does not directly provide a positive or negative outlook for Apple, the mention of limited AI exposure might slightly dampen enthusiasm. Considering the trend of previous predictions, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising due to the prevailing sentiment that Apple's limited AI exposure could negatively impact its stock performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a general trend of negative sentiment towards Apple Inc.'s stock due to limited AI exposure and a lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives. While the news headline is vague, the previous predictions and reasoning provided by other models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising. Considering the lack of concrete information and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' is vague and offers little context. Previous predictions have varied, with a general skew towards a slightly negative market response due to concerns around AI initiatives and exposure. Most predictions point towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to the lack of confidence in future growth drivers, particularly in AI. Although there are some mixed views, the overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact on the stock price based on the provided information.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock, along with the negative assessment of its AI initiatives, creates clear headwinds for the company's stock price. Historical trends indicate that analyst downgrades often correlate with negative sentiment and selling pressure, suggesting that the current market reaction will likely be unfavorable. The consensus from previous predictions leans towards a higher likelihood of a stock price decline due to concerns about Apple's limited AI exposure compared to competitors and a lack of significant growth drivers. Therefore, I estimate a considerable probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The UBS report highlights AAPL's minimal AI exposure compared to peers, framing it as a limiting factor for upside in 2025. While not an explicit 'sell', the report favors other stocks (Dell, TD SYNNEX) and this implicitly creates negative pressure on Apple's stock. Prior rounds consistently leaned towards bearish sentiment due to AI concerns. Given the explicit mention of AAPL's AI shortcomings by UBS, and the reinforcing negative sentiment in prior predictions, the probability of a price fall is considered to be higher than the probability of a price rise with high confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline is vague, offering no specifics about the 'unfortunate news'. However, the consistent theme across multiple AI models and prediction rounds points towards a negative market sentiment.  This negativity stems primarily from concerns about Apple's limited AI revenue exposure compared to competitors.  While some models initially offered more neutral predictions, the consensus has steadily shifted towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The lack of concrete information in the headline reinforces the weight given to the consistent negative sentiment expressed throughout the previous rounds.  The trend clearly indicates that the market anticipates a negative impact due to concerns around AI, outweighing any potential for a positive reaction based on this vague news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates a downgrade for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives, which typically signals negative sentiment among analysts. Analyst downgrades often lead to short-term selling pressure, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. Previous predictions from multiple models have consistently leaned towards a negative impact, with probabilities of the stock price falling ranging from 0.65 to 0.75. The consensus highlights concerns about Apple's limited AI exposure relative to competitors, which suggests a lack of growth prospects. While some models provided neutral or slightly positive predictions, the majority express a strong lean towards a decline in stock prices due to the downgrade and negative sentiment. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses UBS's recommendations for 2025, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks while advising against IBM and Pure Storage.

Although the news headline is vague, the previous predictions and reasoning provided by other models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising. The consistent mention of Apple's limited AI revenue exposure in 2025 across multiple previous predictions creates a negative sentiment, and the lack of specific details in the headline makes a strong positive prediction difficult. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the overall sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' is coupled with multiple predictions from various models emphasizing concerns around Apple's limited AI exposure compared to its competitors. Most of these models indicate a trend of negative sentiment, citing downgrades, lukewarm reception of AI initiatives, and implications of limited growth prospects. The overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact on investor confidence, driving expectations of a downward stock price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
