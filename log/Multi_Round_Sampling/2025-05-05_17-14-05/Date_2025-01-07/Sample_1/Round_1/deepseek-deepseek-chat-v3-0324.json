(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that the stock price may experience downward pressure. The lack of specific details in the news content makes it difficult to quantify the impact precisely, but a probability of falling stock prices is likely higher than that of rising prices due to the negative connotation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment due to an analyst downgrade. The core reason cited is a 'lukewarm' reception of Apple's AI, which is a crucial growth area. Analyst downgrades often lead to investor concern and decreased trading volume due to lower confidence. There no supportive or counterbalancing positive news present in the provided snippet, increasing the likelihood of a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative analyst outlook on Apple stock, primarily due to a perceived lukewarm reception of Apple's AI initiatives.  Analyst downgrades often negatively impact stock price, leading to selling pressure. While the news is not overwhelmingly negative (it's only one analyst's opinion and doesn't include specific financial projections),  it suggests a decreased level of confidence in Apple's near-term prospects. This warrants a greater probability of a price fall than a price rise. However,  Apple is a large, established company, so the impact might be less significant than for a smaller company.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses UBS's outlook for the enterprise hardware and networking sector, highlighting Apple Inc. (AAPL) as having minimal exposure to AI revenue in 2025. UBS analysts expect limited upside revisions for AAPL due to its de minimis AI-related revenue, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple is a large-cap company with a diversified product line and strong brand loyalty, which may mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of a fall, but not significantly so due to Apple's overall market strength.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss UBS's recommendations for 2025, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Specifically, UBS mentions that Apple (AAPL) has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth prospects for the company in the near term. This could potentially lead to a negative perception of Apple's stock, increasing the likelihood of a stock price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article mentions that UBS advises against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025 due to limited upside, specifically stating that Apple has minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year. This lack of exposure to AI-driven growth, which is expected to be a significant factor in 2025, suggests that Apple's stock may not experience significant growth. However, the article does not directly predict a decline in Apple's stock price. Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it remaining stable or falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' is vague and does not provide specific details on what the unfortunate news might be. Without concrete information, it's challenging to predict how the market will react. However, generally speaking, unfortunate news tends to have a negative impact on investor sentiment, thereby increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
