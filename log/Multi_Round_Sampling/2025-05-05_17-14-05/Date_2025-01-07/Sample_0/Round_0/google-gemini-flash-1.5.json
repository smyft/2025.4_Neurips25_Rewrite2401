Analyst downgrades often negatively impact stock price, leading to selling pressure. While the news is not overwhelmingly negative, a lack of strong positive catalysts coupled with a negative assessment from an analyst suggests a higher probability that the stock price will fall in the short term.  However, Apple is a large, established company, and the market's reaction might be muted or short-lived.
