(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock often suggests a negative sentiment among analysts, particularly when citing concerns such as a lukewarm reception of their AI initiatives. Such downgrades can lead to reduced investor confidence and potentially trigger sell-offs. Therefore, the likelihood of a price decline is higher, while the chances of an uptick are reduced due to these negative indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment due to an analyst downgrade. The core reason cited is a 'lukewarm' reception of Apple's AI, which is a crucial growth area. Analyst downgrades often lead to investor concern and decreased trading volume due to lower confidence. There no supportive or counterbalancing positive news present in the provided snippet, increasing the likelihood of a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative analyst outlook on Apple stock, primarily due to a perceived lukewarm reception of Apple's AI initiatives.  Analyst downgrades often negatively impact stock price, leading to selling pressure. While the news is not overwhelmingly negative, a lack of strong positive catalysts coupled with a negative assessment from an analyst suggests a higher probability that the stock price will fall in the short term.  However, Apple is a large, established company, and the market's reaction might be muted or short-lived. The probability estimations reflect this balance of potential negative impact and Apple's overall market position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses UBS's outlook on Dell, TD SYNNEX, IBM, and Pure Storage, with limited direct mention of Apple (AAPL). However, it does note that Apple, along with IBM and Pure Storage, has minimal exposure to AI-related revenue in 2025, which UBS views as a limiting factor for upside revisions. Given that Apple is not a focal point of the report and the mention is neutral to slightly negative (due to lack of AI exposure), the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The broader market sentiment around AI-driven growth could indirectly affect Apple, but the direct implications from this news are limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests that the news content is likely to be negative for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Typically, such headlines imply potential challenges, downgrades, or unfavorable market developments specific to the company. Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the news could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, thereby increasing the likelihood of the stock price falling. The probability of the stock price rising under these circumstances seems low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses UBS's top picks for 2025, which include Dell and TD SYNNEX, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Although Apple is mentioned in the article, it is only noted that Apple, along with IBM and Pure Storage, has minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year and thus may not see significant upside revisions. However, there is no direct recommendation for or against Apple. Given this neutral to slightly negative mention, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the lack of positive catalysts mentioned in the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights UBS's recommendation for Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage for the year 2025. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of companies with limited AI-related revenue exposure, the focus is primarily on Dell and TD SYNNEX, suggesting a positive outlook for these companies. There is no specific positive or negative mention about Apple Inc., but the general sentiment could reflect broader market conditions, where Apple may be seen as having stable but less exciting prospects compared to Dell and TD SYNNEX.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This minimalistic mention of Apple along with the neutral-to-negative lean towards companies with higher AI exposure could slightly dampen investor sentiment for Apple.
