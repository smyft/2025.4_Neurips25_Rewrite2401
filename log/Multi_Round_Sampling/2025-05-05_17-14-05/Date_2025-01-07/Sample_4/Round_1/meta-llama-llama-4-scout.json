(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The headline and content indicate negative news for Apple stock investors, which typically suggests a bearish sentiment. Such news is likely to create a negative impact on investor confidence, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. Hence, the estimated probabilities reflect a strong likelihood of decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment due to an analyst downgrade. The core reason cited is a 'lukewarm' reception of Apple's AI, which is a crucial growth area. Analyst downgrades often lead to investor concern and decreased trading volume due to lower confidence. There no supportive or counterbalancing positive news present in the provided snippet, increasing the likelihood of a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline \"Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors\" is extremely vague.  Without specific details about the unfortunate news, it's impossible to make a reasonable prediction of stock price movement.  A lack of information implies equal probabilities of a price increase or decrease, although the market may already be pricing in some negative expectation given the ominous headline. Therefore I'm defaulting to a neutral position, slightly biasing towards a price decrease due to the negative sentiment of the headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a downgrade in Apple's stock due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI, which suggests a lack of confidence in the company's recent developments. Analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on stock prices as they influence investor sentiment. Given this information, it is more likely that the stock price will fall rather than rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news discusses UBS's recommendations for 2025, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Notably, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth prospects from AI. This neutral to negative commentary on Apple's AI exposure compared to other tech companies may lead to a relatively negative perception of Apple's stock. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate, given the company's diversified business and historical performance. The news does not provide directly positive or strongly negative catalysts specific to Apple, suggesting a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' has a strongly negative tone, suggesting that the news content contains information that is unfavorable to Apple stock investors. Although the news content itself is not provided, the headline alone implies a potential decline in investor confidence, which could lead to a decrease in the stock price. Therefore, based on the negative implication of the headline, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights positive prospects for Dell and TD SYNNEX while suggesting negative outlooks for IBM and Pure Storage for 2025. For Apple, since it is mentioned in a negative context regarding its limited AI-related revenue exposure, this could lead to cautious investor sentiment towards its stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
