(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The headline and content indicate negative news for Apple stock investors, which typically suggests a bearish sentiment. Such news is likely to create a negative impact on investor confidence, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. Without more specific details about the nature of the news, the probabilities lean towards a strong likelihood of decline in stock value.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights UBS's sector outlook, mentioning Apple in the context of limited AI revenue/exposure in 2025. UBS expects limited upside revisions for AAPL absent acquisitions, indicating a neutral to slightly negative sentiment. While not explicitly advising against Apple, the comparison to companies with minimal AI exposure suggests a potential underperformance relative to companies more involved in AI. There is no suggestion of any factors outside of UBS, which contributes to a higher degree of uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative analyst outlook on Apple due to lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives.  Analyst downgrades often negatively impact stock prices. While Apple is a large, established company, negative sentiment, especially regarding a key area of future growth like AI, can still cause short-term stock price declines. However, the impact might be limited due to the size and resilience of Apple.  The probability of a price fall is therefore weighted higher, but a significant drop is less likely than a moderate one.  A rise is still possible due to other market factors or a disconnect between analyst opinion and overall market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests negative sentiment or unfortunate events for Apple stock investors. Such headlines typically indicate potential challenges or risks that could negatively impact the company's stock price in the short term. Without specific details, the general tone of 'unfortunate news' leans towards a bearish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock has been downgraded by an analyst due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI. This negative sentiment from an analyst is likely to impact investor confidence negatively. Typically, downgrades and negative analyst comments lead to a decrease in stock price as they may signal underlying issues or reduced growth expectations. Therefore, based on this news, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple stock has received a downgrade due to a lukewarm reception of its AI, which suggests a negative sentiment towards the company's recent developments. This downgrade by an analyst implies a loss of confidence in the company's ability to inspire and innovate, potentially impacting investor trust and sentiment. As a result, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a downgrade for Apple Inc., citing a lack of confidence from an analyst, particularly due to the 'lukewarm' reception of their AI initiatives. This type of negative analyst commentary can often lead to short-term negative sentiment and stock price pressure. Given the weight of the news, investors might respond by selling off shares, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline and content indicate negative sentiment for Apple stock investors, suggesting potential challenges that could negatively impact the stock price. Multiple previous predictions reflect a consistent bearish outlook influenced by analysts' downgrades and lukewarm receptions regarding key innovations such as AI. This leads to a higher probability of price decline rather than an increase, aligning with the general trend seen in earlier predictions. Therefore, the assessment suggests a greater likelihood of stock price falling due to this unfortunate news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article directly mentions Apple (AAPL) and notes a UBS analyst highlighting \"limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025.\" This suggests a neutral to negative outlook for Apple, especially compared to companies expected to benefit more from the AI trend. The overall sentiment pushes towards a potential underperformance. Additionally, noting the trend from other models, there is a consistent push towards negative sentiment from this UBS analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative, focusing on an analyst's downgrade of Apple stock due to lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives.  While Apple is a large and generally resilient company, the negative sentiment, especially concerning a key growth area like AI, is likely to impact investor confidence.  This is reflected in the previous predictions, which consistently lean towards a higher probability of a price fall. The range of previous predictions (0.15-0.35 for rise, 0.65-0.85 for fall) suggests a consensus toward a negative impact, though the degree varies. Considering the lack of strong countervailing positive news and the weight of the negative sentiment in this particular news piece, I'm aligning my prediction with the majority view, slightly less pessimistic than the average, acknowledging Apple's inherent strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically mentioning a downgrade due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives. Analyst downgrades and negative sentiment, especially concerning key growth areas like AI, typically lead to short-term stock price declines. The consensus from previous predictions also leans heavily towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70-85% chance of a decline. While Apple's size and resilience might mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall sentiment and analyst downgrade suggest a bearish outlook in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative analyst outlook on Apple due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives. This type of negative sentiment from an analyst often leads to a decrease in investor confidence and can cause short-term stock price declines. While Apple is a large, established company with resilience, the immediate impact of a downgrade and negative comments on AI, a key area of future growth, is likely to be negative. The consensus from various predictions is that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. Considering the information and the trend of others' beliefs, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.25 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.75.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative analyst outlook on Apple due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives. This type of negative sentiment, especially from an analyst, can impact investor confidence and lead to a short-term decline in stock price. Considering the consistent predictions from other models, which also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, it's reasonable to conclude that the negative news will have a noticeable effect on the stock's performance. However, the company's size, resilience, and the general market conditions might mitigate the extent of the decline. Thus, a moderate decline seems more likely than a sharp drop, and the probabilities reflect this analysis.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a downgrade for Apple Inc., citing a lack of confidence from an analyst, particularly due to the 'lukewarm' reception of their AI initiatives. Multiple models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling, ranging from 0.7 to 0.85. These predictions highlight a consistent belief that the news negatively impacts investor confidence, and that analyst downgrades and perceived lack of innovation are likely to put downward pressure on the stock price. Despite this pessimism, there is still a small chance for positive market sentiment or other mitigating factors, which keeps the probability of rising stock price from being zero.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates negative sentiment for Apple stock investors, without providing specific details on the nature of the 'unfortunate news.' Previous predictions consistently indicate a bearish outlook due to analyst downgrades and concerns about insufficient growth in key areas like AI. The majority of predictions lean towards a high probability of a price decline (ranging from 0.65 to 0.85), reflecting a general consensus that negative sentiment among analysts is likely to impact investor confidence and lead to decreased stock prices in the short term. Given this context, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.23, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.77, Reasoning: The news highlights a UBS analyst report that mentions Apple's limited upside due to minimal AI-related revenue/exposure in 2025. This is considered a neutral to negative sentiment, and the previous predictions consistently lean towards a bearish outlook with falling stock prices. Considering the consensus of previous predictions and the analyst's negative outlook regarding Apple's AI initiatives, a fall in stock price is more likely. Though Apple is a large company, investor sentiment is crucial.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative, focusing on an analyst downgrade due to lukewarm reception of Apple's AI initiatives. This negative sentiment, particularly concerning a key growth area, is likely to impact investor confidence.  The consistent bearish predictions from multiple models across two rounds (ranging from 0.65 to 0.85 probability of falling) reinforce this negative outlook. While Apple's size and resilience could mitigate the impact, the immediate reaction is likely to be negative.  The consensus lean towards a price fall, albeit with some variation in the degree of the predicted fall. I'm therefore aligning with the majority view, acknowledging Apple's inherent strength but giving more weight to the negative news and consistent pessimistic predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically mentioning a downgrade due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives.

The consensus from previous predictions also leans heavily towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 70-85% chance of a decline. While Apple's size and resilience might mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall sentiment and analyst downgrade suggest a bearish outlook in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative analyst outlook on Apple Inc.

The consensus from various predictions is that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. Based on the analysis and trend of others' beliefs, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.25 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.75.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative analyst outlook on Apple due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives.

(AAPL) due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives. Consistent negative sentiments across multiple predictions from different models indicate a clear bearish outlook. There's a strong agreement among predictions that the negative news will lead to a decline in investor confidence, potentially causing a short-term stock price drop. Although Apple's resilience and size might mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall trend suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
