(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that the stock price may experience downward pressure. The lack of specific details in the news content makes it difficult to quantify the impact precisely, but the overall tone implies a higher probability of falling stock prices. Therefore, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Dell and TD SYNNEX, with negative sentiment towards IBM and Pure Storage. While Apple is mentioned in passing, the context is negative, stating 'limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025.' This suggests that UBS analysts aren't expecting positive revisions for Apple's stock price in 2025 due to limited AI exposure. This general comment without detailed analysis makes a substantial impact on estimated probabilities harder. The lack of specific targets or further explanation decreases the weighting of the claim to the overall probability calculation. Given that Apple is primarily driven by consumer electronics like iPhones, the immediate impact is low. However, if investors weigh this lack of AI upside as a significant downside, we may see some initial negative reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025 due to their expected growth in the AI server market and recovering PC market.  Conversely, the report advises against IBM and Pure Storage, citing limited AI exposure and other headwinds.  Apple is mentioned only in the context of having minimal AI-related revenue in 2025, placing it in the same category as IBM and Pure Storage.  This suggests that the news is mildly negative for Apple, as it implies a lack of significant growth drivers related to the AI boom that is expected to benefit other companies in the sector. The absence of positive news about Apple, coupled with the negativity surrounding similar companies, subtly suggests a higher probability of stagnation or slight decline rather than a significant price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights UBS's recommendations for 2025, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM, Pure Storage, and Apple (AAPL) due to limited AI revenue exposure. For Apple (AAPL), the article specifically mentions 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' which suggests a lack of near-term catalysts from AI-driven growth. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors, especially in a market where AI is a significant focus. However, Apple is a large, diversified company with strong brand loyalty and other revenue drivers, which may mitigate some downside risk. Given the mixed signals and Apple's overall market position, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise due to the negative sentiment from the UBS report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests that the news content is likely to be negative for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Typically, such headlines imply potential challenges, declines in performance, or other adverse developments. Given this, it is reasonable to infer that the stock price might react negatively. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple stock received a downgrade due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI, which suggests that the company's latest development has not met the analyst's expectations. This negative sentiment from an analyst can impact investor confidence and potentially lead to a decrease in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a downgrade for Apple Inc., citing a lack of confidence from an analyst, particularly due to the 'lukewarm' reception of their AI initiatives. This type of negative analyst commentary can often lead to short-term negative sentiment and stock price pressure. Given the weight of the news, investors might respond by selling off shares, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' clearly indicates negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. This aligns with previous predictions that suggest the stock is facing downward pressure due to concerns over AI revenue potential and general investor sentiment. Most models reflect a consensus that the news is unfavorable for the stock, estimating higher probabilities of a decline compared to an increase. Given the absence of any positive developments in the news and the prevailing negative outlook from multiple analysis rounds, it is reasonable to predict that the stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article explicitly states that UBS analysts believe Apple has \"de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\" which leads them to expect \"limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions).\" This is a negative assessment, particularly in the current market where AI is a key growth driver. While Apple is a large, established company, the lack of AI growth could make it less attractive to investors compared to companies like Dell, which UBS expects to benefit from AI server demand. The previous predictions consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting the negative sentiment stemming from the UBS report and the general market focus on AI. Considering the consensus from the previous rounds and the specific concerns raised by UBS, I maintain the expectation of a price decrease but slightly reduce the probability due to Apple's overall strength and brand recognition. A fall is still more probable than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector and doesn't offer a specific Apple stock price prediction.  While Apple is mentioned as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' this is framed negatively in the context of other companies with greater AI exposure.  This lack of significant AI growth driver, alongside negative assessments of similar companies (IBM and Pure Storage), contributes to a mildly negative outlook for Apple. However, it's crucial to note that the news is not intrinsically negative; it simply lacks positive catalysts in the AI sector.  Apple's overall financial health and diverse revenue streams are not addressed.  The previous predictions range widely (0.2-0.4 for rise, 0.6-0.8 for fall), indicating uncertainty. Considering the lack of direct negative news and Apple's established market position, a neutral stance with a slightly higher probability of no significant change is warranted, but still leaning toward a slight probability of decline reflecting the cautious market sentiment surrounding the company's limited AI engagement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025, while mentioning Apple (AAPL) in a negative light due to its minimal AI-related revenue/exposure in 2025. This suggests a lack of near-term catalysts for Apple's stock from the AI boom, which is currently a significant market focus. However, Apple is a large, diversified company with strong brand loyalty and other revenue drivers, which may mitigate some downside risk. Given the negative sentiment from the UBS report and the lack of positive news for Apple, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' and the subsequent analysis from various models suggest a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). The primary concern revolves around Apple's limited AI-related revenue exposure in 2025, which UBS analysts view as a downside. Multiple models indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this negative sentiment and the lack of immediate positive catalysts. However, some models also consider Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong brand loyalty, which may mitigate the downside risk. Weighing these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Stock Catches a Downgrade. Why This Analyst Isn\u2019t Impressed' and the content indicating a 'lukewarm' reception of Apple's AI initiatives suggest a negative sentiment towards the company. This, combined with the analyst's lack of confidence, can lead to a decrease in investor confidence and potentially a drop in the stock price. Considering the trend from previous predictions, which generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various reasons including limited AI exposure and negative analyst commentary, it's reasonable to infer that the current news will have a similar impact. Thus, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a lukewarm reception of Apple's AI initiatives, leading to a downgrade. Previous predictions have generally leaned towards a higher probability of stock price falling based on similar sentiments. Given the established pattern of negative reactions from both analysts and market dynamics, it's reasonable to maintain a pessimistic outlook on immediate price movements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' conveys a clearly negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. This aligns with the consensus from previous predictions that indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns over limited AI revenue exposure and the overall market focus on AI growth drivers. The repeated emphasis on negative analyst evaluations and the lack of positive news or developments for Apple further support the notion that the stock is likely to experience downward pressure. Based on this comprehensive analysis, I estimate a significant likelihood of a price decline compared to any potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on UBS's 2025 picks, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX due to AI server market growth and PC market recovery. Apple is negatively mentioned as having minimal AI revenue exposure in 2025, which analysts believe limits upside potential. Previous rounds consistently predict a higher probability of the stock price falling, driven by this lack of AI catalyst and general negative sentiment. Given the continuous negative news, most estimations are pessimistic. Taking all these factors into consideration, I will assign a reduced falling probability from the last rounds given the lack of change.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, giving a positive outlook for Dell and TD SYNNEX due to their AI exposure. Apple is mentioned only in passing and negatively \u2013  its minimal AI revenue exposure in 2025 is considered a limitation.  While this is not explicitly negative news for Apple (it doesn't announce a decline in sales or profits), the lack of significant positive projections for Apple contrasts sharply with the positive commentary about other companies in the report. This absence of positive news will likely weigh on investor sentiment.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise, reflecting this general negative sentiment and the lack of specific catalysts for price increase. Given Apple's size and diversified revenue streams, a significant drop is less likely than a slight dip or stagnation.  Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, but I\u2019m tempering the probability of a fall somewhat reflecting Apple's resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article from UBS provides a sector outlook favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX due to their expected growth in the AI server market and recovering PC market, while advising against IBM, Pure Storage, and Apple (AAPL) due to limited AI revenue exposure.
