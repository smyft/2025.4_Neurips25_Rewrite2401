(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, noting its strong customer base and increasing revenue from services. Furthermore, Buffett emphasizes a fundamental principle of investing in quality companies with sustained growth potential. Given Apple\u2019s success with its devices and services, as well as its ability to integrate AI into its offerings, this positive sentiment is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the mention of Apple's stock becoming 'expensive' suggests a possible cautious stance from some investors, which could temper stock price movements. Overall, the strong endorsement from Buffett should outweigh concerns about valuation, leading to higher probabilities for stock price appreciation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration across its product lines (iOS 18, iPhone 116), and significant investment in AI. These are strong indicators of future growth potential. However, the article also presents some cautionary notes from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding the broader AI market, highlighting potential overvaluation of certain tech stocks and a possible 'catch down' scenario if the broader corporate universe doesn't adopt AI technologies as quickly as anticipated. Furthermore, the article emphasizes that while Apple is a good investment, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, suggesting Apple's AI play might be more gradual and less explosive. A number of hedge fund holders is a slightly positive sentiment. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase due to the positive AI developments and strong financials, but the risk of a market correction and relative underperformance in the AI space is also significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would 'hold forever'.  While positive sentiment is implied by Buffett's long-term investment strategy (suggesting strong fundamentals and future growth potential), the news itself is not specific to Apple's recent performance or future prospects. It's a general statement about long-term holding, not a catalyst for immediate price movement.  Therefore, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal in the short-term. The probability of price movement is largely influenced by other market factors and company-specific news, not this general endorsement.  A slight increase in price might occur due to increased investor interest and confidence, but the effect is expected to be modest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is a personal reflection on the author's top five portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the lessons learned from each investment. The content is positive about Apple, highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market despite challenges. The author's long-term bullish stance and historical performance of Apple's stock suggest a favorable outlook. However, the article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so, as the news is more reflective than actionable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his top stock picks. AQR Capital Management, founded by Asness, holds a significant stake in Apple worth $1.87 billion as of Q3 2024. Additionally, Evercore ISI recently reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $94.9 billion, with product revenue up nearly 5% to $70 billion. These positive factors, combined with the overall bullish sentiment from a well-known investor and analyst, suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term investment approach and highlights Apple as one of the stocks to hold forever. The article mentions Apple's growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and high profit margins from its services business. It also notes that Apple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024, driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. Additionally, the article mentions that Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has held a large position in Apple since 2016 and still holds 300 million shares worth nearly $70 billion. Given this positive information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to increased investor confidence and potential long-term growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-known and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness views Apple as a potential buy despite his concerns about high CAPE ratios in the stock market. Additionally, recent sales trends show continued growth in the App Store, supporting the view that Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector. Although there is some caution due to volatility and underperformance of AI-related metrics, the overall signal is positive.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, showcasing its strong management, customer loyalty, and growth potential in services which have higher profit margins. Despite some caution around Apple's valuation, the overall sentiment remains positive due to its strong revenue growth, increasing active device base, and the potential for new AI-driven initiatives. The majority of predictions indicate a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation, especially given Buffett's endorsement and Apple's historical performance. Overall, the sentiment leans towards a higher probability of rising stock prices, supported by investor confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to its strong financials, AI integration, and innovative plans. BlackRock's commentary on AI and JPMorgan's analysis both suggest ongoing interest and investment in AI technologies, which is beneficial for Apple given its significant investments. However, the article also mentions potential overvaluation and the possibility of other AI stocks offering higher returns, alongside warnings about hardware revenue gaps potentially creating volatility in the AI value chain. This mix of positive and cautionary signals suggests a strong inclination for Apple stock to rise as other prior round predictions have stated, but it's also not without its risks. Considering previous predictions are all slightly bullish, and this is the latest update provided, I will nudge my prediction towards a rising, while keeping in mind the risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever', is positive for Apple but lacks specific details about Apple's current performance or future prospects.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted in the short-term. While Buffett's endorsement carries considerable weight and suggests strong underlying fundamentals, it's not a catalyst for immediate price action.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and diverse interpretations of the news.  The consensus leans slightly towards a price increase, but the relatively low variance suggests the news' impact is moderate.  Given the lack of specific new information, and the range of opinions from other models considering other information, a more conservative estimate is appropriate. I am adjusting the prediction to account for the overall consensus and the lack of specific news driving a strong prediction in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of the author's top portfolio holdings, highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The author's long-term bullish stance and historical performance of Apple's stock (4,120% growth since 2008) suggest a favorable outlook. However, the article is more reflective and does not provide new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with an average probability of around 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall. Given the overall positive sentiment but lack of immediate catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc.

These positive factors, combined with the overall bullish sentiment from a well-known investor and analyst, suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. However, the cautionary notes about high CAPE ratios and potential market volatility temper the outlook slightly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, noting its strong customer base, increasing revenue from services, and high profit margins. The endorsement from Buffett, combined with Apple's growing active installed base of devices and expanding services segment, suggests a positive outlook for the company. Although the article mentions that Apple's stock has become 'expensive', the overall sentiment is bullish, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher chance of the stock price increasing, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.7 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.3.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-established and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness views Apple as a potential buy despite his concerns about high CAPE ratios in the stock market. Additionally, recent sales trends show continued growth in the App Store, supporting the view that Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector. Although there is some caution due to volatility and underperformance of AI-related metrics, the overall signal is positive. The recent reaffirmation of an Outperform rating by Evercore ISI and Apple's consistent revenue growth further contribute to the positive outlook. Given the weight of this information, the probability of the stock price rising is considered relatively high.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, highlighting its strong customer base, growing services revenue, and positive outlook for future growth driven by AI integration. Despite mentions of overvaluation concerns, the overall sentiment from various analysts remains bullish, suggesting that Buffett's endorsement is likely to encourage investor confidence and support stock appreciation. The cumulative predictions from previous analysis rounds lean heavily towards a stock price increase, making a strong case for a higher probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial position, strategic integration of AI across its product lines, and significant investments in AI technology. The article mentions BlackRock's focus on AI infrastructure and JPMorgan's analysis of the AI value chain, suggesting continued investor interest in AI-driven companies. The launch of Apple Intelligence and the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT are also positive signals. While the article mentions some potential market risks and concerns about AI hardware revenue expectations, the overall sentiment is bullish on Apple's long-term prospects due to its AI advancements and solid financials. \n\nConsidering that previous predictions have generally leaned towards a positive stock movement, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.8 for a rise, and noting the trend of slight decreases in predicted rise probabilities in round 1, I will slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise compared to the average of the round 1 predictions while acknowledging the potential for volatility mentioned in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline, while positive, lacks specific details about Apple's performance or future prospects.  It's a general endorsement from Warren Buffett, suggesting strong long-term fundamentals. However, this is not a catalyst for immediate price movement.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price increase, mostly driven by additional information from other sources about Apple's financial performance and analyst ratings beyond this headline.  The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price increase, but after round 1, the range has narrowed and the certainty increased.  My analysis considers this consensus, the lack of specific news driving strong upward or downward movement in this specific headline, and overall market conditions.  Given the general positive sentiment influenced more by external factors than this headline, and the convergence of predictions, a slightly upward bias is warranted but not extremely high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc.

The endorsement from Buffett, combined with Apple's growing active installed base of devices and expanding services segment, suggests a positive outlook for the company. Although the article mentions that Apple's stock has become 'expensive', the overall sentiment is bullish, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.

Evercore ISI's reaffirmation of an Outperform rating with a price target of $250 and Apple's robust revenue growth also support a positive outlook. The overall trend from predictions in previous rounds also leans towards a higher probability of stock price appreciation.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term endorsement of Apple, indicating strong confidence in the company's fundamentals and growth potential. Apple is highlighted for its robust customer base, increasing services revenue, and successful integration of AI technologies, which suggests a positive trajectory for the company. Despite some caution regarding valuation, the overall sentiment in previous analyses leans towards an increase, bolstered by recent performances and investor optimism surrounding Apple's future prospects. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's strong financial performance, particularly its cash flow and shareholder returns. It also highlights Apple's integration of AI through 'Apple Intelligence' in its upcoming iOS, iPadOS, and macOS versions, along with its investment in AI and partnership with OpenAI for ChatGPT integration. These developments suggest potential for future growth and innovation, which are typically viewed positively by investors. However, the article also includes a caveat: that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering that previous predictions varied (from bullish to slightly neutral), and given the continued overall positive AI-related news and Apple's strong financial standing, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline itself is a relatively weak signal.  It mentions Apple as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would hold forever, which is positive but lacks specifics about current performance or future outlook.  The impact on the stock price is likely to be limited in the short term. However, the subsequent analysis rounds reveal that other information is influencing these predictions, suggesting that additional data about Apple's Q4 2024 earnings and separate analyst ratings contributed to the positive outlook.  The progression of probabilities shows a movement towards increased confidence in a stock price rise, with some variance depending on the models' interpretations of the context.  Considering the overall consensus among the various models and the fact the initial bullishness isn't solely attributed to this headline, I am giving more weight to this collective wisdom, thus predicting a higher probability of price increase while acknowledging the limitations of the headline's immediate influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive reflection on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the author's top portfolio holdings, emphasizing its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market.

However, the article is more reflective and does not provide new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with an average probability of around 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall.

Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, highlighting its strong customer base, increasing revenue from services, and high profit margins. The endorsement from Buffett, combined with Apple's growing active installed base of devices and expanding services segment, suggests a positive outlook for the company. Although the article mentions that Apple's stock has become 'expensive', the overall sentiment is bullish, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher chance of the stock price increasing, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.72 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.28.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in billionaire investor Cliff Asness's list of top stock recommendations. This endorsement adds credibility and may positively influence investor confidence. Recent financial performance shows Apple maintains strong revenue growth and service revenue gains. While concerns around valuation and potential market volatility exist, the overall sentiment from the article and several analyses leans positive. Previous prediction rounds demonstrate a growing consensus toward stock price appreciation, with many models predicting a rising probability between 0.7 to 0.75, while maintaining a cautious stance with a probability of 0.25 to 0.30 for a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
