(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, noting its strong customer base and increasing revenue from services. Furthermore, Buffett emphasizes a fundamental principle of investing in quality companies with sustained growth potential. Given Apple\u2019s success with its devices and services, as well as its ability to integrate AI into its offerings, this positive sentiment is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the mention of Apple's stock becoming 'expensive' suggests a possible cautious stance from some investors, which could temper stock price movements. Overall, the strong endorsement from Buffett should outweigh concerns about valuation, leading to higher probabilities for stock price appreciation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration across its product lines (iOS 18, iPhone 116), and significant investment in AI. These are strong indicators of future growth potential. However, the article also presents some cautionary notes from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding the broader AI market, highlighting potential overvaluation of certain tech stocks and a possible 'catch down' scenario if the broader corporate universe doesn't adopt AI technologies as quickly as anticipated. Furthermore, the article emphasizes that while Apple is a good investment, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, suggesting Apple's AI play might be more gradual and less explosive. A number of hedge fund holders is a slightly positive sentiment. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase due to the positive AI developments and strong financials, but the risk of a market correction and relative underperformance in the AI space is also significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would 'hold forever'.  While positive sentiment is implied by Buffett's long-term investment strategy (suggesting strong fundamentals and future growth potential), the news itself is not specific to Apple's recent performance or future prospects. It's a general statement about long-term holding, not a catalyst for immediate price movement.  Therefore, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal in the short-term. The probability of price movement is largely influenced by other market factors and company-specific news, not this general endorsement.  A slight increase in price might occur due to increased investor interest and confidence, but the effect is expected to be modest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is a personal reflection on the author's top five portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the lessons learned from each investment. The content is positive about Apple, highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market despite challenges. The author's long-term bullish stance and historical performance of Apple's stock suggest a favorable outlook. However, the article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so, as the news is more reflective than actionable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his top stock picks. AQR Capital Management, founded by Asness, holds a significant stake in Apple worth $1.87 billion as of Q3 2024. Additionally, Evercore ISI recently reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $94.9 billion, with product revenue up nearly 5% to $70 billion. These positive factors, combined with the overall bullish sentiment from a well-known investor and analyst, suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term investment approach and highlights Apple as one of the stocks to hold forever. The article mentions Apple's growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and high profit margins from its services business. It also notes that Apple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024, driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. Additionally, the article mentions that Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has held a large position in Apple since 2016 and still holds 300 million shares worth nearly $70 billion. Given this positive information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to increased investor confidence and potential long-term growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-known and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness views Apple as a potential buy despite his concerns about high CAPE ratios in the stock market. Additionally, recent sales trends show continued growth in the App Store, supporting the view that Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector. Although there is some caution due to volatility and underperformance of AI-related metrics, the overall signal is positive.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, showcasing its strong management, customer loyalty, and growth potential in services which have higher profit margins. Despite some caution around Apple's valuation, the overall sentiment remains positive due to its strong revenue growth, increasing active device base, and the potential for new AI-driven initiatives. The majority of predictions indicate a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation, especially given Buffett's endorsement and Apple's historical performance. Overall, the sentiment leans towards a higher probability of rising stock prices, supported by investor confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to its strong financials, AI integration, and innovative plans. BlackRock's commentary on AI and JPMorgan's analysis both suggest ongoing interest and investment in AI technologies, which is beneficial for Apple given its significant investments. However, the article also mentions potential overvaluation and the possibility of other AI stocks offering higher returns, alongside warnings about hardware revenue gaps potentially creating volatility in the AI value chain. This mix of positive and cautionary signals suggests a strong inclination for Apple stock to rise as other prior round predictions have stated, but it's also not without its risks. Considering previous predictions are all slightly bullish, and this is the latest update provided, I will nudge my prediction towards a rising, while keeping in mind the risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever', is positive for Apple but lacks specific details about Apple's current performance or future prospects.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted in the short-term. While Buffett's endorsement carries considerable weight and suggests strong underlying fundamentals, it's not a catalyst for immediate price action.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and diverse interpretations of the news.  The consensus leans slightly towards a price increase, but the relatively low variance suggests the news' impact is moderate.  Given the lack of specific new information, and the range of opinions from other models considering other information, a more conservative estimate is appropriate. I am adjusting the prediction to account for the overall consensus and the lack of specific news driving a strong prediction in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of the author's top portfolio holdings, highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The author's long-term bullish stance and historical performance of Apple's stock (4,120% growth since 2008) suggest a favorable outlook. However, the article is more reflective and does not provide new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with an average probability of around 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall. Given the overall positive sentiment but lack of immediate catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his top stock picks. AQR Capital Management, founded by Asness, holds a significant stake in Apple worth $1.87 billion as of Q3 2024.

These positive factors, combined with the overall bullish sentiment from a well-known investor and analyst, suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. However, the cautionary notes about high CAPE ratios and potential market volatility temper the outlook slightly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, noting its strong customer base, increasing revenue from services, and high profit margins. The endorsement from Buffett, combined with Apple's growing active installed base of devices and expanding services segment, suggests a positive outlook for the company. Although the article mentions that Apple's stock has become 'expensive', the overall sentiment is bullish, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher chance of the stock price increasing, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.7 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.3.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-established and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness views Apple as a potential buy despite his concerns about high CAPE ratios in the stock market. Additionally, recent sales trends show continued growth in the App Store, supporting the view that Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector. Although there is some caution due to volatility and underperformance of AI-related metrics, the overall signal is positive. The recent reaffirmation of an Outperform rating by Evercore ISI and Apple's consistent revenue growth further contribute to the positive outlook. Given the weight of this information, the probability of the stock price rising is considered relatively high.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, highlighting its strong customer base, growing services revenue, and positive outlook for future growth driven by AI integration. Despite mentions of overvaluation concerns, the overall sentiment from various analysts remains bullish, suggesting that Buffett's endorsement is likely to encourage investor confidence and support stock appreciation. The cumulative predictions from previous analysis rounds lean heavily towards a stock price increase, making a strong case for a higher probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial position, strategic integration of AI across its product lines, and significant investments in AI technology. The article mentions BlackRock's focus on AI infrastructure and JPMorgan's analysis of the AI value chain, suggesting continued investor interest in AI-driven companies. The launch of Apple Intelligence and the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT are also positive signals. While the article mentions some potential market risks and concerns about AI hardware revenue expectations, the overall sentiment is bullish on Apple's long-term prospects due to its AI advancements and solid financials. \n\nConsidering that previous predictions have generally leaned towards a positive stock movement, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.8 for a rise, and noting the trend of slight decreases in predicted rise probabilities in round 1, I will slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise compared to the average of the round 1 predictions while acknowledging the potential for volatility mentioned in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline, while positive, lacks specific details about Apple's performance or future prospects.  It's a general endorsement from Warren Buffett, suggesting strong long-term fundamentals. However, this is not a catalyst for immediate price movement.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price increase, mostly driven by additional information from other sources about Apple's financial performance and analyst ratings beyond this headline.  The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price increase, but after round 1, the range has narrowed and the certainty increased.  My analysis considers this consensus, the lack of specific news driving strong upward or downward movement in this specific headline, and overall market conditions.  Given the general positive sentiment influenced more by external factors than this headline, and the convergence of predictions, a slightly upward bias is warranted but not extremely high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of the author's top portfolio holdings, emphasizing its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The author's long-term bullish stance and historical performance of Apple's stock (4,120% growth since 2008) suggest a favorable outlook. However, the article is more reflective and does not provide new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with an average probability of around 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall. Given the overall positive sentiment but lack of immediate catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, noting its strong customer base, increasing revenue from services, and high profit margins. The endorsement from Buffett, combined with Apple's growing active installed base of devices and expanding services segment, suggests a positive outlook for the company. Although the article mentions that Apple's stock has become 'expensive', the overall sentiment is bullish, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher chance of the stock price increasing, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.72 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.28.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-established and successful investor, holds Apple Inc.

Additionally, recent sales trends show continued growth in the App Store, supporting the view that Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector. Although there is some caution due to volatility and underperformance of AI-related metrics, the overall signal is positive. Evercore ISI's reaffirmation of an Outperform rating with a price target of $250 and Apple's robust revenue growth also support a positive outlook. The overall trend from predictions in previous rounds also leans towards a higher probability of stock price appreciation.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term endorsement of Apple, indicating strong confidence in the company's fundamentals and growth potential. Apple is highlighted for its robust customer base, increasing services revenue, and successful integration of AI technologies, which suggests a positive trajectory for the company. Despite some caution regarding valuation, the overall sentiment in previous analyses leans towards an increase, bolstered by recent performances and investor optimism surrounding Apple's future prospects. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's strong financial performance, particularly its cash flow and shareholder returns. It also highlights Apple's integration of AI through 'Apple Intelligence' in its upcoming iOS, iPadOS, and macOS versions, along with its investment in AI and partnership with OpenAI for ChatGPT integration. These developments suggest potential for future growth and innovation, which are typically viewed positively by investors. However, the article also includes a caveat: that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering that previous predictions varied (from bullish to slightly neutral), and given the continued overall positive AI-related news and Apple's strong financial standing, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline itself is a relatively weak signal.  It mentions Apple as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would hold forever, which is positive but lacks specifics about current performance or future outlook.  The impact on the stock price is likely to be limited in the short term. However, the subsequent analysis rounds reveal that other information is influencing these predictions, suggesting that additional data about Apple's Q4 2024 earnings and separate analyst ratings contributed to the positive outlook.  The progression of probabilities shows a movement towards increased confidence in a stock price rise, with some variance depending on the models' interpretations of the context.  Considering the overall consensus among the various models and the fact the initial bullishness isn't solely attributed to this headline, I am giving more weight to this collective wisdom, thus predicting a higher probability of price increase while acknowledging the limitations of the headline's immediate influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive reflection on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the author's top portfolio holdings, emphasizing its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The author's long-term bullish stance and historical performance of Apple's stock (4,120% growth since 2008) suggest a favorable outlook. However, the article is more reflective and does not provide new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with an average probability of around 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall.

This endorsement adds credibility and may positively influence investor confidence. Recent financial performance shows Apple maintains strong revenue growth and service revenue gains. While concerns around valuation and potential market volatility exist, the overall sentiment from the article and several analyses leans positive. Previous prediction rounds demonstrate a growing consensus toward stock price appreciation, with many models predicting a rising probability between 0.7 to 0.75, while maintaining a cautious stance with a probability of 0.25 to 0.30 for a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
