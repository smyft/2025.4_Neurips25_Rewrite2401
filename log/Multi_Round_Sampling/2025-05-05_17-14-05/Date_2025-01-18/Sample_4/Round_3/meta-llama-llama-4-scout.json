(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, noting its strong customer base and increasing revenue from services. Furthermore, Buffett emphasizes a fundamental principle of investing in quality companies with sustained growth potential. Given Apple\u2019s success with its devices and services, as well as its ability to integrate AI into its offerings, this positive sentiment is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the mention of Apple's stock becoming 'expensive' suggests a possible cautious stance from some investors, which could temper stock price movements. Overall, the strong endorsement from Buffett should outweigh concerns about valuation, leading to higher probabilities for stock price appreciation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration across its product lines (iOS 18, iPhone 116), and significant investment in AI. These are strong indicators of future growth potential. However, the article also presents some cautionary notes from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding the broader AI market, highlighting potential overvaluation of certain tech stocks and a possible 'catch down' scenario if the broader corporate universe doesn't adopt AI technologies as quickly as anticipated. Furthermore, the article emphasizes that while Apple is a good investment, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, suggesting Apple's AI play might be more gradual and less explosive. A number of hedge fund holders is a slightly positive sentiment. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase due to the positive AI developments and strong financials, but the risk of a market correction and relative underperformance in the AI space is also significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would 'hold forever'.  While positive sentiment is implied by Buffett's long-term investment strategy (suggesting strong fundamentals and future growth potential), the news itself is not specific to Apple's recent performance or future prospects. It's a general statement about long-term holding, not a catalyst for immediate price movement.  Therefore, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal in the short-term. The probability of price movement is largely influenced by other market factors and company-specific news, not this general endorsement.  A slight increase in price might occur due to increased investor interest and confidence, but the effect is expected to be modest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is a personal reflection on the author's top five portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the lessons learned from each investment. The content is positive about Apple, highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market despite challenges. The author's long-term bullish stance and historical performance of Apple's stock suggest a favorable outlook. However, the article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so, as the news is more reflective than actionable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his top stock picks. AQR Capital Management, founded by Asness, holds a significant stake in Apple worth $1.87 billion as of Q3 2024. Additionally, Evercore ISI recently reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $94.9 billion, with product revenue up nearly 5% to $70 billion. These positive factors, combined with the overall bullish sentiment from a well-known investor and analyst, suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term investment approach and highlights Apple as one of the stocks to hold forever. The article mentions Apple's growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and high profit margins from its services business. It also notes that Apple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024, driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. Additionally, the article mentions that Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has held a large position in Apple since 2016 and still holds 300 million shares worth nearly $70 billion. Given this positive information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to increased investor confidence and potential long-term growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-known and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness views Apple as a potential buy despite his concerns about high CAPE ratios in the stock market. Additionally, recent sales trends show continued growth in the App Store, supporting the view that Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector. Although there is some caution due to volatility and underperformance of AI-related metrics, the overall signal is positive.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, showcasing its strong management, customer loyalty, and growth potential in services which have higher profit margins. Despite some caution around Apple's valuation, the overall sentiment remains positive due to its strong revenue growth, increasing active device base, and the potential for new AI-driven initiatives. The majority of predictions indicate a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation, especially given Buffett's endorsement and Apple's historical performance. Overall, the sentiment leans towards a higher probability of rising stock prices, supported by investor confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to its strong financials, AI integration, and innovative plans. BlackRock's commentary on AI and JPMorgan's analysis both suggest ongoing interest and investment in AI technologies, which is beneficial for Apple given its significant investments. However, the article also mentions potential overvaluation and the possibility of other AI stocks offering higher returns, alongside warnings about hardware revenue gaps potentially creating volatility in the AI value chain. This mix of positive and cautionary signals suggests a strong inclination for Apple stock to rise as other prior round predictions have stated, but it's also not without its risks. Considering previous predictions are all slightly bullish, and this is the latest update provided, I will nudge my prediction towards a rising, while keeping in mind the risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever', is positive for Apple but lacks specific details about Apple's current performance or future prospects.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted in the short-term. While Buffett's endorsement carries considerable weight and suggests strong underlying fundamentals, it's not a catalyst for immediate price action.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and diverse interpretations of the news.  The consensus leans slightly towards a price increase, but the relatively low variance suggests the news' impact is moderate.  Given the lack of specific new information, and the range of opinions from other models considering other information, a more conservative estimate is appropriate. I am adjusting the prediction to account for the overall consensus and the lack of specific news driving a strong prediction in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of the author's top portfolio holdings, highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The author's long-term bullish stance and historical performance of Apple's stock (4,120% growth since 2008) suggest a favorable outlook. However, the article is more reflective and does not provide new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with an average probability of around 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall. Given the overall positive sentiment but lack of immediate catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his top stock picks. AQR Capital Management, founded by Asness, holds a significant stake in Apple worth $1.87 billion as of Q3 2024.

Apple's Q4 2024 revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $94.9 billion, with product revenue up nearly 5% to $70 billion. These positive factors, combined with the overall bullish sentiment from a well-known investor and analyst, suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. However, the cautionary notes about high CAPE ratios and potential market volatility temper the outlook slightly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, noting its strong customer base, increasing revenue from services, and high profit margins. The endorsement from Buffett, combined with Apple's growing active installed base of devices and expanding services segment, suggests a positive outlook for the company. Although the article mentions that Apple's stock has become 'expensive', the overall sentiment is bullish, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher chance of the stock price increasing, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.7 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.3.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-established and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness views Apple as a potential buy despite his concerns about high CAPE ratios in the stock market. Additionally, recent sales trends show continued growth in the App Store, supporting the view that Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector. Although there is some caution due to volatility and underperformance of AI-related metrics, the overall signal is positive. The recent reaffirmation of an Outperform rating by Evercore ISI and Apple's consistent revenue growth further contribute to the positive outlook. Given the weight of this information, the probability of the stock price rising is considered relatively high.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, highlighting its strong customer base, growing services revenue, and positive outlook for future growth driven by AI integration. Despite mentions of overvaluation concerns, the overall sentiment from various analysts remains bullish, suggesting that Buffett's endorsement is likely to encourage investor confidence and support stock appreciation. The cumulative predictions from previous analysis rounds lean heavily towards a stock price increase, making a strong case for a higher probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial position, strategic integration of AI across its product lines, and significant investments in AI technology. The article mentions BlackRock's focus on AI infrastructure and JPMorgan's analysis of the AI value chain, suggesting continued investor interest in AI-driven companies. The launch of Apple Intelligence and the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT are also positive signals. While the article mentions some potential market risks and concerns about AI hardware revenue expectations, the overall sentiment is bullish on Apple's long-term prospects due to its AI advancements and solid financials. \n\nConsidering that previous predictions have generally leaned towards a positive stock movement, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.8 for a rise, and noting the trend of slight decreases in predicted rise probabilities in round 1, I will slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise compared to the average of the round 1 predictions while acknowledging the potential for volatility mentioned in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline, while positive, lacks specific details about Apple's performance or future prospects.  It's a general endorsement from Warren Buffett, suggesting strong long-term fundamentals. However, this is not a catalyst for immediate price movement.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price increase, mostly driven by additional information from other sources about Apple's financial performance and analyst ratings beyond this headline.  The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price increase, but after round 1, the range has narrowed and the certainty increased.  My analysis considers this consensus, the lack of specific news driving strong upward or downward movement in this specific headline, and overall market conditions.  Given the general positive sentiment influenced more by external factors than this headline, and the convergence of predictions, a slightly upward bias is warranted but not extremely high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of the author's top portfolio holdings, emphasizing its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market.

Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with an average probability of around 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall.
