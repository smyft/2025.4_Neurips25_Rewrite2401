(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on investing in consumer durables stocks, which may generally have a positive connotation for companies in that sector, including Apple Inc. However, the lack of specific positive or negative news directly related to Apple reduces the likelihood of a significant stock movement. Considering Apple is a major player in consumer electronics, which can be categorized under consumer durables, there is a moderate chance that interest in the sector could benefit its stock price. However, without specific news affecting Apple or external market factors, the estimated probabilities remain cautious.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's largest portfolio holdings, which includes Apple (AAPL). The article indirectly gives a bullish outlook on Apple by highlighting the resilience of its services segment, its strong position in the smartphone market, and the historical returns of the stock. The mention of steady high returns increases confidence. The article is published by The Motley Fool. While this isn't direct company news, it's an analyst's positive view expressed on a public platform, which could generate positive sentiment although the main theme of such portfolio review doesn't immediately dictate positive or negative outlook towards the stock. Therefore, a slight positive influence is expected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Cliff Asness, a prominent billionaire investor, holds a significant stake in Apple (AAPL) through his firm AQR Capital Management.  While Asness's overall outlook on the broader market is cautious, his substantial investment in AAPL suggests a positive view on the company's prospects.  The article further mentions strong Q4 2024 results for Apple, including revenue growth and robust cash flow.  However, the article also notes that Madison Investments is underweight on AAPL, indicating some degree of market uncertainty.  The App Store's performance is cited as positive, but the overall sentiment is balanced, with a focus on other companies deemed more promising in the AI sector. Therefore, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but the impact of this news alone is not overly significant to strongly suggest a major price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is very generic and does not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Without concrete details such as financial performance, product launches, or market trends related to Apple, it is challenging to make a precise prediction. Consumer durables stocks can be influenced by broader economic factors, but the lack of specific information about Apple limits the ability to assess its stock price movement accurately. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the neutral and non-specific nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's past performance, its current business model transition towards services, and the potential for future growth. While Apple's services segment is growing rapidly and has a high gross margin, the company's valuation has become richer with a P/E ratio of 38.4, up from 25 five years ago. The article concludes that unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years. Based on this analysis, it seems that the stock price might not rise significantly, and there is a possibility of it falling if the market corrects its valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett, a highly respected and successful investor, recommending two stocks to hold forever, with Apple Inc. being one of them. This endorsement can be seen as a positive sentiment towards the company, potentially increasing investor confidence and driving up the stock price. However, the news does not provide any new or groundbreaking information about Apple's current performance or future prospects, which might limit the impact on the stock price. Considering the positive sentiment and the lack of negative information, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is too general and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. The headline does not contain any new information, guidance, or updates directly related to Apple Inc.'s performance or future projections. Without specific details on how the news impacts Apple directly, it is challenging to draw conclusions about its effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses investing in consumer durables stocks broadly, which could have a positive impact on companies like Apple Inc. that operate within this sector. However, the lack of specific information regarding Apple's own performance or any recent developments means that predictions must be cautious. Past predictions from other analysts show a spectrum of sentiment, with some leaning towards slight positivity based on investment highlights while others indicate neutral or negative sentiment due to valuation concerns. Overall, the general bullish trend towards consumer durables and Apple's established position in that market leads to a moderate probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's top portfolio holdings, which include Apple. The investor notes that Apple has been very successful, and while some believed it had reached its peak valuation in 2018, it has continued to produce significant returns for investors. The article highlights the resilience of the Apple services segment. The investor also notes how costly selling Apple stock too soon can be. This indicates a generally bullish, though tempered, outlook. The previous round of predictions had varied estimates. Considering the positive context, and somewhat increased positive language relative to the previous predictions, I predict a slightly more positive movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece is mixed. While Cliff Asness's large position in AAPL is bullish, his overall market outlook is cautious.  Positive factors include Asness's strong performance, Apple's Q4 revenue growth, and Evercore ISI's positive rating.  However, counterbalancing this is Madison Investment's underweight position in AAPL and the article's suggestion that other AI stocks might offer better returns. The previous predictions are quite varied, highlighting the uncertainty.  Considering the overall mixed signals and the absence of overwhelmingly positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, a relatively neutral probability distribution is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to Asness's significant holding and Apple's recent positive financial performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is generic and lacks specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and historical performance, while others remain neutral or slightly negative due to valuation concerns and lack of specific news. Considering the lack of direct impact from the news and the balanced sentiment from previous predictions, the probabilities are assigned cautiously.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's past performance, its current business model transition towards services, and the potential for future growth. However, it also mentions that the valuation has become richer with a P/E ratio of 38.4, up from 25 five years ago, and that unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years. The article concludes that Apple has a powerful brand and the ability to produce free cash flow, but it also notes that the stock price has jumped nearly 200% in the past five years, supported by significantly higher earnings per share. Considering these factors, there seems to be a balanced view but with a slightly negative tilt due to the rich valuation and the potential for a market correction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc., as Warren Buffett is a highly respected and successful investor. Although the news does not provide any new or groundbreaking information about Apple's current performance or future prospects, the endorsement from Buffett can increase investor confidence and potentially drive up the stock price. Considering the positive sentiment and the lack of negative information, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. Additionally, analyzing the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly positive to neutral sentiments, which also supports the estimation of a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline about investing in consumer durables stocks generally carries a positive connotation, particularly for a major player like Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the lack of specific information regarding Apple's performance, recent developments, or market conditions contributes to a cautious outlook. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment overall, with some leaning slightly positive due to strong performance and investor confidence, while others highlight valuation concerns. Given this context, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, while also accounting for the cautious sentiment reflected in other analyses.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's largest holdings, including Apple. The investor's detailed and overwhelmingly positive experiences and insights into Apple's resilience, growth in its services sector, strong market position, and historical returns, all serve to positively reinforce its investment appeal. Also, although the news doesn't directly highlight Apple's future plans or financials, it emphasizes the enduring value of holding AAPL long-term, citing significant gains since 2008. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, but I am opting for slightly higher probability of rise this time. The mention of not selling too early and buy and hold principle add to the bullish sentiment. Thus, I predict the stock is more likely to increase slightly than decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook on Apple.  A significant positive is the large investment in AAPL by Cliff Asness, a well-respected value and momentum investor.  Asness's firm, AQR Capital Management, holds a substantial $1.87 billion stake.  This suggests confidence in Apple's future.  Furthermore, Apple's Q4 2024 results showed revenue growth and strong operating cash flow. Evercore ISI's positive rating and the strong performance of the App Store also contribute to a positive sentiment. However, counterbalancing these positives is Madison Investments' underweight position in AAPL and the article's suggestion that other AI-focused stocks may offer potentially higher returns.  The overall market sentiment expressed by Asness is also cautious. The previous predictions show a range of opinions but mostly leaned slightly positive, before the last round showing more neutral to negative outlook.  Considering the mixed signals and the absence of overwhelmingly positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, a relatively neutral probability distribution is appropriate, with a slight leaning towards a price rise due to Asness's significant investment and Apple's recent positive performance, but tempered by the less enthusiastic opinions of other analysts and the overall market uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is generic and lacks specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and historical performance, while others remain neutral or slightly negative due to valuation concerns and lack of specific news. Considering the lack of direct impact from the news and the balanced sentiment from previous predictions, the probabilities are assigned cautiously. The general bullish trend towards consumer durables and Apple's established position in that market leads to a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but the lack of specific positive catalysts keeps the prediction conservative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Apple's past performance, its transition towards services, and future growth potential. While Apple's services segment is growing rapidly with a high gross margin, the company's valuation has become richer with a P/E ratio of 38.4, up from 25 five years ago. The article concludes that unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years. Considering the mixed sentiment from previous predictions and the rich valuation, there seems to be a balanced view but with a slightly negative tilt.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc., as Warren Buffett is a highly respected and successful investor. This endorsement can increase investor confidence and potentially drive up the stock price. Analyzing the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly positive to neutral sentiments, which also supports the estimation of a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the lack of specific new information about Apple's current performance or future prospects tempers this optimism. Given the balance of positive sentiment from the Buffett endorsement and the mixed but generally cautious predictions from other models, a moderate estimation of probabilities is warranted.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is broad and offers no specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments based on varying factors including market conditions, Apple's services segment resilience, market experts' views, and concerns about the stock's valuation. Considering the current mix of bullish and bearish indications and the neutral nature of the news provided, the overall sentiment remains somewhat cautious.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
