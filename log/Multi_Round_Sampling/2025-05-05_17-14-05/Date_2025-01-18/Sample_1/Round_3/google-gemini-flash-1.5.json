(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on investing in consumer durables stocks, which may generally have a positive connotation for companies in that sector, including Apple Inc. However, the lack of specific positive or negative news directly related to Apple reduces the likelihood of a significant stock movement. Considering Apple is a major player in consumer electronics, which can be categorized under consumer durables, there is a moderate chance that interest in the sector could benefit its stock price. However, without specific news affecting Apple or external market factors, the estimated probabilities remain cautious.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's largest portfolio holdings, which includes Apple (AAPL). The article indirectly gives a bullish outlook on Apple by highlighting the resilience of its services segment, its strong position in the smartphone market, and the historical returns of the stock. The mention of steady high returns increases confidence. The article is published by The Motley Fool. While this isn't direct company news, it's an analyst's positive view expressed on a public platform, which could generate positive sentiment although the main theme of such portfolio review doesn't immediately dictate positive or negative outlook towards the stock. Therefore, a slight positive influence is expected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Cliff Asness, a prominent billionaire investor, holds a significant stake in Apple (AAPL) through his firm AQR Capital Management.  While Asness's overall outlook on the broader market is cautious, his substantial investment in AAPL suggests a positive view on the company's prospects.  The article further mentions strong Q4 2024 results for Apple, including revenue growth and robust cash flow.  However, the article also notes that Madison Investments is underweight on AAPL, indicating some degree of market uncertainty.  The App Store's performance is cited as positive, but the overall sentiment is balanced, with a focus on other companies deemed more promising in the AI sector. Therefore, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but the impact of this news alone is not overly significant to strongly suggest a major price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is very generic and does not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Without concrete details such as financial performance, product launches, or market trends related to Apple, it is challenging to make a precise prediction. Consumer durables stocks can be influenced by broader economic factors, but the lack of specific information about Apple limits the ability to assess its stock price movement accurately. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the neutral and non-specific nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's past performance, its current business model transition towards services, and the potential for future growth. While Apple's services segment is growing rapidly and has a high gross margin, the company's valuation has become richer with a P/E ratio of 38.4, up from 25 five years ago. The article concludes that unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years. Based on this analysis, it seems that the stock price might not rise significantly, and there is a possibility of it falling if the market corrects its valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett, a highly respected and successful investor, recommending two stocks to hold forever, with Apple Inc. being one of them. This endorsement can be seen as a positive sentiment towards the company, potentially increasing investor confidence and driving up the stock price. However, the news does not provide any new or groundbreaking information about Apple's current performance or future prospects, which might limit the impact on the stock price. Considering the positive sentiment and the lack of negative information, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is too general and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. The headline does not contain any new information, guidance, or updates directly related to Apple Inc.'s performance or future projections. Without specific details on how the news impacts Apple directly, it is challenging to draw conclusions about its effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses investing in consumer durables stocks broadly, which could have a positive impact on companies like Apple Inc. that operate within this sector. However, the lack of specific information regarding Apple's own performance or any recent developments means that predictions must be cautious. Past predictions from other analysts show a spectrum of sentiment, with some leaning towards slight positivity based on investment highlights while others indicate neutral or negative sentiment due to valuation concerns. Overall, the general bullish trend towards consumer durables and Apple's established position in that market leads to a moderate probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's top portfolio holdings, which include Apple. The investor notes that Apple has been very successful, and while some believed it had reached its peak valuation in 2018, it has continued to produce significant returns for investors. The article highlights the resilience of the Apple services segment. The investor also notes how costly selling Apple stock too soon can be. This indicates a generally bullish, though tempered, outlook. The previous round of predictions had varied estimates. Considering the positive context, and somewhat increased positive language relative to the previous predictions, I predict a slightly more positive movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece is mixed. While Cliff Asness's large position in AAPL is bullish, his overall market outlook is cautious.  Positive factors include Asness's strong performance, Apple's Q4 revenue growth, and Evercore ISI's positive rating.  However, counterbalancing this is Madison Investment's underweight position in AAPL and the article's suggestion that other AI stocks might offer better returns. The previous predictions are quite varied, highlighting the uncertainty.  Considering the overall mixed signals and the absence of overwhelmingly positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, a relatively neutral probability distribution is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to Asness's significant holding and Apple's recent positive financial performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is generic and lacks specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and historical performance, while others remain neutral or slightly negative due to valuation concerns and lack of specific news. Considering the lack of direct impact from the news and the balanced sentiment from previous predictions, the probabilities are assigned cautiously.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's past performance, its current business model transition towards services, and the potential for future growth. However, it also mentions that the valuation has become richer with a P/E ratio of 38.4, up from 25 five years ago, and that unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years. The article concludes that Apple has a powerful brand and the ability to produce free cash flow, but it also notes that the stock price has jumped nearly 200% in the past five years, supported by significantly higher earnings per share. Considering these factors, there seems to be a balanced view but with a slightly negative tilt due to the rich valuation and the potential for a market correction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc., as Warren Buffett is a highly respected and successful investor. Although the news does not provide any new or groundbreaking information about Apple's current performance or future prospects, the endorsement from Buffett can increase investor confidence and potentially drive up the stock price. Considering the positive sentiment and the lack of negative information, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. Additionally, analyzing the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly positive to neutral sentiments, which also supports the estimation of a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline about investing in consumer durables stocks generally carries a positive connotation, particularly for a major player like Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the lack of specific information regarding Apple's performance, recent developments, or market conditions contributes to a cautious outlook. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment overall, with some leaning slightly positive due to strong performance and investor confidence, while others highlight valuation concerns. Given this context, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, while also accounting for the cautious sentiment reflected in other analyses.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's largest holdings, including Apple. The investor's detailed and overwhelmingly positive experiences and insights into Apple's resilience, growth in its services sector, strong market position, and historical returns, all serve to positively reinforce its investment appeal. Also, although the news doesn't directly highlight Apple's future plans or financials, it emphasizes the enduring value of holding AAPL long-term, citing significant gains since 2008. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, but I am opting for slightly higher probability of rise this time. The mention of not selling too early and buy and hold principle add to the bullish sentiment. Thus, I predict the stock is more likely to increase slightly than decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook on Apple.  A significant positive is the large investment in AAPL by Cliff Asness, a well-respected value and momentum investor.  Asness's firm, AQR Capital Management, holds a substantial $1.87 billion stake.  This suggests confidence in Apple's future.  Furthermore, Apple's Q4 2024 results showed revenue growth and strong operating cash flow. Evercore ISI's positive rating and the strong performance of the App Store also contribute to a positive sentiment. However, counterbalancing these positives is Madison Investments' underweight position in AAPL and the article's suggestion that other AI-focused stocks may offer potentially higher returns.  The overall market sentiment expressed by Asness is also cautious. The previous predictions show a range of opinions but mostly leaned slightly positive, before the last round showing more neutral to negative outlook.  Considering the mixed signals and the absence of overwhelmingly positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, a relatively neutral probability distribution is appropriate, with a slight leaning towards a price rise due to Asness's significant investment and Apple's recent positive performance, but tempered by the less enthusiastic opinions of other analysts and the overall market uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is generic and lacks specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and historical performance, while others remain neutral or slightly negative due to valuation concerns and lack of specific news. Considering the lack of direct impact from the news and the balanced sentiment from previous predictions, the probabilities are assigned cautiously. The general bullish trend towards consumer durables and Apple's established position in that market leads to a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but the lack of specific positive catalysts keeps the prediction conservative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Apple's past performance, its transition towards services, and future growth potential. While Apple's services segment is growing rapidly with a high gross margin, the company's valuation has become richer with a P/E ratio of 38.4, up from 25 five years ago. The article concludes that unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years. Considering the mixed sentiment from previous predictions and the rich valuation, there seems to be a balanced view but with a slightly negative tilt.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc., as Warren Buffett is a highly respected and successful investor. This endorsement can increase investor confidence and potentially drive up the stock price. Analyzing the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly positive to neutral sentiments, which also supports the estimation of a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the lack of specific new information about Apple's current performance or future prospects tempers this optimism. Given the balance of positive sentiment from the Buffett endorsement and the mixed but generally cautious predictions from other models, a moderate estimation of probabilities is warranted.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is broad and offers no specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments based on varying factors including market conditions, Apple's services segment resilience, market experts' views, and concerns about the stock's valuation. Considering the current mix of bullish and bearish indications and the neutral nature of the news provided, the overall sentiment remains somewhat cautious.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
