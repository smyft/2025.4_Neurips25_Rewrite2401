(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including operating cash flow and significant investments in AI. Apple's commitment to integrating AI technologies within their product ecosystem and positive ranking among Blackrock's AI stocks supports a bullish outlook. However, there is also caution from analysts regarding valuations and potential market volatility driven by broader tech sector dynamics. Given the favorable developments for Apple, the probability of the stock price rising is high, but the caution in the overall market must temper the outlook for any potential declines.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's largest portfolio holdings, which includes Apple (AAPL). The article indirectly gives a bullish outlook on Apple by highlighting the resilience of its services segment, its strong position in the smartphone market, and the historical returns of the stock. The mention of steady high returns increases confidence. The article is published by The Motley Fool. While this isn't direct company news, it's an analyst's positive view expressed on a public platform, which could generate positive sentiment although the main theme of such portfolio review doesn't immediately dictate positive or negative outlook towards the stock. Therefore, a slight positive influence is expected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?\", is a highly generic question and offers no specific information about Apple's current financial performance or future prospects.  It does not contain any positive or negative news that would directly influence the stock price. Therefore, any stock price movement in response to this headline is unlikely to be significant.  The probability of a price rise or fall attributable to this news is considered negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,' which implies a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. Warren Buffett's endorsement is generally seen as a strong vote of confidence, which could attract investor interest and drive the stock price up. However, the headline is quite generic and does not provide specific new information or catalysts that would significantly impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not dramatically so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI space, mentioning both positive and negative developments. Apple's AI feature, Apple Intelligence, has faced criticism for spreading misinformation, leading to its suspension. However, the article also highlights Apple's ongoing efforts in AI and its ranking as the second must-watch AI stock on investors' radar. The overall sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive, as it acknowledges Apple's potential in AI while also noting challenges. The article does not contain any groundbreaking news that would significantly alter Apple's stock price trajectory in the short term. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financials, investments in AI, and innovative products such as the iPhone 16, which suggests a positive outlook for the company. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple is a prime investment opportunity and is ranked 6th on the list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. However, it also notes that some AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Overall, the positive tone of the article and the company's strong fundamentals suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past and present success in both hardware and services segments. However, it also points out the maturing nature of the iPhone market and the difficulty of achieving outsized growth in the future. While Wall Street predicts a modest annualized EPS growth of 11.4%, there is concern about a potentially contracting P/E ratio, which suggests limited potential for stock price appreciation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including substantial operating cash flow and significant investments in AI, which are likely to attract investor interest. Additionally, Apple's innovative products and positive ranking among Blackrock's AI stocks further support a bullish outlook. However, analysts express caution regarding overall tech sector dynamics, valuations, and market volatility, which tempers the enthusiasm. Taking these factors into consideration, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising due to the favorable developments surrounding Apple, but a moderate risk remains for a potential decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article presents a long-term investor's perspective on their largest holdings, including Apple. It highlights Apple's resilience, strong performance, and continued growth in its service segment. The investor's experience of holding Apple since 2008 and seeing a significant return (4,120%) is a positive signal. The mention of the iPhone's dominance and the fact that the stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 since joining the $1 trillion club in 2018 indicates underlying strength. While the article acknowledges past investor concerns, it emphasizes the importance of long-term holding and resisting the urge to sell prematurely. This points towards an increased confidence and stability for long-term investors, and overall provides more positive signals than negative ones, and considering the trend of previous predictions, I think the current prediction should be within the range of the past predictions. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' provides no specific information to inform a stock price prediction.  The previous predictions offer a range of opinions, mostly leaning slightly bullish but with significant uncertainty.  Several models highlight Apple's strong fundamentals (financial performance, AI investments) and market position, suggesting potential for growth; however, counterarguments exist regarding market volatility, valuation concerns, and the potential for slower future growth in mature markets.  The lack of concrete news in the headline makes it difficult to ascribe any significant probability to a price rise or fall directly caused by this headline alone. The consensus from previous models, while slightly bullish, isn't overwhelmingly so, indicating the inherent uncertainty surrounding long-term stock price predictions. Therefore, I assign probabilities reflecting this uncertainty, weighted slightly towards the previous models' average leaning towards a rise, but still emphasizing the lack of new impactful information from the headline itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' implies a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks, given Warren Buffett's reputation as a value investor. This endorsement could attract investor interest and support the stock price. However, the headline is generic and lacks specific new information or catalysts that would significantly impact the stock price. Previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with a general consensus leaning slightly towards a rise (average probability of ~0.6 for rise and ~0.4 for fall). The positive sentiment from Buffett's endorsement, combined with Apple's strong fundamentals and historical performance, supports a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the lack of concrete news and potential market volatility temper the outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI space, mentioning both positive and negative developments. Apple's AI feature, Apple Intelligence, has faced criticism for spreading misinformation, leading to its suspension. However, the article also highlights Apple's ongoing efforts in AI and its ranking as the second must-watch AI stock on investors' radar. The overall sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive, as it acknowledges Apple's potential in AI while also noting challenges. The article does not contain any groundbreaking news that would significantly alter Apple's stock price trajectory in the short term. However, previous predictions from various models indicate a generally positive outlook, with several models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. Considering the balanced view of Apple's AI efforts and challenges, and taking into account the previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, investments in AI, and innovative products, which suggests a positive outlook for the company. Additionally, Apple is ranked 6th on the list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks, indicating its potential in the AI space. However, the article also notes that some AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and there are cautions from analysts regarding valuations and potential market volatility. Considering the overall positive tone of the article, the company's strong fundamentals, and the trend of previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects of Apple's business model and performance, including hardware sales and the growing importance of services. While Apple's strong brand, cash flow, and current dominance in the market are highlighted, concerns about maturing iPhone sales and potential valuation adjustments are noted. Analysts predict moderate EPS growth and highlight the risk of a P/E ratio contraction, limiting significant stock price appreciation. The mix of positive and cautious sentiments reflects a balanced expectation with a slight tilt towards stability, given the historical and projected financial performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
