(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple Inc.'s sustained dominance and resilience in the market, particularly highlighting the growth of its services segment even amidst potential slowdowns in iPhone sales. The overall positive outlook for Apple's revenues and its strong market positioning suggest that investors remain confident in Apple's long-term growth potential. This favorable perception is likely to drive the stock price upward, especially as the company has historically shown notable returns and has a strong track record. The risk factors mentioned seem to be mitigated by the company's ongoing innovation and strong brand loyalty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While acknowledging Apple's past success and the ongoing shift towards higher-margin services, it emphasizes a potentially slower growth rate in the future due to the maturity of the iPhone market and a potentially contracting P/E ratio. The analyst consensus of 11.4% EPS growth over the next three years is decent, but the article suggests this may not translate into strong stock returns unless the valuation drops. Furthermore, the article highlights that Motley Fool's Stock Advisor doesn't consider Apple one of their top picks, hinting at better opportunities elsewhere. Given the concerns about slowing growth and high valuation, a decline in the stock price is somewhat more probable than a significant rise in the short term, based solely on this news. The article's overall tone is cautious, suggesting limited upside.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price over the next five years.  While acknowledging Apple's strong brand, consistent profitability, and growth in its services sector, the analysis highlights concerns about slowing growth in hardware sales, a high P/E ratio, and the maturity of the iPhone market.  The analyst's prediction of a 34% increase in stock price over five years is considered modest given past performance, suggesting that significant further price appreciation is unlikely without a substantial decrease in valuation or surpassing of growth expectations.  The article also mentions that Apple wasn't among the Motley Fool's top 10 stock picks, further dampening expectations of outsized returns. Considering these factors, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a greater likelihood of less dramatic growth or even a slight fall than a substantial increase.  The probabilities are assigned assuming a continuation of the current market trends and no significant unforeseen events.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's top five portfolio holdings heading into 2025, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of them. The author highlights Apple's resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the global smartphone market despite slowing iPhone sales. The article also emphasizes the long-term success of Apple's stock, with a 4,120% return since the author's first purchase in 2008. Given the positive sentiment and the author's conviction in Apple's future growth, this news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, the article does not present any new, groundbreaking information about Apple that would significantly alter its stock price in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately positive, while the probability of a fall is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) strong financials, AI integration, and groundbreaking innovations in iOS and iPhone. The company has shown positive financial growth, generating nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow and returning over $29 billion to shareholders. Apple's introduction of Apple Intelligence and its new iPhone 16 model with AI advancements are expected to drive growth. Additionally, BlackRock and JPMorgan's optimistic views on AI stocks and their potential for future growth support AAPL's investment potential. However, JPMorgan also cautions about valuation discrepancies and potential volatility if earnings expectations are not met. Overall, the positive aspects of AI integration and financial performance seem to outweigh the potential risks, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple Inc. as one of the Warren Buffett stocks to hold forever, which is a positive endorsement from a highly respected investor. This can lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive up the stock price. Warren Buffett's investment strategy is well-known for its long-term focus and value investing approach, which can attract long-term investors and reinforce the stability of the stock.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-known and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness' involvement often brings attention and confidence to the stocks he backs. Moreover, Apple has strong financial metrics, robust product launches, and recent positive developments like growing App Store revenues. Additionally, the news mentions a strong buy recommendation from analysts and positive financial results. However, the company is facing volatility and was called out for weaker-than-expected growth in recent quarters. There are also broader worries expressed about high U.S. stock market valuations that might impact Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article emphasizes Apple's resilience as a leading company, showcasing its strong performance, particularly in the services segment, despite potential challenges in hardware sales. While the product segment, especially iPhones, is facing maturity, the overall long-term growth perspectives remain positive. Analysts' varied predictions indicate that investor sentiment is mixed, but the prevailing view leans towards optimism, supported by Apple's historical performance and brand loyalty. The presence of influential figures investing in Apple suggests confidence in its growth, which coupled with substantial past returns points to a higher probability of stock price rise, even if there are recognized risks. Therefore, given this context and taking into account previous predictions that show a tendency towards optimism, I estimate a higher probability for stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple's future potential. While it acknowledges Apple's strong brand, successful transition towards services, and consistent cash flow, it also raises concerns about slowing hardware growth, a high P/E ratio, and the maturity of the iPhone market. The consensus EPS growth forecast is moderate, and the article explicitly states that outsized growth is unlikely unless the valuation drops. The fact that Motley Fool's Stock Advisor doesn't include Apple as a top pick further tempers expectations. Recent rounds' predictions show a varied opinion, with some leaning more positive and others negative. Considering the relatively neutral tone of the article and the historical trend, I will slightly increase probability of fall towards 0.45, considering that several similar predictions were between 0.35-0.4. Note that since recent predictions don't vary greatly, I will try not to change other values substantially. Given the information, a moderate increase in the probability of a fall seems appropriate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a nuanced outlook on Apple's future stock performance. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand, consistent profitability, and growth in services, it also highlights significant headwinds.  The projected 34% increase over five years is modest compared to past performance and hinges on continued growth and a potential P/E ratio contraction. The article's mention of the Motley Fool not including Apple in their top 10 picks further suggests limited upside potential in the short term.  The mature iPhone market and high P/E ratio present considerable risks.  However, Apple's robust services sector and continued innovation offer a degree of resilience. Considering the previous predictions, there's a spread of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others a fall.  The cautious tone of the article and the potential for slower growth suggest a probability of price rise slightly below 50%. The probabilities presented incorporate the uncertainty reflected in the article and the divergence of previous predictions, reflecting the need for a cautious approach.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the global smartphone market despite slowing iPhone sales. The author's long-term success with Apple's stock, with a 4,120% return since their first purchase in 2008, adds credibility to the positive sentiment. Additionally, the article emphasizes the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing, which could reinforce investor confidence in AAPL. However, the article does not present any groundbreaking new information that would significantly alter the stock price in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also show a generally positive sentiment, with most assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise than a fall. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately positive, while the probability of a fall is lower.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong financials, AI integration, and groundbreaking innovations in iOS and iPhone. The company has shown positive financial growth, generating nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow and returning over $29 billion to shareholders.

Overall, the positive aspects of AI integration and financial performance seem to outweigh the potential risks, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple Inc. as one of the Warren Buffett stocks to hold forever, which is a positive endorsement from a highly respected investor. This can lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive up the stock price. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of moderately positive to positive predictions, with most models assigning a higher probability to the stock price rising. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the lack of groundbreaking negative information, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) continued dominance and resilience, backed by respected investors like Cliff Asness and Warren Buffett. Despite concerns about slowing growth and high valuations, recent positive developments such as increasing App Store revenues, strong financial metrics, and positive analyst recommendations contribute to a generally positive outlook. However, the company faces some volatility and broader market concerns which temper expectations for substantial short-term gains.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
