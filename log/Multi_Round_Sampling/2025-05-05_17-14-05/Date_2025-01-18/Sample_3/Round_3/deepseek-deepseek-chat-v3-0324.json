(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that Cliff Asness, a respected figure in the investment community, is bullish on Apple Inc., which generally signals positive sentiment that could attract investor interest. AQR Capital Management holds a significant stake in Apple, indicating institutional confidence in the company's performance. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including a revenue increase and positive projections from analysts, supports a favorable outlook. Although there are mentions of general market concerns and a competitive AI landscape, the overall sentiment and financial data suggest a higher likelihood of price appreciation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration across its product lines (iOS 18, iPhone 116), and significant investment in AI. These are strong indicators of future growth potential. However, the article also presents some cautionary notes from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding the broader AI market, highlighting potential overvaluation of certain tech stocks and a possible 'catch down' scenario if the broader corporate universe doesn't adopt AI technologies as quickly as anticipated. Furthermore, the article emphasizes that while Apple is a good investment, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, suggesting Apple's AI play might be more gradual and less explosive. A number of hedge fund holders is a slightly positive sentiment. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase due to the positive AI developments and strong financials, but the risk of a market correction and relative underperformance in the AI space is also significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would 'hold forever'.  While positive sentiment is implied by Buffett's long-term investment strategy (suggesting strong fundamentals and future growth potential), the news itself is not specific to Apple's recent performance or future prospects. It's a general statement about long-term holding, not a catalyst for immediate price movement. Therefore, the headline's impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The probability of price movement in either direction is primarily driven by other market factors that are not considered here. We assume a near-neutral probability for both price increase and decrease, with a slight upward bias given the generally positive connotation of Buffett's endorsement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is a personal reflection on the author's investment portfolio and the lessons learned from holding stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL) over the long term. It highlights Apple's resilience, strong services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market despite challenges. The tone is positive and reinforces the idea that Apple remains a strong investment. However, the article does not provide any new, material information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative and forward-looking, suggesting a neutral to potentially positive outlook for Apple's stock price over a long-term period. The article likely discusses various factors that could influence Apple's stock performance, such as innovation, market trends, and financial health. Given that the article speculates on a 5-year horizon, it may highlight Apple's growth opportunities and resilience, which could lead to a positive perception among investors. However, without specific details on the content, the neutral nature of the headline suggests a balanced view. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to this news, assuming the article presents a positive or optimistic view of Apple's future.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news article, which highlights Apple Inc.'s strong financials, AI integration, and groundbreaking innovations in iOS and iPhone. The article mentions BlackRock's positive outlook on AI investments and Apple's position as a prime investment opportunity. It also notes JPMorgan's report on the AI revolution and the potential for AI-driven growth. Given the positive tone and emphasis on Apple's AI advancements, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-known and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness' involvement often brings attention and confidence to the stocks he backs. Moreover, Apple has strong financial metrics, robust product launches, and recent positive developments like growing App Store revenues. Additionally, the news mentions a strong buy recommendation from analysts and positive financial results. However, the company is facing volatility and was called out for weaker-than-expected growth in recent quarters. There are also broader worries expressed about high U.S. stock market valuations that might impact Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of a list of top stock recommendations, suggesting strong institutional confidence which typically attracts investor interest. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including a revenue increase, solid App Store growth, and a strong buy rating from analysts, supports a positive outlook. Although there are concerns regarding the broader market environment and competition in AI, the overall sentiment appears favorable due to Asness's backing and Apple's robust fundamentals. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL), highlighting its strong financials, AI integration, and innovative products. BlackRock's emphasis on AI investments and JPMorgan's identification of AI-related opportunities further support a bullish stance. Apple's integration of AI into its products (iOS 18, iPhone 116) and substantial investment in AI technologies signal future growth potential. However, the article also contains some caution, with BlackRock and JPMorgan pointing out potential overvaluation in certain tech stocks and warning of a possible 'catch down' scenario if AI adoption isn't broad-based. The number of hedge fund holders is also a slightly positive sentiment. Considering this, the overall analysis points towards a higher likelihood of a price increase, though not overwhelmingly so, given the market risks mentioned. The previous rounds of prediction are mostly between 0.55 and 0.7, which I will use as a reference. Considering the information, the probability of rise will be slightly higher than the average number in the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,' is positive but lacks specific details about Apple.  While associating Apple with Buffett's long-term investment strategy suggests confidence in its fundamentals, it's not a strong catalyst for immediate price movement.  The previous predictions range from a neutral stance (0.55 probability of rising) to a more positive outlook (0.75 probability of rising). The varied reasoning highlights the absence of concrete news driving a significant change.  Considering the lack of specific positive or negative information about Apple in this news piece and the range of predictions from previous models, a neutral to slightly positive outlook seems appropriate. The weight given to prior models' estimations emphasizes the absence of a decisive factor in this headline on Apple's stock price. I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of rising due to the generally positive association with Warren Buffett's investment choices. but the effect is likely small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article provides a personal reflection on the author's investment portfolio, highlighting Apple Inc.

However, the article does not present any new, material information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Given the positive sentiment but lack of immediate catalysts, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions also indicate a generally favorable outlook, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' suggests a forward-looking and speculative outlook on Apple's stock performance. The various predictions from different models indicate a generally positive but cautious sentiment. Many models highlight Apple's strong financials, AI integration, and positive analyst outlooks as factors contributing to a potential stock price increase. However, some models also mention market concerns, potential overvaluation, and the competitive AI landscape as factors that could lead to a stock price decrease. Considering the overall positive tone and the emphasis on long-term growth potential, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s strong financials, AI integration, and groundbreaking innovations in iOS and iPhone, which are positive indicators for the company's future growth. The article also mentions BlackRock's positive outlook on AI investments and Apple's position as a prime investment opportunity. Additionally, JPMorgan's report on the AI revolution suggests potential for AI-driven growth. Considering these factors and the overall positive tone of the article, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to this news. However, the article also notes that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, which could slightly temper the positive outlook for Apple. Based on the analysis of the provided news and the trends in previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a highly respected and successful investor, holds Apple Inc.

There are also broader worries expressed about high U.S. stock market valuations that might impact Apple. Overall, the positive aspects seem to outweigh the negatives.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc., indicating strong institutional confidence which can attract investor interest. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance is solid, with growth in revenue and positive analyst ratings. Although there are general market concerns and competition in AI, the overall sentiment, reinforced by Asness's support and positive financial metrics, points towards a higher likelihood of price appreciation. Recent predictions from various models mostly suggest probabilities leaning towards a price increase, therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's strong financials, AI integration (Apple Intelligence, iOS 18, iPhone 116), and backing from major investment firms like BlackRock and JPMorgan. These factors are generally positive indicators for a stock's performance. While the news mentions potential risks of AI overvaluation and a \"catch down,\" the overall tone is bullish on Apple's AI prospects, particularly in the long term. Previous rounds of predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with means varying around 0.65. I will continue increasing the probability of stock price rise. Taking this into consideration, a rise probability is reasonable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline, '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever', is positive but lacks specific details about Apple's current performance or future prospects.  The mention of Buffett's investment strategy implies a long-term positive outlook, suggesting strong fundamentals and potential for future growth. However, the headline itself is not a catalyst for immediate price movements.  Analyzing previous predictions reveals a range of probabilities, from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price rise, reflecting a generally positive sentiment towards Apple, largely based on its strong fundamentals, AI integration, and favorable analyst ratings. However, there are also concerns about market conditions, potential overvaluation, and competition. Considering the absence of concrete new information and the consensus from previous predictions, a slightly above-neutral probability of price increase seems justified. The previous rounds show a slight upward trend in the predicted probability of a price rise. I am incorporating that trend into my own prediction while acknowledging the inherent limitations of interpreting such vague news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a personal reflection on the author's investment portfolio, with Apple Inc.
