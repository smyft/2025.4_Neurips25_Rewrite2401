While positive sentiment is implied by Buffett's long-term investment strategy (suggesting strong fundamentals and future growth potential), the news itself is not specific to Apple's recent performance or future prospects. It's a general statement about long-term holding, not a catalyst for immediate price movement. Therefore, the headline's impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The probability of price movement in either direction is primarily driven by other market factors that are not considered here. We assume a near-neutral probability for both price increase and decrease, with a slight upward bias given the generally positive connotation of Buffett's endorsement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
