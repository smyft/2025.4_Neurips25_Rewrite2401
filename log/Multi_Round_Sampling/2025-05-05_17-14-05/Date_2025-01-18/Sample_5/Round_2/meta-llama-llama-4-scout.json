(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The headline focuses on a long-term question about Apple's stock price over a five-year horizon, which suggests that the topic is speculative in nature and lacks immediate actionable information for investors. Such discussions can often lead to mixed interpretations and uncertainty in the market. Additionally, there\u2019s no direct news or events that would strongly influence stock price movements in the near term. Therefore, I estimate a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards price stability rather than significant movements in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While acknowledging Apple's past success and the ongoing shift towards higher-margin services, it highlights concerns about slowing hardware growth and a currently high P/E ratio. The article also presents a projected annualized EPS growth of 11.4%, and notes that analysts expect the stock price will increase only 34% between now and the start of 2030. Considering that the Motley Fool's Stock Advisor does not include Apple in its 10 best stocks for investors to buy now, the overall tone is somewhat bearish. Given the current valuation and mature market, the potential for a significant price drop is more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price over the next five years.  While acknowledging Apple's strong brand, consistent profitability, and growth in its services sector, the analysis highlights concerns about slowing growth in hardware sales, a high P/E ratio, and the possibility of slower EPS growth than previously experienced. The projection of a 34% increase in stock price over five years is fairly modest given its past performance, suggesting a potential for lower-than-expected returns. The article also mentions that the Motley Fool's analysts did not include Apple among their top 10 picks, further adding to the cautious sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be lower than the probability of a price fall or stagnation.  However, it's important to note that this analysis does not include external market factors, which could significantly influence the stock's price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including strong financial growth, significant AI integration, and groundbreaking innovations in its products. The company's investment in AI, particularly the introduction of Apple Intelligence and the new iPhone 116 with advanced AI features, positions it well in the competitive AI market. Additionally, Apple's robust financials, with $27 billion in operating cash flow and $29 billion returned to shareholders, indicate stability and attractiveness to investors. The partnership with OpenAI for free ChatGPT access further enhances its AI capabilities. Given these positive developments and Apple's strong market position, the stock is likely to experience upward movement. However, the broader market caution around AI spending and valuation discrepancies noted by JPMorgan could introduce some volatility, but the overall sentiment appears bullish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. as one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks to hold long-term, emphasizing its strong customer base, growing services business, and high margins. Buffett's endorsement and the company's solid financials are likely to boost investor confidence. However, the article also mentions that the stock has gotten expensive over the past year, which might temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the positive outlook on Apple's growth prospects, especially with the integration of AI features and the growing services revenue, suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's past performance and its potential for future growth. While the company has a strong brand and a wide range of successful products and services, its valuation has become richer, with a current P/E ratio of 38.4, which is relatively high. The article also notes that the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of Apple's sales, is becoming more mature and may not see the same level of growth in the future. Wall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years, but this growth may not be enough to justify the current valuation. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline poses a speculative question about the future trajectory of Apple's stock price, indicating uncertainty and generating mixed investor sentiments. The earlier predictions reflect a bearish sentiment due to high valuation concerns coupled with moderate expectations for growth, particularly in hardware. Some predictions highlight positives like Apple's strong market position and successful transition to services, while others caution about a high P/E ratio and market maturity leading to possible stagnation. Given this balance of perspectives, I estimate that there's more concern about the stock's ability to rise significantly in the near term, while some analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Therefore, I predict a higher likelihood of a price fall relative to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook. It acknowledges Apple's strong brand, shift towards services, and past performance but raises concerns about slowing hardware growth, a high P/E ratio, and modest future growth projections. The Motley Fool's lack of inclusion in their top 10 stock picks adds to the cautious sentiment. The previous round of predictions shows varied opinions, with some leaning bullish due to Apple's AI initiatives and Warren Buffet's endorsement, while others are bearish due to valuation concerns. Given the slightly more pessimistic tone of the news and the trend of recent model predictions, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price decrease or stagnation, but not a drastic one due to the strength of the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a nuanced outlook on Apple's future stock price, highlighting both positive and negative factors.  Positive aspects include a strong brand, successful product and service ecosystem, a transition to higher-margin services, and AI integration. However, concerns exist regarding slowing hardware growth, particularly in the mature iPhone market, and a high P/E ratio.  Analyst estimates project modest growth, and the Motley Fool's exclusion of AAPL from their top 10 picks adds to the cautious sentiment.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from a 25% to 75% chance of a price rise. Considering the balanced nature of the article and the wide range in prior predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise than a fall, reflecting the company's overall strength and the continuing growth of its services sector. However, the high P/E ratio and potential for slower growth in hardware sales suggest a significant chance of the stock price remaining relatively stable or even experiencing a small decline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights several positive aspects of Apple Inc. (AAPL), including strong financial growth, significant AI integration, and groundbreaking innovations in its products.

However, the broader market caution around AI spending and valuation discrepancies noted by JPMorgan could introduce some volatility, but the overall sentiment appears bullish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) by highlighting its strong customer base, growing services business, and high margins. Warren Buffett's endorsement of the stock, noting it as one of his favorite long-term holdings, adds to the positive sentiment. The article also mentions Apple's significant investment in AI, such as the introduction of Apple Intelligence, which is expected to drive future growth. However, it also notes that the stock has become expensive over the past year, which might temper some enthusiasm. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment appears to be bullish, but with a cautious note on valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price over the next five years, highlighting both positive and negative factors. On the positive side, Apple has a strong brand, a wide range of successful products and services, and a growing services sector. However, the article also notes that the company's valuation has become richer, with a current P/E ratio of 38.4, which is relatively high. Additionally, the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of Apple's sales, is becoming more mature and may not see the same level of growth in the future. Considering these factors and the projections provided by Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling. However, the overall sentiment is not strongly bearish, and the company's strong financials and innovative products suggest that the stock price is unlikely to fall significantly. Therefore, a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall are assigned.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple in the context of a list of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks to hold forever. This provides a generally positive sentiment around the company, which typically boosts investor confidence. However, several other analyses highlight concerns such as slowing hardware growth, a high P/E ratio, and tempered growth expectations, all of which pose risks for the stock price. The previous predictions have shown mixed sentiments, ranging from very optimistic to cautious and bearish. Considering these aspects, the current sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
