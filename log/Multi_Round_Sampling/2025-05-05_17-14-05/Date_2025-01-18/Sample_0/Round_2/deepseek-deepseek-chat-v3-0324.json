(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The headline suggests that Warren Buffett, a highly regarded investor, views certain stocks as solid long-term holds. If Apple Inc. (AAPL) is included among these stocks, it could lead to positive sentiment among investors, boosting demand and potentially raising the stock price. However, the lack of specific details about Apple in the headline means the impact is uncertain. Therefore, while there is a positive indication, it may not be substantial enough to guarantee a rise in stock price. Hence, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, although there is also a chance it could fall due to broader market conditions or investor sentiment not favoring the stock at this moment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple (AAPL) as a long-term investment based on Warren Buffett's investment philosophy and Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong brand loyalty, growing customer base, expansion in the services sector, revenue growth, and potential AI integration. The article mentions Buffett calling Apple \"better than any business Berkshire owns\". The positive sentiment around long-term value and growth, combined with Buffett's endorsement, is likely to create upward pressure on the stock price. The mention of potential \"Double Down\" opportunities also adds a small amount of positive support. However, it is crucial to note the article is from MotleyFool and could skew toward more positive sentiment in order to drive up demand and revenue.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?\", is a highly generic question and offers no specific information about Apple's current financial performance or future prospects.  It does not contain any information that would directly suggest a likely rise or fall in the stock price.  Therefore, the probability of a price change based on this news alone is essentially neutral.  Any price movement over the next five years would depend on numerous factors not mentioned in the headline, including overall market conditions, Apple's product innovation, competitive pressures, and macroeconomic factors. It's important to note this analysis is based solely on the headline and lacks other relevant data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong position in AQR Capital Management's portfolio and its robust financial performance. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's inclusion in AQR's top 10 holdings, signaling confidence from a reputable investor; 2) Strong Q4 2024 revenue growth (6% YoY) and operating cash flow ($27 billion); 3) Positive analyst outlook (Evercore ISI's Outperform rating and $250 price target); 4) Growth in services revenue, particularly the App Store (15% growth in December quarter). Negative factors are minimal but include underperformance in some quarters and market volatility. Overall, the news is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the Warren Buffett stocks to hold forever, which implies a positive sentiment towards the company's long-term prospects. This kind of endorsement from a renowned investor like Warren Buffett can boost investor confidence and potentially lead to a rise in the stock price. However, the news does not provide any specific, new, or significant information about Apple's financials, products, or services that would drastically impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financials, significant investments in AI, and innovative products such as the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence. The company's dedication to integrating AI across its product lines and its substantial investment in AI research and development are positive indicators for future growth. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple is considered a prime investment opportunity by prominent investment firms such as BlackRock and JPMorgan. However, the article also notes that some AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, which could potentially lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price if investors shift their focus to other companies. Overall, the positive outlook on Apple's financials and AI innovations outweighs the potential risks, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive endorsement of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Warren Buffett, a widely respected investor known for making long-term investment decisions. The sentiment surrounding Buffett's endorsement is likely to boost investor confidence and interest in Apple as a long-term hold. While there is no direct financial data or market-moving news provided, the inherent positive connotation of being attributed to Buffett and his investment philosophy leans towards a favorable outlook. Comparing with previous predictions, a consensus forms around a moderate-to-high probability of the stock price rising, while the chance of it falling remains low due to the strength of the endorsement. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher likelihood for a price rise than the previous predictions indicate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article is generally positive for Apple. It highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, Berkshire Hathaway's large holding despite some recent sales, Apple's growing customer base, and the potential for growth in services revenue and AI integration. The 'Double Down' recommendation for stocks with similar success stories as Apple (Netflix, NVDA) further boosts positive sentiment. Previous rounds also showed generally positive predictions. Considering these points, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high. There's still a possibility of a fall, perhaps due to profit-taking or broader market factors, but the overall sentiment is positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline is vague and provides no actionable information regarding Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions vary significantly, ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 for a price rise. This discrepancy highlights the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock price movements based on limited information. The absence of specific news related to Apple's performance makes it impossible to definitively predict a price movement.  While some previous models reference positive long-term prospects and endorsements from notable investors, these are not guarantees of short-term price changes. Considering the lack of substantial news and the wide range of previous predictions, I'll assign a neutral probability, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong position in AQR Capital Management's portfolio and its robust financial performance. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's inclusion in AQR's top 10 holdings, signaling confidence from a reputable investor; 2) Strong Q4 2024 revenue growth (6% YoY) and operating cash flow ($27 billion); 3) Positive analyst outlook (Evercore ISI's Outperform rating and $250 price target); 4) Growth in services revenue, particularly the App Store (15% growth in December quarter). Negative factors are minimal but include underperformance in some quarters and market volatility. Overall, the news is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is viewed positively by Warren Buffett, a highly regarded investor. This endorsement can boost investor confidence and potentially lead to a rise in the stock price. However, the lack of specific details about Apple in the headline means the impact is uncertain. Therefore, while there is a positive indication, it may not be substantial enough to guarantee a rise in stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general positive sentiment but with varying degrees of confidence. Based on this, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple (AAPL) as a prime investment opportunity, highlighting its strong financials, significant investments in AI, and innovative products such as the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence.

Additionally, the article mentions that Apple is considered a prime investment opportunity by prominent investment firms such as BlackRock and JPMorgan. While the article notes that some AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, the overall positive outlook on Apple's financials and AI innovations outweighs the potential risks. Considering the previous predictions, which show a trend of moderately to highly positive sentiment towards Apple's stock price, with probabilities of a rise ranging from 0.5 to 0.75, the current analysis suggests a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' has multiple positive predictions from other models suggesting a favorable outlook on Apple stock based on Warren Buffett's endorsement, strong financial performance, services revenue growth, AI investments, and overall positive analyst ratings. While the generic headline alone may not directly influence immediate price movements, it reflects a bullish sentiment and long-term confidence in the company. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability that the stock price could rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
