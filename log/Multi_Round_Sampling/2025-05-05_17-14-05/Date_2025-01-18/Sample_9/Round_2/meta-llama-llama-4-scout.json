(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc.'s sustained dominance in the market, despite challenges with iPhone sales and the broader economic climate. It highlights the resilience of Apple's services segment and the significant return on investment since 2018. Overall, the emphasis on long-term investment and Apple's continued success makes a favorable outlook likely. Hence, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher due to the strong fundamentals and positive sentiment. The risk of a price fall exists but is considered lower given the overall positive portrayal of Apple's performance and potential, as well as the investing lessons shared.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is inherently neutral. It doesn't contain any specific positive or negative information about Apple. The article itself (not provided) could contain bullish or bearish analysis. Without the actual content, it's impossible to make a definitive assessment. However, because the headline is framed as an analysis of future prospects, it could generate speculative interest, but equally concerns about long-term issues. Without the content, a rise or fall is equally likely. Therefore neutral estimates are selected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would 'hold forever'.  While positive sentiment is implied by Buffett's long-term investment strategy (suggesting strong fundamentals and future growth potential), the news itself is not specific to Apple's recent performance or future prospects. It's a general statement about long-term holding, not a catalyst for immediate price movement. Therefore, the headline's impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The probability of price movement in either direction is primarily driven by other market factors rather than this news alone. We assume a baseline probability of price increase/decrease based on the general market trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong performance, AI potential, and robust financials. Key positive indicators include: 1) AQR Capital Management's significant stake ($1.87 billion), 2) Evercore ISI's Outperform rating and $250 price target, 3) strong App Store revenue growth (15% YoY), 4) solid Q4 2024 revenue ($94.9 billion, +6% YoY), and 5) Apple's AI strategy and new iPhone launch driving investor excitement. Negative factors are minimal but include Madison Investments' underweight position and broader market concerns (high CAPE ratios). Overall, the news is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks to hold long-term. Buffett has expressed his confidence in Apple, noting it as 'better than any business Berkshire owns.' The article emphasizes Apple's growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and the potential for growth driven by its services business and integration of artificial intelligence features. These points are likely to positively influence investor sentiment and potentially drive the stock price up. However, the article also mentions that the stock has gotten expensive over the past year, which might temper some of the enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsement from Warren Buffett and the company's strong fundamentals are likely to have a greater impact than the caution about the stock's valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's largest portfolio holdings and the important investing lessons learned from each one. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the holdings, with the author highlighting its resilience and growth potential. The article does not contain any negative news or bearish sentiments about Apple. Instead, it presents a positive outlook, citing the company's strong services segment and its ability to top the global smartphone market. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the overall positive tone of the article and the lack of any negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the long-term performance and key factors supporting each company's continued success. Regarding Apple, the article emphasizes its resilience and leadership in various segments despite economic uncertainties and competitive pressures. The article does not present specific news about Apple that would directly impact its stock price in the near term, but it reinforces the company's strong historical performance and potential for future growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news emphasizes Apple's continued dominance and resilience in the market despite Macroeconomic challenges. It highlights the growth of Apple's services segment, which is a positive indicator for future earnings. Additionally, the overall tone of the article suggests a strong belief in long-term performance based on historical data, showcasing significant returns since 2018. Given this positive sentiment, I believe there is a higher probability of the stock price rising as investors may be encouraged by the stability and potential growth of Apple's services segment, countering concerns over slowing iPhone sales.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline itself is neutral, simply posing a question about Apple's future stock price. However, the consistent positive sentiment from previous rounds is a crucial factor. Multiple analyses highlighted positive aspects like Warren Buffett's endorsement, strong company fundamentals, growing services segment, and AI potential. Although some mentioned the stock being 'expensive,' the overarching view is bullish. Considering the accumulated positive information from previous rounds and the resilience portrayed in past analysis plus the neutral information of the new headline, I am adding a small nudge of positiveness. My prediction leans towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but not as high as the initial 0.75 suggested by some earlier models due the neutrality of the current headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,' mentioning Apple, is mildly positive.  However, it lacks specific details about Apple's current performance or future prospects.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it's a generalized endorsement of long-term investment rather than a news event.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise, but none definitively pointing to a significant movement in either direction. Therefore, my prediction considers both the overall positive sentiment expressed from previous models and the lack of concrete news.  I've adjusted the probabilities slightly upwards from a neutral baseline, reflecting the mostly positive sentiment surrounding Apple but acknowledging the lack of truly compelling news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc.

Negative factors are minimal but include Madison Investments' underweight position and broader market concerns (high CAPE ratios). Overall, the news is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's top picks for long-term holding. The article emphasizes Apple's strong performance, growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and the potential for growth driven by its services business and integration of artificial intelligence features. These points are likely to positively influence investor sentiment and potentially drive the stock price up. However, the article also mentions that the stock has gotten expensive over the past year, which might temper some of the enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsement from Warren Buffett and the company's strong fundamentals are likely to have a greater impact than the caution about the stock's valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the author's largest portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the company's resilience, growth potential, and strong services segment. The overall tone of the article is positive, with no negative news or bearish sentiments about Apple. Based on this analysis and considering the previous predictions from other models, which also indicated a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong fundamentals and positive investor sentiment, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple long-term positive aspects of Apple Inc., such as its leadership in various market segments, resilient services segment, and the company's strategic moves like AI and new iPhone launches. The article lacks any significant negative indicators and instead focuses on long-term investment strategies and the company's consistent performance over the years.
