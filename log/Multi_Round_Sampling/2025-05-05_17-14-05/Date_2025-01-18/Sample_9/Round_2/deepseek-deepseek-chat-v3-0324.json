(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc.'s sustained dominance in the market, despite challenges with iPhone sales and the broader economic climate. It highlights the resilience of Apple's services segment and the significant return on investment since 2018. Overall, the emphasis on long-term investment and Apple's continued success makes a favorable outlook likely. Hence, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher due to the strong fundamentals and positive sentiment. The risk of a price fall exists but is considered lower given the overall positive portrayal of Apple's performance and potential, as well as the investing lessons shared.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is inherently neutral. It doesn't contain any specific positive or negative information about Apple. The article itself (not provided) could contain bullish or bearish analysis. Without the actual content, it's impossible to make a definitive assessment. However, because the headline is framed as an analysis of future prospects, it could generate speculative interest, but equally concerns about long-term issues. Without the content, a rise or fall is equally likely. Therefore neutral estimates are selected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would 'hold forever'.  While positive sentiment is implied by Buffett's long-term investment strategy (suggesting strong fundamentals and future growth potential), the news itself is not specific to Apple's recent performance or future prospects. It's a general statement about long-term holding, not a catalyst for immediate price movement. Therefore, the headline's impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The probability of price movement in either direction is primarily driven by other market factors rather than this news alone. We assume a baseline probability of price increase/decrease based on the general market trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong performance, AI potential, and robust financials. Key positive indicators include: 1) AQR Capital Management's significant stake ($1.87 billion), 2) Evercore ISI's Outperform rating and $250 price target, 3) strong App Store revenue growth (15% YoY), 4) solid Q4 2024 revenue ($94.9 billion, +6% YoY), and 5) Apple's AI strategy and new iPhone launch driving investor excitement. Negative factors are minimal but include Madison Investments' underweight position and broader market concerns (high CAPE ratios). Overall, the news is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks to hold long-term. Buffett has expressed his confidence in Apple, noting it as 'better than any business Berkshire owns.' The article emphasizes Apple's growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and the potential for growth driven by its services business and integration of artificial intelligence features. These points are likely to positively influence investor sentiment and potentially drive the stock price up. However, the article also mentions that the stock has gotten expensive over the past year, which might temper some of the enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsement from Warren Buffett and the company's strong fundamentals are likely to have a greater impact than the caution about the stock's valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's largest portfolio holdings and the important investing lessons learned from each one. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the holdings, with the author highlighting its resilience and growth potential. The article does not contain any negative news or bearish sentiments about Apple. Instead, it presents a positive outlook, citing the company's strong services segment and its ability to top the global smartphone market. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the overall positive tone of the article and the lack of any negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the long-term performance and key factors supporting each company's continued success. Regarding Apple, the article emphasizes its resilience and leadership in various segments despite economic uncertainties and competitive pressures. The article does not present specific news about Apple that would directly impact its stock price in the near term, but it reinforces the company's strong historical performance and potential for future growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news emphasizes Apple's continued dominance and resilience in the market despite Macroeconomic challenges. It highlights the growth of Apple's services segment, which is a positive indicator for future earnings. Additionally, the overall tone of the article suggests a strong belief in long-term performance based on historical data, showcasing significant returns since 2018. Given this positive sentiment, I believe there is a higher probability of the stock price rising as investors may be encouraged by the stability and potential growth of Apple's services segment, countering concerns over slowing iPhone sales.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline itself is neutral, simply posing a question about Apple's future stock price. However, the consistent positive sentiment from previous rounds is a crucial factor. Multiple analyses highlighted positive aspects like Warren Buffett's endorsement, strong company fundamentals, growing services segment, and AI potential. Although some mentioned the stock being 'expensive,' the overarching view is bullish. Considering the accumulated positive information from previous rounds and the resilience portrayed in past analysis plus the neutral information of the new headline, I am adding a small nudge of positiveness. My prediction leans towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but not as high as the initial 0.75 suggested by some earlier models due the neutrality of the current headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,' mentioning Apple, is mildly positive.  However, it lacks specific details about Apple's current performance or future prospects.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it's a generalized endorsement of long-term investment rather than a news event.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise, but none definitively pointing to a significant movement in either direction. Therefore, my prediction considers both the overall positive sentiment expressed from previous models and the lack of concrete news.  I've adjusted the probabilities slightly upwards from a neutral baseline, reflecting the mostly positive sentiment surrounding Apple but acknowledging the lack of truly compelling news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong performance, AI potential, and robust financials. Key positive indicators include: 1) AQR Capital Management's significant stake ($1.87 billion), 2) Evercore ISI's Outperform rating and $250 price target, 3) strong App Store revenue growth (15% YoY), 4) solid Q4 2024 revenue ($94.9 billion, +6% YoY), and 5) Apple's AI strategy and new iPhone launch driving investor excitement. Negative factors are minimal but include Madison Investments' underweight position and broader market concerns (high CAPE ratios). Overall, the news is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's top picks for long-term holding. The article emphasizes Apple's strong performance, growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and the potential for growth driven by its services business and integration of artificial intelligence features. These points are likely to positively influence investor sentiment and potentially drive the stock price up. However, the article also mentions that the stock has gotten expensive over the past year, which might temper some of the enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsement from Warren Buffett and the company's strong fundamentals are likely to have a greater impact than the caution about the stock's valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the author's largest portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the company's resilience, growth potential, and strong services segment. The overall tone of the article is positive, with no negative news or bearish sentiments about Apple. Based on this analysis and considering the previous predictions from other models, which also indicated a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong fundamentals and positive investor sentiment, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple long-term positive aspects of Apple Inc., such as its leadership in various market segments, resilient services segment, and the company's strategic moves like AI and new iPhone launches. The article lacks any significant negative indicators and instead focuses on long-term investment strategies and the company's consistent performance over the years.
