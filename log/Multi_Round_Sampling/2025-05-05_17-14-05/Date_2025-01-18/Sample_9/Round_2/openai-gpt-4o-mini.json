(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc.'s sustained dominance in the market, despite challenges with iPhone sales and the broader economic climate. It highlights the resilience of Apple's services segment and the significant return on investment since 2018. Overall, the emphasis on long-term investment and Apple's continued success makes a favorable outlook likely. Hence, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher due to the strong fundamentals and positive sentiment. The risk of a price fall exists but is considered lower given the overall positive portrayal of Apple's performance and potential, as well as the investing lessons shared.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is inherently neutral. It doesn't contain any specific positive or negative information about Apple. The article itself (not provided) could contain bullish or bearish analysis. Without the actual content, it's impossible to make a definitive assessment. However, because the headline is framed as an analysis of future prospects, it could generate speculative interest, but equally concerns about long-term issues. Without the content, a rise or fall is equally likely. Therefore neutral estimates are selected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of two stocks Warren Buffett would 'hold forever'.  While positive sentiment is implied by Buffett's long-term investment strategy (suggesting strong fundamentals and future growth potential), the news itself is not specific to Apple's recent performance or future prospects. It's a general statement about long-term holding, not a catalyst for immediate price movement. Therefore, the headline's impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The probability of price movement in either direction is primarily driven by other market factors rather than this news alone. We assume a baseline probability of price increase/decrease based on the general market trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong performance, AI potential, and robust financials. Key positive indicators include: 1) AQR Capital Management's significant stake ($1.87 billion), 2) Evercore ISI's Outperform rating and $250 price target, 3) strong App Store revenue growth (15% YoY), 4) solid Q4 2024 revenue ($94.9 billion, +6% YoY), and 5) Apple's AI strategy and new iPhone launch driving investor excitement. Negative factors are minimal but include Madison Investments' underweight position and broader market concerns (high CAPE ratios). Overall, the news is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks to hold long-term. Buffett has expressed his confidence in Apple, noting it as 'better than any business Berkshire owns.' The article emphasizes Apple's growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and the potential for growth driven by its services business and integration of artificial intelligence features. These points are likely to positively influence investor sentiment and potentially drive the stock price up. However, the article also mentions that the stock has gotten expensive over the past year, which might temper some of the enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsement from Warren Buffett and the company's strong fundamentals are likely to have a greater impact than the caution about the stock's valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's largest portfolio holdings and the important investing lessons learned from each one. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the holdings, with the author highlighting its resilience and growth potential. The article does not contain any negative news or bearish sentiments about Apple. Instead, it presents a positive outlook, citing the company's strong services segment and its ability to top the global smartphone market. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the overall positive tone of the article and the lack of any negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the long-term performance and key factors supporting each company's continued success. Regarding Apple, the article emphasizes its resilience and leadership in various segments despite economic uncertainties and competitive pressures. The article does not present specific news about Apple that would directly impact its stock price in the near term, but it reinforces the company's strong historical performance and potential for future growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news emphasizes Apple's continued dominance and resilience in the market despite Macroeconomic challenges. It highlights the growth of Apple's services segment, which is a positive indicator for future earnings. Additionally, the overall tone of the article suggests a strong belief in long-term performance based on historical data, showcasing significant returns since 2018. Given this positive sentiment, I believe there is a higher probability of the stock price rising as investors may be encouraged by the stability and potential growth of Apple's services segment, countering concerns over slowing iPhone sales.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline itself is neutral, simply posing a question about Apple's future stock price. However, the consistent positive sentiment from previous rounds is a crucial factor. Multiple analyses highlighted positive aspects like Warren Buffett's endorsement, strong company fundamentals, growing services segment, and AI potential. Although some mentioned the stock being 'expensive,' the overarching view is bullish. Considering the accumulated positive information from previous rounds and the resilience portrayed in past analysis plus the neutral information of the new headline, I am adding a small nudge of positiveness. My prediction leans towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but not as high as the initial 0.75 suggested by some earlier models due the neutrality of the current headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever,' mentioning Apple, is mildly positive.  However, it lacks specific details about Apple's current performance or future prospects.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it's a generalized endorsement of long-term investment rather than a news event.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise, but none definitively pointing to a significant movement in either direction. Therefore, my prediction considers both the overall positive sentiment expressed from previous models and the lack of concrete news.  I've adjusted the probabilities slightly upwards from a neutral baseline, reflecting the mostly positive sentiment surrounding Apple but acknowledging the lack of truly compelling news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong performance, AI potential, and robust financials.

Negative factors are minimal but include Madison Investments' underweight position and broader market concerns (high CAPE ratios). Overall, the news is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's top picks for long-term holding. The article emphasizes Apple's strong performance, growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and the potential for growth driven by its services business and integration of artificial intelligence features. These points are likely to positively influence investor sentiment and potentially drive the stock price up. However, the article also mentions that the stock has gotten expensive over the past year, which might temper some of the enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsement from Warren Buffett and the company's strong fundamentals are likely to have a greater impact than the caution about the stock's valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the author's largest portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the company's resilience, growth potential, and strong services segment. The overall tone of the article is positive, with no negative news or bearish sentiments about Apple. Based on this analysis and considering the previous predictions from other models, which also indicated a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong fundamentals and positive investor sentiment, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple long-term positive aspects of Apple Inc., such as its leadership in various market segments, resilient services segment, and the company's strategic moves like AI and new iPhone launches. The article lacks any significant negative indicators and instead focuses on long-term investment strategies and the company's consistent performance over the years.
