(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's financial news reveals a strong overall performance in the past five years, with significant growth in both hardware and services. However, the company's rich valuation, with a P/E ratio above historical averages, indicates that future growth may be limited. While there is optimism around the services segment, concerns about maturity in hardware sales, particularly the iPhone, could hinder substantial stock price appreciation. Analysts project modest EPS growth but anticipate a potential contraction in the P/E ratio, suggesting that outsized returns may not be achievable in the near term. Hence, the probability of stock price rise is tempered by valuation concerns, while the potential for decline is minimized due to the company's strong brand and cash flow generation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration across its product lines (iOS 18, iPhone 116), and significant investment in AI. These are strong indicators of future growth potential. However, the article also presents some cautionary notes from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding the broader AI market, highlighting potential overvaluation of certain tech stocks and a possible 'catch down' scenario if the broader corporate universe doesn't adopt AI technologies as quickly as anticipated. Furthermore, the article emphasizes that while Apple is a good investment, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, suggesting Apple's AI play might be more gradual and less explosive. A number of hedge fund holders is a slightly positive sentiment. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase due to the positive AI developments and strong financials, but the risk of a market correction and relative underperformance in the AI space is also significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article is an opinion piece from an individual investor detailing their portfolio holdings and the reasoning behind their investment choices.  The article mentions Apple as one of their top five holdings. While it expresses positive sentiment towards Apple, highlighting its resilience and the strong performance of its services segment, the article doesn't contain any new information about company performance, upcoming product launches, or other relevant factors. The article primarily focuses on the investor's long-term buy-and-hold strategy, drawing lessons from past successes rather than offering prediction about future stock movements. Therefore, the news itself has minimal direct impact on the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling.  The probability is based on existing market conditions and Apple's overall performance, which are outside the scope of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's top portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and reflects on long-term investment strategies rather than providing new financial data or significant market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple highlights its resilience, strong services segment, and historical performance, but does not introduce any new catalysts or risks that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Given the lack of immediate positive or negative triggers, the stock price movement is likely to follow broader market trends or company-specific developments not covered in this article.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is quite general and does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or provide any company-specific information that could directly influence its stock price. Consumer durables stocks often include companies that produce goods that last over a long period, such as electronics, which includes Apple's product lineup. However, without specific news about Apple, the impact of this general industry-focused headline on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement probabilities remain close to their neutral state, but with a slight bias towards stability or positive movement due to the general positive outlook on consumer durables.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing the company's strong portfolio and growth potential. Asness is a well-known investor with a successful track record, and his endorsement of AAPL is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's strong revenue growth, operating cash flow, and shareholder payments, which further support a bullish outlook. However, it's worth noting that Asness also expressed concerns about the larger U.S. stock market and the potential for mediocre returns in the upcoming years. Overall, the positive sentiment towards AAPL and the endorsement from a reputable investor like Asness suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news presents a cautiously optimistic view on Apple's stock, highlighting strong historical performance and growth in both products and services. However, there are concerns about the company's high valuation and the maturity of the iPhone market, which could limit future stock price appreciation. The consensus among analysts suggests modest EPS growth but indicates that substantial returns may not be likely without a significant valuation drop. While the article suggests a potential for stock price increase due to the strength of Apple's ecosystem and brand, the risks associated with the current P/E ratio and market conditions temper optimistic projections. Therefore, there is a slight bias towards stock price appreciation due to the overall strong market sentiment around Apple, but it is weighted by concerns about valuation and market trends.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, AI integration across its products, and significant investments in AI. BlackRock's and JPMorgan's perspectives on the AI landscape provide both positive and cautionary notes. While Apple is viewed as a solid investment, other AI stocks might offer quicker, higher returns. The previous rounds' predictions show mixed opinions, with a slight overall leaning towards a stock price increase, although valuations and broader market conditions temper the enthusiasm. Given Apple's current AI advancements and financial stability, balanced by general concerns across the AI market, I will adjust from initial prediction to consider others' predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The provided news article is a personal account of an investor's portfolio holdings and investment strategies.  While it highlights Apple as a successful long-term investment and mentions its strong services segment and resilience, it doesn't offer any new information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. The article's focus is on the investor's buy-and-hold approach and the lessons learned from past experiences. Therefore, the news itself has minimal direct influence on the probability of Apple's stock price movement.  The probabilities are heavily influenced by the previous predictions, which range from a 0.45 to a 0.7 probability of a price rise, indicating a varied and mostly positive outlook, but also highlighting caution over overvaluation and broader market conditions.  The lack of new information in this specific article suggests the probabilities should remain relatively close to the existing consensus, with a slight upward bias towards a price increase given the overall positive sentiment reflected in past predictions.  However, the uncertainty implied by the range of previous predictions is maintained.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a personal investment perspective on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and historical performance. However, it does not introduce any new financial data, market-moving information, or immediate catalysts that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. The article's focus is on long-term investment strategies and lessons learned, rather than providing actionable insights for short-term stock price movements. Given the lack of immediate positive or negative triggers, the stock price movement is likely to follow broader market trends or company-specific developments not covered in this article. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a neutral to slightly positive outlook, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for a price rise, and 0.3 to 0.5 for a price fall. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is general and does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or provide any company-specific information that could directly influence its stock price. However, considering Apple's strong overall performance, significant growth in both hardware and services, and its resilience in the consumer durables market, there is a slightly positive outlook. The previous predictions from various models indicate a mixed but generally positive sentiment, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.45 to 0.7. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the generally positive market sentiment towards consumer durables, a balanced prediction would be slightly above neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a bullish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Cliff Asness, a well-known investor with a successful track record. Asness' endorsement, combined with Apple's strong revenue growth, operating cash flow, and shareholder payments, supports a positive sentiment towards the stock. However, it's also important to consider the potential risks and concerns mentioned, such as the larger U.S. stock market's potential for mediocre returns in the upcoming years. Given the positive sentiment from Asness and the company's strong financials, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. Additionally, considering the predictions from other models, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a slight bias towards a stock price increase, I will adjust my prediction to be somewhat conservative but still reflective of the overall positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news headline asks about where Apple's stock will be in 5 years, but does not provide concrete details or new information affecting the stock price. Previous predictions show a range of opinions from different models, with some emphasizing the strong financial performance and AI investment, while others focus on valuation concerns and market conditions. The most recent prediction from meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct reflects bullish sentiment due to a well-known investor\u2019s endorsement, despite concerns about broader market performance. Considering the mix of opinions and the lack of new actionable information, the probability of stock price rise and fall should be relatively balanced but slightly skewed towards a slight positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
