Consumer durables stocks often include companies that produce goods that last over a long period, such as electronics, which includes Apple's product lineup. However, without specific news about Apple, the impact of this general industry-focused headline on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement probabilities remain close to their neutral state, but with a slight bias towards stability or positive movement due to the general positive outlook on consumer durables.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
