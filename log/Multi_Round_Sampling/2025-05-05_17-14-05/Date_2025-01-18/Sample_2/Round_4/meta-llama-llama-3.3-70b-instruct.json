(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's financial news reveals a strong overall performance in the past five years, with significant growth in both hardware and services. However, the company's rich valuation, with a P/E ratio above historical averages, indicates that future growth may be limited. While there is optimism around the services segment, concerns about maturity in hardware sales, particularly the iPhone, could hinder substantial stock price appreciation. Analysts project modest EPS growth but anticipate a potential contraction in the P/E ratio, suggesting that outsized returns may not be achievable in the near term. Hence, the probability of stock price rise is tempered by valuation concerns, while the potential for decline is minimized due to the company's strong brand and cash flow generation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration across its product lines (iOS 18, iPhone 116), and significant investment in AI. These are strong indicators of future growth potential. However, the article also presents some cautionary notes from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding the broader AI market, highlighting potential overvaluation of certain tech stocks and a possible 'catch down' scenario if the broader corporate universe doesn't adopt AI technologies as quickly as anticipated. Furthermore, the article emphasizes that while Apple is a good investment, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, suggesting Apple's AI play might be more gradual and less explosive. A number of hedge fund holders is a slightly positive sentiment. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase due to the positive AI developments and strong financials, but the risk of a market correction and relative underperformance in the AI space is also significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article is an opinion piece from an individual investor detailing their portfolio holdings and the reasoning behind their investment choices.  The article mentions Apple as one of their top five holdings. While it expresses positive sentiment towards Apple, highlighting its resilience and the strong performance of its services segment, the article doesn't contain any new information about company performance, upcoming product launches, or other relevant factors. The article primarily focuses on the investor's long-term buy-and-hold strategy, drawing lessons from past successes rather than offering prediction about future stock movements. Therefore, the news itself has minimal direct impact on the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling.  The probability is based on existing market conditions and Apple's overall performance, which are outside the scope of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's top portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and reflects on long-term investment strategies rather than providing new financial data or significant market-moving information about Apple. The mention of Apple highlights its resilience, strong services segment, and historical performance, but does not introduce any new catalysts or risks that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Given the lack of immediate positive or negative triggers, the stock price movement is likely to follow broader market trends or company-specific developments not covered in this article.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is quite general and does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or provide any company-specific information that could directly influence its stock price. Consumer durables stocks often include companies that produce goods that last over a long period, such as electronics, which includes Apple's product lineup. However, without specific news about Apple, the impact of this general industry-focused headline on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement probabilities remain close to their neutral state, but with a slight bias towards stability or positive movement due to the general positive outlook on consumer durables.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing the company's strong portfolio and growth potential. Asness is a well-known investor with a successful track record, and his endorsement of AAPL is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's strong revenue growth, operating cash flow, and shareholder payments, which further support a bullish outlook. However, it's worth noting that Asness also expressed concerns about the larger U.S. stock market and the potential for mediocre returns in the upcoming years. Overall, the positive sentiment towards AAPL and the endorsement from a reputable investor like Asness suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news presents a cautiously optimistic view on Apple's stock, highlighting strong historical performance and growth in both products and services. However, there are concerns about the company's high valuation and the maturity of the iPhone market, which could limit future stock price appreciation. The consensus among analysts suggests modest EPS growth but indicates that substantial returns may not be likely without a significant valuation drop. While the article suggests a potential for stock price increase due to the strength of Apple's ecosystem and brand, the risks associated with the current P/E ratio and market conditions temper optimistic projections. Therefore, there is a slight bias towards stock price appreciation due to the overall strong market sentiment around Apple, but it is weighted by concerns about valuation and market trends.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, AI integration across its products, and significant investments in AI. BlackRock's and JPMorgan's perspectives on the AI landscape provide both positive and cautionary notes. While Apple is viewed as a solid investment, other AI stocks might offer quicker, higher returns. The previous rounds' predictions show mixed opinions, with a slight overall leaning towards a stock price increase, although valuations and broader market conditions temper the enthusiasm. Given Apple's current AI advancements and financial stability, balanced by general concerns across the AI market, I will adjust from initial prediction to consider others' predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The provided news article is a personal account of an investor's portfolio holdings and investment strategies.  While it highlights Apple as a successful long-term investment and mentions its strong services segment and resilience, it doesn't offer any new information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. The article's focus is on the investor's buy-and-hold approach and the lessons learned from past experiences. Therefore, the news itself has minimal direct influence on the probability of Apple's stock price movement.  The probabilities are heavily influenced by the previous predictions, which range from a 0.45 to a 0.7 probability of a price rise, indicating a varied and mostly positive outlook, but also highlighting caution over overvaluation and broader market conditions.  The lack of new information in this specific article suggests the probabilities should remain relatively close to the existing consensus, with a slight upward bias towards a price increase given the overall positive sentiment reflected in past predictions.  However, the uncertainty implied by the range of previous predictions is maintained.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a personal investment perspective on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its resilience, strong services segment, and historical performance. However, it does not introduce any new financial data, market-moving information, or immediate catalysts that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. The article's focus is on long-term investment strategies and lessons learned, rather than providing actionable insights for short-term stock price movements. Given the lack of immediate positive or negative triggers, the stock price movement is likely to follow broader market trends or company-specific developments not covered in this article. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a neutral to slightly positive outlook, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for a price rise, and 0.3 to 0.5 for a price fall. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is general and does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or provide any company-specific information that could directly influence its stock price. However, considering Apple's strong overall performance, significant growth in both hardware and services, and its resilience in the consumer durables market, there is a slightly positive outlook. The previous predictions from various models indicate a mixed but generally positive sentiment, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.45 to 0.7. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the generally positive market sentiment towards consumer durables, a balanced prediction would be slightly above neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a bullish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Cliff Asness, a well-known investor with a successful track record. Asness' endorsement, combined with Apple's strong revenue growth, operating cash flow, and shareholder payments, supports a positive sentiment towards the stock. However, it's also important to consider the potential risks and concerns mentioned, such as the larger U.S. stock market's potential for mediocre returns in the upcoming years. Given the positive sentiment from Asness and the company's strong financials, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. Additionally, considering the predictions from other models, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a slight bias towards a stock price increase, I will adjust my prediction to be somewhat conservative but still reflective of the overall positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news headline asks about where Apple's stock will be in 5 years, but does not provide concrete details or new information affecting the stock price. Previous predictions show a range of opinions from different models, with some emphasizing the strong financial performance and AI investment, while others focus on valuation concerns and market conditions. The most recent prediction from meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct reflects bullish sentiment due to a well-known investor\u2019s endorsement, despite concerns about broader market performance. Considering the mix of opinions and the lack of new actionable information, the probability of stock price rise and fall should be relatively balanced but slightly skewed towards a slight positive sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The financial news presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's future stock performance. Apple's strong historical growth and positive trends in the services segment provide a solid foundation for potential appreciation. However, the concerns about high valuation, particularly the elevated P/E ratio, and the maturity of the iPhone market may limit outsized returns over the next five years. Overall sentiment from various predictions leans slightly towards a stock price rise, but the risks associated with valuation keep the probabilities balanced. Given the mixed outlook and previous model predictions, I estimate a modest increase in the probability of the stock price rising, while recognizing the potential for a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts (Apple Intelligence, iOS 18, iPhone enhancements), and investments in AI, which are generally positive signals. However, it also presents cautionary notes from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding AI valuations and potential market corrections, suggesting some uncertainty in the broader AI space. The previous rounds' predictions show a slight overall leaning towards a stock price increase, with varying degrees of confidence. Considering these factors, plus the fact that this news piece seems to be a reiteration of already public knowledge as opposed to genuinely new information, I think a slight increase in probability of stock price appreciation is warranted, but not dramatically so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The provided news article is a personal account of an investor's portfolio holdings and investment strategies.  It does not contain any new information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. The article's focus is on the investor's long-term buy-and-hold approach and lessons learned from past experiences with several tech companies. While the article expresses positive sentiment towards Apple, highlighting its resilience and the strength of its services segment, this is not new information and doesn't provide a basis for significantly altering the probability of a price increase or decrease.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in predicting stock price movements.  Given this, and the lack of new information, I'll average the predictions from previous rounds, giving a slightly higher weight to the more recent rounds as more models adjust their opinion.  The overall sentiment remains slightly positive but cautious reflecting the general market sentiment and Apple's position within the market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news article discusses an investor's long-term portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc.

The previous predictions from various models indicate a mixed but generally positive sentiment, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.45 to 0.7. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the generally positive market sentiment towards consumer durables, a balanced prediction would be slightly above neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing the company's strong portfolio and growth potential. Asness is a well-known investor with a successful track record, and his endorsement of AAPL is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price.

However, it's worth noting that Asness also expressed concerns about the larger U.S. stock market and the potential for mediocre returns in the upcoming years. Considering the positive sentiment from Asness, the company's strong financials, and the previous predictions from other models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. The probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, reflecting the overall positive sentiment and strong financial performance of the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The financial news headline asks about where Apple's stock will be in 5 years, but does not provide concrete details or new information affecting the stock price. Previous predictions show a range of opinions from different models, with some emphasizing the strong financial performance and AI investment, while others focus on valuation concerns and market conditions. The most recent prediction from meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct reflects bullish sentiment due to a well-known investor\u2019s endorsement, despite concerns about broader market performance. Considering the mix of opinions and the lack of new actionable information, the probability of stock price rise and fall should be relatively balanced but slightly skewed towards a slight positive sentiment.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The financial news presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong historical performance and potential growth in the services segment, which is becoming an increasingly important part of the business model. While concerns about high valuations and the maturity of the iPhone market temper expectations for outsized returns, overall market sentiment remains positive due to Apple's brand strength and cash flow generation. The consensus among various predictions reflects a slight bias towards a stock price rise, though risks associated with valuation remain significant. Taking into account the previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article is mostly positive, highlighting Apple's financial strength, AI integration, and innovative iOS and iPhone features. However, it also references concerns about AI stock valuations from BlackRock and JPMorgan and mentions that other AI stocks might offer higher returns quicker. The previous rounds of predictions show a slight leaning towards a stock price increase, but there's caution due to valuation concerns and broader market conditions. Given this news is slightly lagged, I will average the predictions from previous rounds, giving a slightly higher weight to the trends as more models adjust their opinions. Given the absence of genuinely new information, I will maintain a slightly positive outlook, but temper it slightly given AI valuations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The provided news article is a personal account of an investor's portfolio holdings and investment strategies.  It does not contain any materially new information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. While the article expresses positive sentiment towards Apple, highlighting its resilience and the strength of its services segment, this is not new information and doesn't provide a basis for significantly altering the probability of a price increase or decrease.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock price movements. The consensus from the previous rounds leans slightly towards a price increase, reflecting the overall positive sentiment and strong financial performance historically associated with Apple.  However, concerns around high valuation and market conditions persist.  Considering the lack of new information, the overall positive but cautious sentiment from previous predictions, and the inherent uncertainty of the market, I am giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising compared to falling, but the difference is modest, reflecting the lack of impactful news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news article discusses an investor's long-term portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc.

Given the positive news and the overall strong market sentiment towards Apple, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.57,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.43\n}"
