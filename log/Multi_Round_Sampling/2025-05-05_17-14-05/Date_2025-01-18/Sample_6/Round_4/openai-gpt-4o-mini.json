(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc.'s sustained dominance in the market, despite challenges with iPhone sales and the broader economic climate. It highlights the resilience of Apple's services segment and the significant return on investment since 2018. Overall, the tone is positive about Apple's long-term prospects, which suggests an increased likelihood of stock price appreciation. Additionally, as part of an analysis of successful portfolio investments, the mention of Apple signifies continued investor confidence. Therefore, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline explicitly states that Apple (implied through Buffett's holdings) is one of two 'forever' stocks. This is a very positive sentiment, suggesting long-term confidence and stability. While not directly impacting immediate revenue, it enhances investor perception and might attract more long-term holders, potentially driving demand. Therefore, the positive sentiment outweighs any potential negative interpretations, leading to a higher probability of a price rise. It is noted that this effect is likely to be less pronounced due to Apple being a widely covered blue-chip stock, and also Buffett's positions will likely be priced into the market already.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\" is very general and doesn't offer specific information about Apple.  Consumer durables is a broad sector, and while Apple produces iPhones and other consumer electronics that fall under this category, the headline doesn't suggest any positive or negative catalysts specifically affecting Apple's stock price. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. The probabilities reflect this lack of directional influence.  The price movement will likely be driven by other factors not mentioned in this headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has shown strong historical performance with significant returns over the past five years, driven by its dominant hardware sales and growing services segment. However, the article highlights concerns about the company's future growth potential due to the maturity of the iPhone, a high current P/E ratio (38.4), and slower expected EPS growth (11.4% annualized). The services segment, while growing rapidly, may not offset the challenges in hardware sales. The article concludes that unless the valuation drops, Apple's stock may not generate strong returns over the next five years. Given this mixed outlook, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is slightly lower but still notable due to valuation concerns and growth headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative and forward-looking, suggesting a neutral to potentially positive outlook for Apple's stock price over a long-term horizon. The article likely discusses various factors that could influence Apple's stock performance, including potential growth areas such as new product launches, services expansion, and market trends. Given that the article speculates on a positive time frame ('in 5 years'), it may instill confidence in investors about Apple's long-term prospects, thereby having a more positive impact than a negative one.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative in nature and does not contain any specific positive or negative information about the company's current performance or future prospects. Therefore, it's unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price. However, given Apple's historical performance and its position as a market leader, there might be a slight positive bias in investor expectations, potentially leading to a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising compared to falling. Yet, without concrete news, these probabilities remain largely speculative and closer to a neutral assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position in the AI sector and discusses the company's efforts and challenges. The article notes the company's strong presence in AI with features like Apple Intelligence, but also points out issues with its notification summary feature causing mistrust and misinformation. There's positive sentiment towards Apple's AI innovations, as well as the mention of several hedge funds holding Apple's stock. However, the news also brings attention to a specific issue affecting the feature, which might cause short-term investor concern.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued dominance and resilience despite challenges in the smartphone market, emphasizing the growth of its services segment, which has been a consistent revenue driver. Apple's strong historical performance, with significant stock appreciation, enhances the positive sentiment among investors. Although concerns about growth due to iPhone maturity exist, the overall tone is optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising, although some caution is warranted due to potential near-term fluctuations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The headline \"2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\" is a strong endorsement, suggesting long-term confidence in the company. Previous models had a wide range of predictions, likely based on different interpretations and weighing of factors. The average was slightly skewed positively (around 0.55 rise, 0.45 fall). Given that this headline explicitly names Apple as a 'forever' stock, and taking into account the effect of sentiment from previous rounds, I would slightly increase the probability of a rise, but remember market has already priced in the effects of Buffett's endorsements to some extent.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The headline \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\" is incredibly vague and provides no specific information about Apple.  Previous predictions varied widely, reflecting the lack of directional information in the original prompt and highlighting the influence of other, unstated factors on stock price.  While some models leaned positive, referencing Apple's historical performance and market position as a blue-chip stock, others highlighted potential challenges including valuation concerns and competition.  Given the lack of concrete news impacting Apple specifically, and the significant divergence in prior predictions, I assess a neutral probability. The influence of this headline alone is likely minimal, with the actual price movement primarily driven by broader market forces, future earnings announcements, and other significant events.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) over the next five years. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong historical performance, dominant brand, and growing services segment, which now accounts for 25% of revenue and has high gross margins. The launch of Apple Intelligence and the ecosystem's strength are also noted as positive factors. However, concerns are raised about the maturity of the iPhone, a high current P/E ratio of 38.4 (which is historically expensive), and slower expected EPS growth of 11.4% annually. The article concludes that unless the valuation drops, Apple's stock may not generate strong returns over the next five years. Given this balanced view, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are close due to the mixed signals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news covers Apple Inc.'s role in the AI sector, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. The article notes the company's strong presence in AI with features like Apple Intelligence, as well as the challenges with its notification summary feature causing mistrust and misinformation. There's positive sentiment towards Apple's AI innovations, as evidenced by the mention of several hedge funds holding Apple's stock. However, the news item also points out a specific issue affecting the feature, which might cause short-term investor concern. The mixed sentiment in the news combined with previous predictions suggests a balanced outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued dominance as the most valuable company and its resilience in generating revenue through its services segment, even amidst challenges in smartphone sales. It emphasizes the substantial growth in Apple's stock since becoming a charter member of the $1 trillion club, exceeding the S&P 500 returns significantly. Despite some concerns regarding the maturity of iPhone sales and the company's high current P/E ratio, the overall tone is optimistic about its long-term prospects and the compounding power of buy-and-hold investing. As such, I assess a higher probability for stock price rise compared to fall, reflecting positive investor sentiment and historical performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\" is too generic to significantly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the limited influence of this headline and the importance of other, unstated factors. While some models leaned positive due to Apple's historical performance and market position,  others highlighted valuation concerns and growth headwinds.  The lack of specific information about Apple in the headline makes it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or a fall. I am, therefore, giving more weight to the more cautious predictions from previous rounds, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the potential influence of broader market forces.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a balanced view of Apple Inc.'s future prospects. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong historical performance, dominant brand, growing services segment (now 25% of revenue with high gross margins), and the launch of Apple Intelligence. However, concerns are raised about the maturity of the iPhone, a high current P/E ratio (38.4), and slower expected EPS growth (11.4% annually).

The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of sentiments, from positive to negative, reflecting the mixed outlook for Apple's future performance. Some models highlight Apple's strong historical performance, dominant market position, and growing services segment as positive factors. Others mention concerns about the maturity of the iPhone, high P/E ratio, and slower expected EPS growth as potential challenges. Given this mixed outlook and the lack of specific, actionable information in the headline, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative and forward-looking, suggesting a neutral to potentially positive outlook for Apple's stock price over a long-term horizon. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which are largely positive but with varying degrees of confidence, it seems that the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects. The resilience of Apple's services segment, its dominant market position, and the potential for future growth areas such as new product launches and services expansion contribute to this positivity. However, concerns about the maturity of the iPhone, valuation, and potential growth headwinds are also noted. Given the speculative nature of the headline and the balanced view from previous predictions, the probabilities of the stock price rising and falling are estimated with a slight bias towards a rise due to the overall positive sentiment towards Apple's long-term prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s role in the AI sector, including both strengths and weaknesses.

There's positive sentiment towards Apple's AI innovations, as evidenced by the mention of several hedge funds holding Apple's stock. However, the news item also points out a specific issue affecting the feature, which might cause short-term investor concern. The mixed sentiment in the news combined with previous predictions suggests a balanced outlook. The article's focus on AI innovations supports a positive outlook, but the recent suspension of problematic AI features introduces short-term uncertainty.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's dominant position and solid performance amid challenges in smartphone sales, particularly focusing on its robust services segment which continues to grow. The historical returns since 2018 and the overall positive sentiment about Apple's long-term prospects indicate a likelihood of appreciation in stock price. Although concerns around the maturity of the iPhone market and a high P/E ratio exist, the overall tone remains optimistic. Most previous predictions range from slightly positive to neutral, with many acknowledging both potential risks and rewards. Therefore, I estimate a relatively higher probability of the stock price rising based on the current information.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The news headline explicitly labels Apple as one of two 'forever stocks' according to Warren Buffett, signaling strong long-term confidence. This is further supported by previous rounds where the models leaned towards a positive outlook, citing Apple's resilience, growth in services, and overall market dominance. While concerns regarding iPhone maturity and valuation exist, the positive sentiment associated with Buffett's endorsement and the historical performance of the stock outweighs these concerns slightly. I am increasing the probability of a rise, but acknowledge that the 'Buffett effect' might already be partially priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks,\" is extremely generic and offers no specific information relevant to Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions demonstrate a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of directional influence from this headline and the dominance of other, unstated factors in determining Apple's stock price movement. While some models highlighted positive aspects like Apple's historical performance, market dominance, and resilient services sector, others emphasized concerns such as the maturity of the iPhone market, high valuation, and slower-than-expected EPS growth.  The consensus across multiple rounds shows a gradual shift towards a slightly more positive outlook, but the probabilities remain relatively close to a 50/50 split.  Given the vagueness of the headline and the significant divergence in previous predictions, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, reflecting the limited impact of this particular news piece on Apple's stock price. The actual movement is likely driven by broader market forces, future earnings reports, and other substantial events.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a balanced view of Apple Inc.'s future prospects.
