(AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\n\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant investment by Apple ($725 billion) that has led to a surge in earnings per share, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. The emphasis on non-tech-based investments suggests diversification, potentially mitigating risks associated with market volatility in the tech sector. Given this positive earnings report and substantial investment backing, the likelihood of the stock price rising is high. Conversely, the lack of direct connection to AI, which is a hot topic in tech, might not appeal to all investors, but the overall sentiment remains bullish.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights a general expectation of continued market growth in 2025, driven partly by anticipated business-friendly policies. Specifically for Apple, Rosenblatt Securities maintains a 'Buy' rating with a $262 price target. The company's focus on AI (Apple Intelligence) and services revenue shows proactive adaptation and is viewed positively by Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy, expecting meaningful growth. However, the article also acknowledges potential risks like uncertainty around Trump's policies and the possibility of market corrections. There's a mention of slower iPhone sales due to Chinese competition. Moreover, the article positions Apple lower than other AI stocks in terms of potential returns. Considering these factors, the outlook is slightly more positive than negative but far from a guaranteed rise because AI stocks show more promise for other companies. The potential market volatility also contributes to uncertainty. A 0.55 probability of rise reflects this cautiously optimistic view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with concerns about slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China (a key market), suggests a negative outlook for the company's short-term performance.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further support this. While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive surprises, the analyst's concerns about increasing competition and a lack of compelling AI features are significant headwinds.  The fact that the stock dipped immediately after the news release demonstrates an immediate negative market reaction.  However, Apple is a large, well-established company, and the probability of a significant, sustained fall might be limited. A slight rise is possible if the earnings report surpasses expectations, but the negative pre-earnings sentiment is substantial.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on ASML's positive earnings and the CEO's optimistic outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips, which are used in Apple's products. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities, likely resulting in a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, so the probability is moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses ASML's positive earnings report and its CEO's optimistic view on AI chip demand, which could have a positive impact on companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that rely on these chips. However, the article is primarily about ASML and its direct impact, not AAPL. The CEO of ASML dismissed concerns that a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek would hurt demand for AI chips, which could benefit AAPL as a major tech company using these chips. Given that the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than AAPL specifically, the impact on AAPL's stock price might be indirect. However, as a major customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's machines, AAPL could see a positive impact from increased demand for AI chips.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article mentions a collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong fiscal fourth quarter earnings could have a positive impact on the tech industry as a whole. However, the antitrust concerns regarding HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks may have a negative impact on the overall market sentiment. Given that the news about Apple is positive and there is no negative news about the company, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025. Despite his criteria focusing on quality companies with strong dividend yields, Apple meets these criteria well given its historical financial performance, stable balance sheet, and ongoing service offerings. Additionally, Apple's strong revenue performance, recent product releases such as the iPhone 16, and AI strategy provide a positive outlook. However, the volatility noted by Madison Investments and the potential risks associated with TikTok's operations in the U.S. introduce some uncertainties.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
