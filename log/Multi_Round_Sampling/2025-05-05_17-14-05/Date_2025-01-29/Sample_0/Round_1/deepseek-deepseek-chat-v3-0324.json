(AAPL)\nNews Headline: ASML stock rises after earnings beat as CEO says DeepSeek will drive AI chip demand higher\nNews Content: ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on January 29, 2025.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant investment by Apple ($725 billion) that has led to a surge in earnings per share, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. The emphasis on non-tech-based investments suggests diversification, potentially mitigating risks associated with market volatility in the tech sector. Given this positive earnings report and substantial investment backing, the likelihood of the stock price rising is high. Conversely, the lack of direct connection to AI, which is a hot topic in tech, might not appeal to all investors, but the overall sentiment remains bullish.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights a general expectation of continued market growth in 2025, driven partly by anticipated business-friendly policies. Specifically for Apple, Rosenblatt Securities maintains a 'Buy' rating with a $262 price target. The company's focus on AI (Apple Intelligence) and services revenue shows proactive adaptation and is viewed positively by Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy, expecting meaningful growth. However, the article also acknowledges potential risks like uncertainty around Trump's policies and the possibility of market corrections. There's a mention of slower iPhone sales due to Chinese competition. Moreover, the article positions Apple lower than other AI stocks in terms of potential returns. Considering these factors, the outlook is slightly more positive than negative but far from a guaranteed rise because AI stocks show more promise for other companies. The potential market volatility also contributes to uncertainty. A 0.55 probability of rise reflects this cautiously optimistic view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with concerns about slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China (a key market), suggests a negative outlook for the company's short-term performance.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further support this. While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive surprises, the analyst's concerns about increasing competition and a lack of compelling AI features are significant headwinds.  The fact that the stock dipped immediately after the news release demonstrates an immediate negative market reaction.  However, Apple is a large, well-established company, and the probability of a significant, sustained fall might be limited. A slight rise is possible if the earnings report surpasses expectations, but the negative pre-earnings sentiment is substantial.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on ASML's positive earnings and the CEO's optimistic outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips, which are used in Apple's products. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities, likely resulting in a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, so the probability is moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses ASML's positive earnings report and its CEO's optimistic view on AI chip demand, which could have a positive impact on companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that rely on these chips. However, the article is primarily about ASML and its direct impact, not AAPL. The CEO of ASML dismissed concerns that a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek would hurt demand for AI chips, which could benefit AAPL as a major tech company using these chips. Given that the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than AAPL specifically, the impact on AAPL's stock price might be indirect. However, as a major customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's machines, AAPL could see a positive impact from increased demand for AI chips.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article mentions a collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong fiscal fourth quarter earnings could have a positive impact on the tech industry as a whole. However, the antitrust concerns regarding HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks may have a negative impact on the overall market sentiment. Given that the news about Apple is positive and there is no negative news about the company, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025. Despite his criteria focusing on quality companies with strong dividend yields, Apple meets these criteria well given its historical financial performance, stable balance sheet, and ongoing service offerings. Additionally, Apple's strong revenue performance, recent product releases such as the iPhone 16, and AI strategy provide a positive outlook. However, the volatility noted by Madison Investments and the potential risks associated with TikTok's operations in the U.S. introduce some uncertainties.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
