A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant investment by Apple ($725 billion) that has led to a surge in earnings per share, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. The emphasis on non-tech-based investments suggests diversification, potentially mitigating risks associated with market volatility in the tech sector. Given this positive earnings report and substantial investment backing, the likelihood of the stock price rising is high. Conversely, the lack of direct connection to AI, which is a hot topic in tech, might not appeal to all investors, but the overall sentiment remains bullish.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights a general expectation of continued market growth in 2025, driven partly by anticipated business-friendly policies. Specifically for Apple, Rosenblatt Securities maintains a 'Buy' rating with a $262 price target. The company's focus on AI (Apple Intelligence) and services revenue shows proactive adaptation and is viewed positively by Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy, expecting meaningful growth. However, the article also acknowledges potential risks like uncertainty around Trump's policies and the possibility of market corrections. There's a mention of slower iPhone sales due to Chinese competition. Moreover, the article positions Apple lower than other AI stocks in terms of potential returns. Considering these factors, the outlook is slightly more positive than negative but far from a guaranteed rise because AI stocks show more promise for other companies. The potential market volatility also contributes to uncertainty. A 0.55 probability of rise reflects this cautiously optimistic view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with concerns about slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China (a key market), suggests a negative outlook for the company's short-term performance.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further support this. While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive surprises, the analyst's concerns about increasing competition and a lack of compelling AI features are significant headwinds.  The fact that the stock dipped immediately after the news release demonstrates an immediate negative market reaction.  However, Apple is a large, well-established company, and the probability of a significant, sustained fall might be limited. A slight rise is possible if the earnings report surpasses expectations, but the negative pre-earnings sentiment is substantial.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on ASML's positive earnings and the CEO's optimistic outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips, which are used in Apple's products. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities, likely resulting in a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, so the probability is moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses ASML's positive earnings report and its CEO's optimistic view on AI chip demand, which could have a positive impact on companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that rely on these chips. However, the article is primarily about ASML and its direct impact, not AAPL. The CEO of ASML dismissed concerns that a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek would hurt demand for AI chips, which could benefit AAPL as a major tech company using these chips. Given that the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than AAPL specifically, the impact on AAPL's stock price might be indirect. However, as a major customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's machines, AAPL could see a positive impact from increased demand for AI chips.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article mentions a collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong fiscal fourth quarter earnings could have a positive impact on the tech industry as a whole. However, the antitrust concerns regarding HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks may have a negative impact on the overall market sentiment. Given that the news about Apple is positive and there is no negative news about the company, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025. Despite his criteria focusing on quality companies with strong dividend yields, Apple meets these criteria well given its historical financial performance, stable balance sheet, and ongoing service offerings. Additionally, Apple's strong revenue performance, recent product releases such as the iPhone 16, and AI strategy provide a positive outlook. However, the volatility noted by Madison Investments and the potential risks associated with TikTok's operations in the U.S. introduce some uncertainties.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant $725 billion investment that is contributing to Apple's growth, coupled with a surge in earnings per share (EPS). This suggests a strong financial position and positive sentiment regarding Apple's performance. While the emphasis on non-tech-based investment might not excite all investors, the overall impact appears bullish due to the substantial EPS increase and potential for diversified growth. Previous mixed predictions show a spectrum of optimism, with some emphasizing concerns over competition and market volatility. However, the strong headline and growth indicators lead to a higher probability of a stock price rise despite underlying risks. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's (AAPL) prospects for 2025. Several factors contribute to a potentially positive outlook: Wall Street predicts general market growth, Rosenblatt Securities reiterates a 'Buy' rating with a $262 price target, the integration of Apple Intelligence, and investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and the iPhone 16 launch. Concerns include potential negative impacts from Trump's policy uncertainty, warnings of market corrections, and slower iPhone sales due to Chinese competition. Further, while deemed a solid stock, the article indicates more bullish sentiment exists around AI-focused stocks. The previous predictions have varied significantly, with some being quite bullish while some are bearish, reflecting the uncertainty. Taking all into consideration, I am estimating the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly greater than falling, though not massively, given the existing headwinds and divided predictions from previous turns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with specific data points like a 25% decline in iPhone shipments to China in Q4 2024 and concerns about slowing iPhone replacement cycles and lackluster AI offerings, paints a bearish picture.  While the upcoming earnings report could offer a positive surprise (and this uncertainty is factored into the probabilities), the pre-earnings sentiment is heavily negative, as reflected in the immediate dip in share price.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models seeing potential for a rise based on unrelated positive news in other tech sectors or Apple's overall strength. However, the current news directly impacts Apple and outweighs those more distant positive factors.  I've adjusted my probabilities based on the severity of the presented negative news and the consensus of several model predictions indicating a higher likelihood of a price drop than a rise.  While a large, established company like Apple is less likely to experience a dramatic fall, the current situation suggests a fall is more probable than a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on ASML's positive earnings and the CEO's optimistic outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips, which are used in Apple's products. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities, likely resulting in a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, so the probability is moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses ASML's positive earnings report and its CEO's optimistic view on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, using ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips used in Apple's products, potentially increasing confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, and the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than AAPL specifically. Given this indirect positive impact, there is a moderate to high probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a positive development for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with its collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong fiscal fourth quarter earnings could have a positive impact on the tech industry as a whole. Although there are antitrust concerns regarding HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks, this news does not directly impact Apple. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general trend of cautious optimism about Apple's stock price movement. Models such as meta-llama/llama-4-scout and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct have predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising, while models like google/gemini-flash-1.5 have predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the news provided does not indicate any significant negative developments for Apple, and the company's collaboration with SpaceX could lead to increased consumer interest and demand for its products. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025. Given his criteria, Apple meets the requirements of being a stable, financially strong company with a history of consistent dividend payments. Recent positive developments include a strong revenue performance, product releases, and its AI strategy. However, there are some uncertainties, such as the potential risks associated with TikTok's operations in the U.S. and volatility noted by Madison Investments. The mixed set of sentiments provided by different models suggests a balanced outlook, leaning towards a positive outlook due to O'Leary's endorsement and recent achievements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
