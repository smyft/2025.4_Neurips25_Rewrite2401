(AAPL)\nNews Headline: ASML stock rises after earnings beat as CEO says DeepSeek will drive AI chip demand higher\nNews Content: ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on January 29, 2025.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant investment by Apple ($725 billion) that has led to a surge in earnings per share, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. The emphasis on non-tech-based investments suggests diversification, potentially mitigating risks associated with market volatility in the tech sector. Given this positive earnings report and substantial investment backing, the likelihood of the stock price rising is high. Conversely, the lack of direct connection to AI, which is a hot topic in tech, might not appeal to all investors, but the overall sentiment remains bullish.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights a general expectation of continued market growth in 2025, driven partly by anticipated business-friendly policies. Specifically for Apple, Rosenblatt Securities maintains a 'Buy' rating with a $262 price target. The company's focus on AI (Apple Intelligence) and services revenue shows proactive adaptation and is viewed positively by Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy, expecting meaningful growth. However, the article also acknowledges potential risks like uncertainty around Trump's policies and the possibility of market corrections. There's a mention of slower iPhone sales due to Chinese competition. Moreover, the article positions Apple lower than other AI stocks in terms of potential returns. Considering these factors, the outlook is slightly more positive than negative but far from a guaranteed rise because AI stocks show more promise for other companies. The potential market volatility also contributes to uncertainty. A 0.55 probability of rise reflects this cautiously optimistic view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with concerns about slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China (a key market), suggests a negative outlook for the company's short-term performance.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further support this. While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive surprises, the analyst's concerns about increasing competition and a lack of compelling AI features are significant headwinds.  The fact that the stock dipped immediately after the news release demonstrates an immediate negative market reaction.  However, Apple is a large, well-established company, and the probability of a significant, sustained fall might be limited. A slight rise is possible if the earnings report surpasses expectations, but the negative pre-earnings sentiment is substantial.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on ASML's positive earnings and the CEO's optimistic outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips, which are used in Apple's products. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities, likely resulting in a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, so the probability is moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses ASML's positive earnings report and its CEO's optimistic view on AI chip demand, which could have a positive impact on companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that rely on these chips. However, the article is primarily about ASML and its direct impact, not AAPL. The CEO of ASML dismissed concerns that a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek would hurt demand for AI chips, which could benefit AAPL as a major tech company using these chips. Given that the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than AAPL specifically, the impact on AAPL's stock price might be indirect. However, as a major customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's machines, AAPL could see a positive impact from increased demand for AI chips.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article mentions a collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong fiscal fourth quarter earnings could have a positive impact on the tech industry as a whole. However, the antitrust concerns regarding HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks may have a negative impact on the overall market sentiment. Given that the news about Apple is positive and there is no negative news about the company, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025. Despite his criteria focusing on quality companies with strong dividend yields, Apple meets these criteria well given its historical financial performance, stable balance sheet, and ongoing service offerings. Additionally, Apple's strong revenue performance, recent product releases such as the iPhone 16, and AI strategy provide a positive outlook. However, the volatility noted by Madison Investments and the potential risks associated with TikTok's operations in the U.S. introduce some uncertainties.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant $725 billion investment that is contributing to Apple's growth, coupled with a surge in earnings per share (EPS). This suggests a strong financial position and positive sentiment regarding Apple's performance. While the emphasis on non-tech-based investment might not excite all investors, the overall impact appears bullish due to the substantial EPS increase and potential for diversified growth. Previous mixed predictions show a spectrum of optimism, with some emphasizing concerns over competition and market volatility. However, the strong headline and growth indicators lead to a higher probability of a stock price rise despite underlying risks. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's (AAPL) prospects for 2025. Several factors contribute to a potentially positive outlook: Wall Street predicts general market growth, Rosenblatt Securities reiterates a 'Buy' rating with a $262 price target, the integration of Apple Intelligence, and investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and the iPhone 16 launch. Concerns include potential negative impacts from Trump's policy uncertainty, warnings of market corrections, and slower iPhone sales due to Chinese competition. Further, while deemed a solid stock, the article indicates more bullish sentiment exists around AI-focused stocks. The previous predictions have varied significantly, with some being quite bullish while some are bearish, reflecting the uncertainty. Taking all into consideration, I am estimating the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly greater than falling, though not massively, given the existing headwinds and divided predictions from previous turns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with specific data points like a 25% decline in iPhone shipments to China in Q4 2024 and concerns about slowing iPhone replacement cycles and lackluster AI offerings, paints a bearish picture.  While the upcoming earnings report could offer a positive surprise (and this uncertainty is factored into the probabilities), the pre-earnings sentiment is heavily negative, as reflected in the immediate dip in share price.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models seeing potential for a rise based on unrelated positive news in other tech sectors or Apple's overall strength. However, the current news directly impacts Apple and outweighs those more distant positive factors.  I've adjusted my probabilities based on the severity of the presented negative news and the consensus of several model predictions indicating a higher likelihood of a price drop than a rise.  While a large, established company like Apple is less likely to experience a dramatic fall, the current situation suggests a fall is more probable than a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on ASML's positive earnings and the CEO's optimistic outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips, which are used in Apple's products. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities, likely resulting in a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, so the probability is moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses ASML's positive earnings report and its CEO's optimistic view on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, using ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips used in Apple's products, potentially increasing confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, and the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than AAPL specifically. Given this indirect positive impact, there is a moderate to high probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a positive development for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with its collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong fiscal fourth quarter earnings could have a positive impact on the tech industry as a whole. Although there are antitrust concerns regarding HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks, this news does not directly impact Apple. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general trend of cautious optimism about Apple's stock price movement. Models such as meta-llama/llama-4-scout and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct have predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising, while models like google/gemini-flash-1.5 have predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the news provided does not indicate any significant negative developments for Apple, and the company's collaboration with SpaceX could lead to increased consumer interest and demand for its products. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025. Given his criteria, Apple meets the requirements of being a stable, financially strong company with a history of consistent dividend payments. Recent positive developments include a strong revenue performance, product releases, and its AI strategy. However, there are some uncertainties, such as the potential risks associated with TikTok's operations in the U.S. and volatility noted by Madison Investments. The mixed set of sentiments provided by different models suggests a balanced outlook, leaning towards a positive outlook due to O'Leary's endorsement and recent achievements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's substantial $725 billion investment has positively impacted its earnings per share (EPS), suggesting a strong financial position and growth potential. While some analysts express concerns about competition and market volatility, the emphasis on a significant investment driving growth is generally perceived positively. The mixed predictions from previous rounds, while they show some bearish sentiment, don't outweigh the bullish implications of the investment and EPS increase. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise based on the positive indicators present in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock. Several factors contribute to this: the anticipation of continued market growth in 2025, a \"Buy\" rating from Rosenblatt Securities with a $262 price target, Apple's focus on integrating AI, and investor enthusiasm for the iPhone 16 launch. Potential risks include uncertainties surrounding Trump's policies and potential market corrections. Concerns also exist regarding slower iPhone sales due to Chinese competition. While regarded as a solid stock especially as a result of its revenue stability, the article highlights greater bullish sentiment toward other AI stocks. The earlier predictions varied widely, reflecting market uncertainty. Given these considerations, my estimate is a balanced one, nudging only slightly toward a possibility of stock price rise, to account for revenue performance and AI integration, but not discounting headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple, focusing on slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling AI applications.  Oppenheimer's downgrade to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, reinforces this negative sentiment.  While the upcoming earnings report could offer a potential upside, the immediate market reaction (a dip in share price) and the severity of the reported concerns suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the weight of the negative news in this specific article outweighs the more tangential positive news mentioned in previous rounds (e.g., positive news about ASML or other tech companies).  The probability of a rise is not zero;  a significant earnings beat could reverse the negative sentiment, but given the current information, a fall is more likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses ASML's positive earnings and the CEO's optimistic outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips, which are used in Apple's products. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities, likely resulting in a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, and the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than AAPL specifically. Given this indirect positive impact, there is a moderate to high probability of Apple's stock price rising. The previous predictions from various models also show a trend of cautious optimism, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The provided news headline focuses on ASML's stock rise after earnings beat and its CEO's optimistic view on AI chip demand. While the news is primarily about ASML, it indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology for producing advanced chips. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for chips used in Apple's products, potentially increasing confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities. However, the direct connection is tangential, and the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry than AAPL specifically. Given this indirect positive impact and considering previous predictions from various models, there is a moderate to high probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights a collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong fiscal fourth quarter earnings could have a positive impact on the tech industry as a whole.

Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general trend of cautious optimism about Apple's stock price movement. The news provided does not indicate any significant negative developments for Apple, and the company's collaboration with SpaceX could lead to increased consumer interest and demand for its products. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025.

However, there are some uncertainties, such as the potential risks associated with TikTok's operations in the U.S. and volatility noted by Madison Investments. The mixed set of sentiments provided by different models suggests a balanced outlook, leaning towards a positive outlook due to O'Leary's endorsement and recent achievements.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news about Apple's substantial $725 billion investment leading to a surge in earnings per share (EPS) suggests a strong positive financial outlook for the company. This is a significant factor that generally increases investor confidence and expectations for the stock price to rise. Although analysts have expressed some concerns regarding competition and the overall tech market volatility, the positive implications of the investment and EPS growth appear to outweigh the negatives. Given the diverse predictions from previous rounds, there is still a general trend leaning towards optimism regarding Apple's potential stock price movement. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article paints a mixed picture of Apple's prospects as a 'buy and hold' stock for 2025. While the overall market is expected to continue growing, the pace is projected to be slower than in previous years. A key positive is the anticipation of business-friendly policies under a Trump administration, which could particularly benefit tech stocks, including Apple. Dan Ives' prediction of a 25% rise in tech stocks is optimistic. Apple's focus on AI (Apple Intelligence) and ongoing strong performance in its services revenue indicates that the company is proactively adapting to market trends, and investor enthusiasm exists for its AI roadmap and the iPhone 16. Rosenblatt's 'Buy' rating with a $262 target adds further positive support. However, the article also highlights significant risks, including uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and potential market volatility due to proposed tariffs. Concerns also remain about slowing iPhone sales and increased competition from Chinese manufacturers, which could temper revenue growth. Jurrien Timmer's caution about potential market corrections and the impact of rising interest rates adds further uncertainty. The article's conclusion that AI stocks hold greater potential for short-term returns points to Apple potentially underperforming some of its peers. The most recent Rosenblatt Securities reiteration of their 'Buy' rating with a price target of $262, adds to the likelihood of the price going up. Furthermore, many previous models also predicted a higher probability of the stock price increasing. The probability of a stock price increase as a result of the article is increased.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with significant declines in Chinese iPhone shipments and concerns about slowing replacement cycles and the lack of compelling AI features, presents a bearish outlook.  While the upcoming earnings report could offer a positive surprise, the immediate negative market reaction and the weight of the negative news outweigh the more positive assessments in previous prediction rounds that focused on unrelated factors.  Many models across several rounds reflect a greater probability of a price drop than a rise. However, Apple is a large, established company; a significant fall is less likely than a moderate one.  Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher, but the probability of a rise isn't zero due to potential earnings surprises.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses ASML's positive earnings and the CEO's optimistic outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's technology. The positive performance and guidance from ASML suggest strong underlying demand for advanced chips, which are used in Apple's products. This could lead to increased confidence in Apple's supply chain and future product capabilities, likely resulting in a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct connection is somewhat tangential, and the news is more directly related to ASML and the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than AAPL specifically.
