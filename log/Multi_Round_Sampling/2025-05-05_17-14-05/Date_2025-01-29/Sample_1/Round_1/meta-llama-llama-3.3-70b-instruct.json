A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI and its ability to provide competitive AI solutions at lower costs raises concerns for US tech companies, including Apple. While the news highlights potential advancements in AI modeling, it also underscores geopolitical and national security risks, which could prompt caution among investors. The negative implications of heightened competition and security concerns may overshadow any potential market benefits mentioned by industry experts, leading to a higher probability of negative sentiment affecting Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the massive share buyback program has significantly boosted EPS and signals management confidence, slowing product sales and a historically high P/E ratio introduce concerns. Warren Buffett's reduced stake further raises a red flag. The article also highlights Apple's investment in AI. Overall, the positive effects of the buyback program are potentially offset by valuation concerns and slowing product sales, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The double down recommendation may only be a tactic to get more views to help promote The Motley Fool. The recommendation also does not have sufficient supporting data or reasoning.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the group is positive, with expected earnings growth, Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is negative (-1.51%), and its Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), suggesting a higher probability of the stock underperforming expectations.  The article highlights weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications.  While Apple enjoys a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell ranking outweigh the historical performance in this context. The recent Jefferies downgrade further contributes to the bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be higher than a price rise in the short term following the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders). However, there are risks: 1) Slower iPhone sales in the short term due to competition from Chinese manufacturers. 2) Market volatility from potential policy changes (e.g., tariffs) and mean reversion risks highlighted by analysts. Overall, the positive catalysts (AI, services growth, bullish tech sector) outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the company's stock. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst outlooks can lead to decreased investor confidence and subsequently lower stock prices. Additionally, the concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, suggest potential revenue challenges for Apple. Given that the stock has already fallen 9% from its December record and considering the overall negative sentiment, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. This integration is now supported in the latest iOS 18.3 update, which could lead to increased adoption and revenue for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have a indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership. However, the news also mentions antitrust concerns related to HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks, which may not have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Overall, the positive developments related to Apple's Starlink integration and T-Mobile's earnings report are likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
