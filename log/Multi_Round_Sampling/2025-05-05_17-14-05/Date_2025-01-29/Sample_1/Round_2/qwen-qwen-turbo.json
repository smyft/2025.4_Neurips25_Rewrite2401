      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI and its ability to provide competitive AI solutions at lower costs raises concerns for US tech companies, including Apple. While the news highlights potential advancements in AI modeling, it also underscores geopolitical and national security risks, which could prompt caution among investors. The negative implications of heightened competition and security concerns may overshadow any potential market benefits mentioned by industry experts, leading to a higher probability of negative sentiment affecting Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the massive share buyback program has significantly boosted EPS and signals management confidence, slowing product sales and a historically high P/E ratio introduce concerns. Warren Buffett's reduced stake further raises a red flag. The article also highlights Apple's investment in AI. Overall, the positive effects of the buyback program are potentially offset by valuation concerns and slowing product sales, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The double down recommendation may only be a tactic to get more views to help promote The Motley Fool. The recommendation also does not have sufficient supporting data or reasoning.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the group is positive, with expected earnings growth, Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is negative (-1.51%), and its Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), suggesting a higher probability of the stock underperforming expectations.  The article highlights weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications.  While Apple enjoys a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell ranking outweigh the historical performance in this context. The recent Jefferies downgrade further contributes to the bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be higher than a price rise in the short term following the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders). However, there are risks: 1) Slower iPhone sales in the short term due to competition from Chinese manufacturers. 2) Market volatility from potential policy changes (e.g., tariffs) and mean reversion risks highlighted by analysts. Overall, the positive catalysts (AI, services growth, bullish tech sector) outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the company's stock. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst outlooks can lead to decreased investor confidence and subsequently lower stock prices. Additionally, the concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, suggest potential revenue challenges for Apple. Given that the stock has already fallen 9% from its December record and considering the overall negative sentiment, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. This integration is now supported in the latest iOS 18.3 update, which could lead to increased adoption and revenue for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have a indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership. However, the news also mentions antitrust concerns related to HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks, which may not have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Overall, the positive developments related to Apple's Starlink integration and T-Mobile's earnings report are likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI, which poses competitive threats to US tech companies, particularly in the rapidly evolving AI space, raises significant concerns for Apple and others. This geopolitical context introduces uncertainty, as national security implications could affect investor confidence. While there are positive catalysts for Apple, such as advancements in AI and potential growth opportunities, the overall sentiment from the news is cautious. The previous predictions indicate a higher likelihood of bearish sentiment driven by heightened competition and security concerns, overshadowing any optimistic factors. Therefore, the probabilities suggest a greater chance of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This article presents a mixed view of Apple. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock repurchase program and the resulting boost to EPS, signaling strong management confidence. It also mentions Apple's investments in AI through Apple Intelligence. However, there are significant negatives, including slowing sales of physical products, an historically high P/E ratio, and Warren Buffett's reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake. The article emphasizes the stagnation of Apple's physical product sales, raising concerns about long-term growth. While the buyback program inflates EPS, the underlying issue of product stagnation and high valuation warrant caution. Taking everything into consideration, I tilt toward the falling prediction. However, the 'double down' advertisement creates a mixed signal, given the advertisement may not reflect the actual reality.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of several tech giants, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the 'Magnificent 7' is positive, Apple's outlook presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest a higher probability of underperforming expectations. Weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications further contribute to a bearish outlook. Although Apple has a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell rating outweigh this historical performance in this context. The Jefferies downgrade adds weight to the negative sentiment.  However, the overall market sentiment towards tech and the possibility of a positive earnings surprise should not be entirely discounted. Considering the various factors and the range of predictions from previous models, a moderate probability of a price fall is estimated.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders).

Given that the stock has already fallen 9% from its December record and considering the overall negative sentiment, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term. However, the emergence of positive news or developments could potentially mitigate this negative trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company.

Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have an indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership. Considering the previous predictions, some models have a bearish outlook due to concerns such as slowing iPhone sales, valuation concerns, and antitrust issues, while others are bullish due to positive catalysts like AI integration and services growth. However, the current news focuses on a specific positive development for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise. Given the mixed but generally positive tone of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment. Previous predictions from different models show a mix of bearish and bullish sentiments. Considering the broad market recovery, positive momentum from the tech sector, and the fact that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' with a strong record of earnings, there is a reasonable expectation that the market might favor Apple\u2019s earnings positively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
