(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings: Tesla, Microsoft &amp; Meta in Focus\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have soared on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close today. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFourth-quarter earnings of the Mag 7 companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the past three months.\n\nTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nTesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Musk's proximity to Trump's administration during its second term. Trump's administration could help expedite regulatory approval for new versions of Tesla's self-driving software and for its autonomous \"robotaxis\" to hit the road.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit when the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump recently rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on TSLA shares. Tesla shares fell 5% in a month. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3. This software maker has witnessed a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Microsoft\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 4.91%, on average, in the last four quarters. The company is expected to post substantial earnings growth of 6.5% and revenue growth of 10.8% in the to-be-reported quarter. Microsoft has gained about 3.5% over the past three months.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, courtesy of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and its investments in data centers and Copilot AI applications. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\n\nIn the latest development, Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on constructing data centers designed for artificial intelligence workloads. Over half of this spending will be focused on the United States, according to a blog post by Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president.\r\n\r\nThough Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the coming quarters. Microsoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 14% over the past three months.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from $680 to $700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to $710 from $660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has gained about 4% over the past three months.\n\nApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has gained 12% in the last three months.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.5% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 23.6% in the past three months.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon recently soared to new all-time highs, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI and its ability to provide competitive AI solutions at lower costs raises concerns for US tech companies, including Apple. While the news highlights potential advancements in AI modeling, it also underscores geopolitical and national security risks, which could prompt caution among investors. The negative implications of heightened competition and security concerns may overshadow any potential market benefits mentioned by industry experts, leading to a higher probability of negative sentiment affecting Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the massive share buyback program has significantly boosted EPS and signals management confidence, slowing product sales and a historically high P/E ratio introduce concerns. Warren Buffett's reduced stake further raises a red flag. The article also highlights Apple's investment in AI. Overall, the positive effects of the buyback program are potentially offset by valuation concerns and slowing product sales, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The double down recommendation may only be a tactic to get more views to help promote The Motley Fool. The recommendation also does not have sufficient supporting data or reasoning.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the group is positive, with expected earnings growth, Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is negative (-1.51%), and its Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), suggesting a higher probability of the stock underperforming expectations.  The article highlights weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications.  While Apple enjoys a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell ranking outweigh the historical performance in this context. The recent Jefferies downgrade further contributes to the bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be higher than a price rise in the short term following the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders). However, there are risks: 1) Slower iPhone sales in the short term due to competition from Chinese manufacturers. 2) Market volatility from potential policy changes (e.g., tariffs) and mean reversion risks highlighted by analysts. Overall, the positive catalysts (AI, services growth, bullish tech sector) outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the company's stock. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst outlooks can lead to decreased investor confidence and subsequently lower stock prices. Additionally, the concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, suggest potential revenue challenges for Apple. Given that the stock has already fallen 9% from its December record and considering the overall negative sentiment, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. This integration is now supported in the latest iOS 18.3 update, which could lead to increased adoption and revenue for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have a indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership. However, the news also mentions antitrust concerns related to HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks, which may not have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Overall, the positive developments related to Apple's Starlink integration and T-Mobile's earnings report are likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI, which poses competitive threats to US tech companies, particularly in the rapidly evolving AI space, raises significant concerns for Apple and others. This geopolitical context introduces uncertainty, as national security implications could affect investor confidence. While there are positive catalysts for Apple, such as advancements in AI and potential growth opportunities, the overall sentiment from the news is cautious. The previous predictions indicate a higher likelihood of bearish sentiment driven by heightened competition and security concerns, overshadowing any optimistic factors. Therefore, the probabilities suggest a greater chance of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This article presents a mixed view of Apple. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock repurchase program and the resulting boost to EPS, signaling strong management confidence. It also mentions Apple's investments in AI through Apple Intelligence. However, there are significant negatives, including slowing sales of physical products, an historically high P/E ratio, and Warren Buffett's reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake. The article emphasizes the stagnation of Apple's physical product sales, raising concerns about long-term growth. While the buyback program inflates EPS, the underlying issue of product stagnation and high valuation warrant caution. Taking everything into consideration, I tilt toward the falling prediction. However, the 'double down' advertisement creates a mixed signal, given the advertisement may not reflect the actual reality.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of several tech giants, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the 'Magnificent 7' is positive, Apple's outlook presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest a higher probability of underperforming expectations. Weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications further contribute to a bearish outlook. Although Apple has a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell rating outweigh this historical performance in this context. The Jefferies downgrade adds weight to the negative sentiment.  However, the overall market sentiment towards tech and the possibility of a positive earnings surprise should not be entirely discounted. Considering the various factors and the range of predictions from previous models, a moderate probability of a price fall is estimated.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders).

Considering the previous predictions, some models have a bearish outlook due to concerns such as slowing iPhone sales, valuation concerns, and antitrust issues, while others are bullish due to positive catalysts like AI integration and services growth. However, the current news focuses on a specific positive development for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise. Given the mixed but generally positive tone of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment. Previous predictions from different models show a mix of bearish and bullish sentiments. Considering the broad market recovery, positive momentum from the tech sector, and the fact that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' with a strong record of earnings, there is a reasonable expectation that the market might favor Apple\u2019s earnings positively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
