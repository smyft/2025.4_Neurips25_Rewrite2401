(AAPL) the Best American Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nWill the Market Continue To Be Bullish in 2025?\n\nWall Street\u2019s outlook for the stock market in 2025 reflects a cautious optimism following two consecutive years of substantial gains. Analysts predict continued growth, however at a more moderate pace compared to the explosive increases of 2023 and 2024. According to a report by CNN, published on January 1, strategists anticipate a 14.8% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, which is significant but lower than the previous years\u2019 performances. The Index saw gains of approximately 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. As per the report 2025 marks a return to typical growth rates after an extraordinary period of high returns, which has not been seen since the late 1990s.\n\nWhile several factors are expected to contribute to the market growth, there are potential risks that can hinder it. One of the key factors contributing to growth is the anticipated business-friendly policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Dan Ives, who is a technology senior analyst at Wedbush Securities in his December 30 note mentioned his expectations that tech stocks can rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration. The analyst has picked Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks as his best performers for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential risks that could negatively impact the stock market. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy decisions may create a volatile environment for markets. Traders are particularly wary of how proposed tariffs could affect economic stability and investor confidence. David Sekera from Morningstar emphasizes that the implementation of tariffs is a significant wildcard that could sway market performance in either direction. We recently covered the analysis of Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company in our article titled, 12 High Growth International Stocks to Invest in Now. Here\u2019s a piece from our coverage:\n\n\u201cWhile talking about large-cap stock performance, Timmer raises the question of whether this trend of narrow leadership will persist. He suggested that trends continue to move in the same direction until a significant change occurs. Given that large-cap growth stocks have dominated for years, it is reasonable to assume that they may continue to lead. However, he also cautioned the investors that as per the concept of mean reversion, asset prices will eventually return to their historical averages and when this happens, it could lead to sharp corrections in stock prices. Timmer believes that while 2024 was a \u201cGoldilocks year,\u201d for earnings and valuations, this year can be a tussle between higher earnings and rising long-term interest rates, thereby resulting in a volatile market.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo get the list of the 10 best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. Using the database we ranked the top 10 American stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an international provider of smartphones, personal computers, and other technology gadgets. Based in America, the company is renowned for its iPhone, Mac, and iPad. On January 27, Rosenblatt Securities reiterated their Buy rating on the stock, keeping the price target of $262. The firm expects the ongoing December quarter to be a bit low due to slower sales of the iPhone as it continues to face challenges from other Chinese manufacturers.\n\nManagement has been proactive in dealing with this competition. They released Apple Intelligence in June last year. The new artificial intelligence will be integrated with upcoming models to enhance user experience and act as a competitive edge over its competitors. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also shifted its focus on the Apple Store and its services revenue stream. As a result, the company was able to generate a record $25 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of 2024, indicating a 12% increase year-over-year.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here\u2019s what it is said regarding the company in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI and its ability to provide competitive AI solutions at lower costs raises concerns for US tech companies, including Apple. While the news highlights potential advancements in AI modeling, it also underscores geopolitical and national security risks, which could prompt caution among investors. The negative implications of heightened competition and security concerns may overshadow any potential market benefits mentioned by industry experts, leading to a higher probability of negative sentiment affecting Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the massive share buyback program has significantly boosted EPS and signals management confidence, slowing product sales and a historically high P/E ratio introduce concerns. Warren Buffett's reduced stake further raises a red flag. The article also highlights Apple's investment in AI. Overall, the positive effects of the buyback program are potentially offset by valuation concerns and slowing product sales, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The double down recommendation may only be a tactic to get more views to help promote The Motley Fool. The recommendation also does not have sufficient supporting data or reasoning.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the group is positive, with expected earnings growth, Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is negative (-1.51%), and its Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), suggesting a higher probability of the stock underperforming expectations.  The article highlights weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications.  While Apple enjoys a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell ranking outweigh the historical performance in this context. The recent Jefferies downgrade further contributes to the bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be higher than a price rise in the short term following the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders). However, there are risks: 1) Slower iPhone sales in the short term due to competition from Chinese manufacturers. 2) Market volatility from potential policy changes (e.g., tariffs) and mean reversion risks highlighted by analysts. Overall, the positive catalysts (AI, services growth, bullish tech sector) outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the company's stock. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst outlooks can lead to decreased investor confidence and subsequently lower stock prices. Additionally, the concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, suggest potential revenue challenges for Apple. Given that the stock has already fallen 9% from its December record and considering the overall negative sentiment, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. This integration is now supported in the latest iOS 18.3 update, which could lead to increased adoption and revenue for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have a indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership. However, the news also mentions antitrust concerns related to HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks, which may not have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Overall, the positive developments related to Apple's Starlink integration and T-Mobile's earnings report are likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI, which poses competitive threats to US tech companies, particularly in the rapidly evolving AI space, raises significant concerns for Apple and others. This geopolitical context introduces uncertainty, as national security implications could affect investor confidence. While there are positive catalysts for Apple, such as advancements in AI and potential growth opportunities, the overall sentiment from the news is cautious. The previous predictions indicate a higher likelihood of bearish sentiment driven by heightened competition and security concerns, overshadowing any optimistic factors. Therefore, the probabilities suggest a greater chance of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This article presents a mixed view of Apple. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock repurchase program and the resulting boost to EPS, signaling strong management confidence. It also mentions Apple's investments in AI through Apple Intelligence. However, there are significant negatives, including slowing sales of physical products, an historically high P/E ratio, and Warren Buffett's reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake. The article emphasizes the stagnation of Apple's physical product sales, raising concerns about long-term growth. While the buyback program inflates EPS, the underlying issue of product stagnation and high valuation warrant caution. Taking everything into consideration, I tilt toward the falling prediction. However, the 'double down' advertisement creates a mixed signal, given the advertisement may not reflect the actual reality.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of several tech giants, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the 'Magnificent 7' is positive, Apple's outlook presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest a higher probability of underperforming expectations. Weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications further contribute to a bearish outlook. Although Apple has a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell rating outweigh this historical performance in this context. The Jefferies downgrade adds weight to the negative sentiment.  However, the overall market sentiment towards tech and the possibility of a positive earnings surprise should not be entirely discounted. Considering the various factors and the range of predictions from previous models, a moderate probability of a price fall is estimated.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders).

Given that the stock has already fallen 9% from its December record and considering the overall negative sentiment, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term. However, the emergence of positive news or developments could potentially mitigate this negative trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company.

Considering the previous predictions, some models have a bearish outlook due to concerns such as slowing iPhone sales, valuation concerns, and antitrust issues, while others are bullish due to positive catalysts like AI integration and services growth. However, the current news focuses on a specific positive development for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise. Given the mixed but generally positive tone of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment. Previous predictions from different models show a mix of bearish and bullish sentiments. Considering the broad market recovery, positive momentum from the tech sector, and the fact that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' with a strong record of earnings, there is a reasonable expectation that the market might favor Apple\u2019s earnings positively.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of China's DeepSeek AI has raised concerns among investors about increased competition and potential national security implications for U.S. tech companies, including Apple. While some models suggest cautious optimism due to Apple's strong market position and focus on AI, the overall sentiment expressed in the news emphasizes risks associated with geopolitical tensions and competitive threats. This context leads to a more bearish outlook for Apple's stock in the short term, overshadowing any positive catalysts. The predictions from various sources primarily lean towards an expectation of a decline in stock price, thus influencing my estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. While the stock buyback program is a positive factor, the slowing sales of physical products, high P/E ratio, and Buffett's reduced stake are significant concerns. The 'double down' advertisement may mislead readers. Considering the existing predictions from other models, the negative factors outweigh the positive factors slightly, suggesting the stock price is more likely to fall. The trend in previous predictions are mixed. Some models suggest the stock may fall, while other models suggest it may raise up in stock price. However, according to the current data analysis, the stock would more likely fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show modest growth, several factors point towards a higher probability of a price fall. Apple's negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) are significant bearish indicators. Weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications add to the negative sentiment.  The Jefferies downgrade further reinforces this outlook. While Apple historically delivers positive earnings surprises and benefits from being part of the 'Magnificent 7,' the current specific indicators outweigh the general positive tech sector sentiment. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, but a majority lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.  Considering the relatively weak internal factors juxtaposed to the overall positive tech sector sentiment, a slightly bearish outlook is warranted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. On the positive side, Apple's strong position in the technology sector, focus on AI integration (Apple Intelligence), and upcoming iPhone 16 launch are seen as growth drivers. Analysts like Dan Ives predict a 25% rise in tech stocks due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration, and Apple's services revenue showed a 12% YoY increase in Q4 2024. Additionally, hedge fund confidence is notable with 158 holders. However, there are significant risks: slower iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese manufacturers, market volatility from potential policy changes (e.g., tariffs), and mean reversion risks highlighted by analysts. The previous predictions show a divergence, with some models leaning bearish due to competition and valuation concerns, while others are bullish based on AI and services growth. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts appear slightly more compelling, but the risks are substantial enough to warrant caution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the company's stock.

However, the emergence of positive news or developments could potentially mitigate this negative trend. The mixed predictions from previous models also reflect the uncertainty in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. This integration is now supported in the latest iOS 18.3 update, which could lead to increased adoption and revenue for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have an indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership. Considering the previous predictions, some models have a bearish outlook due to concerns such as slowing iPhone sales, valuation concerns, and antitrust issues, while others are bullish due to positive catalysts like AI integration and services growth.

While there are some positive catalysts for Apple, such as its investments in AI and a strong buyback program, the overall sentiment is overshadowed by geopolitical risks and negative analyst outlooks related to iPhone sales. This leads to a more bearish view of Apple's stock price movement in the near term, as reflected in the predictions from various models, which tend to lean towards a price fall due to heightened competition and diminishing investor confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The $725 billion buyback program has significantly boosted EPS and signals management's confidence. Apple's ongoing push for subscription services and AI investment are also positive. However, stalling physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio are concerning. Warren Buffett's reduced stake in Apple adds further negative sentiment. While the buybacks help EPS, the core issue of stagnating product sales and a premium valuation raises red flags. Previous predictions are varied, reflecting this conflicting information. Considering the mixed signals and the stagnation in major product lines, I lean slightly towards a price fall, but not drastically. Therefore, I will assign a probability slightly lower to a fall. Also, it is important to emphasize that this is not a pure AI play, so the excitement around AI may not contribute positively to Apple's prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7,' experiencing overall positive growth projections, its individual circumstances are less rosy. A negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), weak sales guidance, and limited initial impact of its AI applications point towards a higher probability of underperformance.  The Jefferies downgrade adds further bearish pressure.  While Apple has a strong history of exceeding earnings expectations and benefits from positive sector-wide sentiment, these negative factors currently outweigh the positives.  The previous predictions show significant disagreement among models, with probabilities ranging widely for both price increases and decreases. Considering the confluence of negative internal indicators and the mixed external context, a slightly bearish outlook prevails, but the uncertainty remains substantial.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
