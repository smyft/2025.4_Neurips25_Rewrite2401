A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI and its ability to provide competitive AI solutions at lower costs raises concerns for US tech companies, including Apple. While the news highlights potential advancements in AI modeling, it also underscores geopolitical and national security risks, which could prompt caution among investors. The negative implications of heightened competition and security concerns may overshadow any potential market benefits mentioned by industry experts, leading to a higher probability of negative sentiment affecting Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the massive share buyback program has significantly boosted EPS and signals management confidence, slowing product sales and a historically high P/E ratio introduce concerns. Warren Buffett's reduced stake further raises a red flag. The article also highlights Apple's investment in AI. Overall, the positive effects of the buyback program are potentially offset by valuation concerns and slowing product sales, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The double down recommendation may only be a tactic to get more views to help promote The Motley Fool. The recommendation also does not have sufficient supporting data or reasoning.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the group is positive, with expected earnings growth, Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is negative (-1.51%), and its Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), suggesting a higher probability of the stock underperforming expectations.  The article highlights weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications.  While Apple enjoys a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell ranking outweigh the historical performance in this context. The recent Jefferies downgrade further contributes to the bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be higher than a price rise in the short term following the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders). However, there are risks: 1) Slower iPhone sales in the short term due to competition from Chinese manufacturers. 2) Market volatility from potential policy changes (e.g., tariffs) and mean reversion risks highlighted by analysts. Overall, the positive catalysts (AI, services growth, bullish tech sector) outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the company's stock. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst outlooks can lead to decreased investor confidence and subsequently lower stock prices. Additionally, the concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, suggest potential revenue challenges for Apple. Given that the stock has already fallen 9% from its December record and considering the overall negative sentiment, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. This integration is now supported in the latest iOS 18.3 update, which could lead to increased adoption and revenue for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have a indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership. However, the news also mentions antitrust concerns related to HPE's bid to acquire Juniper Networks, which may not have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Overall, the positive developments related to Apple's Starlink integration and T-Mobile's earnings report are likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek AI, which poses competitive threats to US tech companies, particularly in the rapidly evolving AI space, raises significant concerns for Apple and others. This geopolitical context introduces uncertainty, as national security implications could affect investor confidence. While there are positive catalysts for Apple, such as advancements in AI and potential growth opportunities, the overall sentiment from the news is cautious. The previous predictions indicate a higher likelihood of bearish sentiment driven by heightened competition and security concerns, overshadowing any optimistic factors. Therefore, the probabilities suggest a greater chance of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This article presents a mixed view of Apple. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock repurchase program and the resulting boost to EPS, signaling strong management confidence. It also mentions Apple's investments in AI through Apple Intelligence. However, there are significant negatives, including slowing sales of physical products, an historically high P/E ratio, and Warren Buffett's reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake. The article emphasizes the stagnation of Apple's physical product sales, raising concerns about long-term growth. While the buyback program inflates EPS, the underlying issue of product stagnation and high valuation warrant caution. Taking everything into consideration, I tilt toward the falling prediction. However, the 'double down' advertisement creates a mixed signal, given the advertisement may not reflect the actual reality.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of several tech giants, including Apple. While the overall outlook for the 'Magnificent 7' is positive, Apple's outlook presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest a higher probability of underperforming expectations. Weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications further contribute to a bearish outlook. Although Apple has a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the negative ESP and sell rating outweigh this historical performance in this context. The Jefferies downgrade adds weight to the negative sentiment.  However, the overall market sentiment towards tech and the possibility of a positive earnings surprise should not be entirely discounted. Considering the various factors and the range of predictions from previous models, a moderate probability of a price fall is estimated.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. Key positive factors include: 1) Apple's strong position in the technology sector, with a focus on AI integration (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, which could drive growth. 2) A bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025, with analysts like Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration. 3) Strong services revenue growth (12% YoY in Q4 2024) and hedge fund confidence (158 holders).

Overall, the positive catalysts (AI, services growth, bullish tech sector) outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the company's stock.

Additionally, the concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, suggest potential revenue challenges for Apple. Given that the stock has already fallen 9% from its December record and considering the overall negative sentiment, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term. However, the emergence of positive news or developments could potentially mitigate this negative trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. This integration is now supported in the latest iOS 18.3 update, which could lead to increased adoption and revenue for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have an indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership. Considering the previous predictions, some models have a bearish outlook due to concerns such as slowing iPhone sales, valuation concerns, and antitrust issues, while others are bullish due to positive catalysts like AI integration and services growth. However, the current news focuses on a specific positive development for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise. Given the mixed but generally positive tone of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment. Previous predictions from different models show a mix of bearish and bullish sentiments. Considering the broad market recovery, positive momentum from the tech sector, and the fact that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' with a strong record of earnings, there is a reasonable expectation that the market might favor Apple\u2019s earnings positively.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of China's DeepSeek AI has raised concerns among investors about increased competition and potential national security implications for U.S. tech companies, including Apple. While some models suggest cautious optimism due to Apple's strong market position and focus on AI, the overall sentiment expressed in the news emphasizes risks associated with geopolitical tensions and competitive threats. This context leads to a more bearish outlook for Apple's stock in the short term, overshadowing any positive catalysts. The predictions from various sources primarily lean towards an expectation of a decline in stock price, thus influencing my estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. While the stock buyback program is a positive factor, the slowing sales of physical products, high P/E ratio, and Buffett's reduced stake are significant concerns. The 'double down' advertisement may mislead readers. Considering the existing predictions from other models, the negative factors outweigh the positive factors slightly, suggesting the stock price is more likely to fall. The trend in previous predictions are mixed. Some models suggest the stock may fall, while other models suggest it may raise up in stock price. However, according to the current data analysis, the stock would more likely fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show modest growth, several factors point towards a higher probability of a price fall. Apple's negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) are significant bearish indicators. Weak sales guidance and the limited initial impact of its AI applications add to the negative sentiment.  The Jefferies downgrade further reinforces this outlook. While Apple historically delivers positive earnings surprises and benefits from being part of the 'Magnificent 7,' the current specific indicators outweigh the general positive tech sector sentiment. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, but a majority lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.  Considering the relatively weak internal factors juxtaposed to the overall positive tech sector sentiment, a slightly bearish outlook is warranted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. On the positive side, Apple's strong position in the technology sector, focus on AI integration (Apple Intelligence), and upcoming iPhone 16 launch are seen as growth drivers. Analysts like Dan Ives predict a 25% rise in tech stocks due to potential deregulation under the Trump administration, and Apple's services revenue showed a 12% YoY increase in Q4 2024. Additionally, hedge fund confidence is notable with 158 holders. However, there are significant risks: slower iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese manufacturers, market volatility from potential policy changes (e.g., tariffs), and mean reversion risks highlighted by analysts. The previous predictions show a divergence, with some models leaning bearish due to competition and valuation concerns, while others are bullish based on AI and services growth. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts appear slightly more compelling, but the risks are substantial enough to warrant caution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.

However, the emergence of positive news or developments could potentially mitigate this negative trend. The mixed predictions from previous models also reflect the uncertainty in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. This integration is now supported in the latest iOS 18.3 update, which could lead to increased adoption and revenue for Apple. Additionally, T-Mobile's positive earnings report may have an indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price due to their partnership.
