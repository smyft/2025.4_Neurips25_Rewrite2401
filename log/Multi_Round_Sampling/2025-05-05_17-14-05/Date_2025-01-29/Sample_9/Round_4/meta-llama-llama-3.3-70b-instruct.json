(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer may lead to negative sentiment around Apple's stock, especially ahead of earnings where expectations can be a significant driver of price movements. The mention of competition in China and lack of compelling AI features suggests that analysts are less optimistic about Apple's growth potential in the current market landscape. Generally, downgrades lead to a higher probability of stock price decline as investors may respond by selling. Therefore, the chances of the stock price falling are significantly higher than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses hedge fund interest in Apple due to its established business, recurring revenue, dividend payouts, and growth pipeline. The mention of new product launches (low-cost iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air) and upgrades to existing products signal potential future growth. The fact that Apple ranks 2nd safest stock to buy according to hedge funds suggests confidence. However, the article also implies other stocks may provide higher returns quicker. While positive, this news is more of a confirmation of Apple's stability rather than a catalyst for explosive growth. Therefore, a minor positive movement is more probable than a significant one, and a fall is less likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy unrelated to Apple's specific performance or prospects.  The article doesn't provide any information about Apple, its financials, or its future. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors or news specific to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s top stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and inclusion in the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF. The article also mentions Bernstein raising its price target for AAPL to $260 and maintaining an Outperform rating, citing favorable IT spending forecasts for 2025. Additionally, Apple reported robust Q4 2024 revenue growth and significant shareholder returns, further reinforcing its financial stability. While there is acknowledgment of volatility and challenges in the IT hardware sector, the overall sentiment is positive, with Apple being a top pick for 2025. The mention of AI services and new product launches (like iPhone 16) also adds to the bullish case. However, the article notes that some hedge funds are underweight on AAPL, which could introduce slight uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's stock performance in 2025. It highlights Apple's strong position with a wide view of its product offerings, AI roadmap, and the potential for growth despite competition. The article also mentions a positive outlook from Rosenblatt Securities, who reiterated their Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $262. Additionally, Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy views Apple's stock positively due to its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. However, the article also notes potential risks and uncertainties in the market, such as the implementation of tariffs and their impact on economic stability and investor confidence. Based on these factors, it seems that the analysts and strategists have a favorable view of Apple's prospects, but there are also concerns about market volatility and competition. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the cautious tone regarding market performance in 2025.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, with an 8% decline. Analysts have been quiet regarding EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The top line revisions have been slightly negative, but stable. The article highlights key metrics to watch, including China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and the uncertain outlook for Apple's growth, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as the App Store through which DeepSeek gained popularity. However, the news does not specifically focus on Apple's direct business metrics or projections. Instead, it highlights the implications for European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Given that Apple is not directly addressed in terms of potential business impacts from DeepSeek, and considering the market stability, it's inferred that the news has a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform raises concerns about Apple's competitive position, particularly in China and its lack of compelling AI features. This leads to a negative sentiment ahead of the earnings report, indicating a higher likelihood of stock price decline. While there are mixed opinions from other analysts indicating some level of sustained interest in Apple, the overall effect of the downgrade, especially so close to earnings, suggests that investors may respond with caution or negativity, increasing the probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on hedge fund interest in Apple due to its stability, dividend payouts, and potential growth through new products. While Apple is ranked as the 2nd safest stock according to hedge funds, the article suggests that other stocks may offer quicker and higher returns. Considering the 'safe haven' aspect and the mixed signals about faster growth potential elsewhere, a moderate positive impact is probable. However, the fact that some stocks are portrayed as having greater return potential could temper expectations of explosive growth in AAPL, preventing a strongly bullish outlook. Comparing to the previous rounds, there is conflicting information. Some models gave high rising probability because of positive outlook, while some indicated otherwise due to downgrade and earnings report. In all, I will give Apple a moderately positive bump.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the general benefits of sector ETFs and doesn't contain any information specific to Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, some optimistic and some pessimistic, based on different news sources and analyses unrelated to this particular article on ETFs. To avoid bias from this irrelevant news, I will base my prediction on the average sentiment of the previous predictions, weighting them equally.  Averaging the previous predictions, (including this round's neutral view), gives a slightly negative overall sentiment. However, the range of opinions highlights the uncertainty inherent in stock market predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s top stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and inclusion in the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing favorable IT spending forecasts for 2025. Apple also reported robust Q4 2024 revenue growth and significant shareholder returns, reinforcing its financial stability. Additionally, the mention of AI services and new product launches (like iPhone 16) adds to the bullish case. However, there are some cautionary notes, such as hedge funds being underweight on AAPL and the IT hardware sector being described as 'structurally challenged.' The previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed sentiment, with some leaning bullish and others bearish. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the strong fundamentals of Apple, but also acknowledging the cautious elements, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's stock performance in 2025, highlighting its strong position with a wide view of its product offerings, AI roadmap, and potential for growth despite competition. Analysts and strategists view Apple's prospects favorably, but there are concerns about market volatility and competition. The article mentions a positive outlook from Rosenblatt Securities, who reiterated their Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $262. Additionally, Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy views Apple's stock positively due to its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. However, potential risks and uncertainties in the market, such as the implementation of tariffs and their impact on economic stability and investor confidence, could affect Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive sentiment but also the cautious tone regarding market performance in 2025, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, with an 8% decline. Analysts have been quiet regarding EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The top line revisions have been slightly negative, but stable. The article also mentions key metrics to watch, including China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and the uncertain outlook for Apple's growth, it seems that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, considering the stability of the company and the potential for positive earnings surprises, the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high. Taking into account the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions from slightly bullish to bearish, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is around 0.4, and the probability of it falling is around 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Apple is mentioned as the platform through which DeepSeek gained popularity. The core message does not directly address Apple's business metrics or projections. While the news indicates a shift in enthusiasm for AI investments, with Citi analysts highlighting broader appeal and diversification beyond mega-cap tech companies, this might imply a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment for Apple. However, the specific context lacking detailed implications for Apple's stock adds uncertainty. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with high confidence predictions both bullish and bearish, indicating market indecision.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform introduces negative sentiment around Apple's stock, primarily due to concerns about competition in China and not having compelling AI features. This sentiment is especially significant ahead of the earnings report, where expectations can heavily influence stock prices. The mixed messages from other analysts show that while some have a mildly positive outlook, they are overshadowed by the concerns raised in the downgrade. Given the context of mixed analyses but predominant caution from multiple sources, I estimate there's a higher likelihood of a stock price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The article discusses hedge fund interest in Apple due to its strong business, recurring revenue, dividend payouts, and growth prospects. The article mentions new product launches and upgrades to existing ones (new low-cost iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air) which could boost revenue. The high number of hedge funds holding AAPL (158) suggests a high degree of institutional confidence. However, the article subtly points out that other stocks may yield higher returns in a shorter timeframe, and that the article ranks AAPL 2nd signaling potential better plays. \n\nConsidering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models were positive due to product launches and dividend growth, while others highlighted downgrades and concerns about AI features. The recent round had many different opinions. Taking all this into account, I believe the news is slightly positive as it provides more info on product launches. Hedge fund interest combined with dividend information can lead to a more positive outlook. I will thus give it a slight bump in rising probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news article is about the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, which is entirely unrelated to Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, this news is highly unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price.  The probability of price movement will be driven by other factors. Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of probabilities, reflecting conflicting signals from various news sources and analyses relating to Apple.  The first round showed predictions ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for the probability of a price rise. The second round had a similar spread, albeit slightly less extreme, with probabilities ranging from 0.25 to 0.7. This inconsistency indicates a high degree of uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price. My prediction, therefore, will reflect the general uncertainty stemming from the lack of relevant information in the given news article, while taking into account the wide divergence of opinion from other models in previous rounds. I will choose probabilities that represent a roughly balanced scenario, reflecting the uncertain market sentiment and irrelevance of the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s top stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and inclusion in the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing favorable IT spending forecasts for 2025. Apple also reported robust Q4 2024 revenue growth and significant shareholder returns, reinforcing its financial stability.

However, there are some cautionary notes, such as hedge funds being underweight on AAPL and the IT hardware sector being described as 'structurally challenged.' The previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed sentiment, with some leaning bullish and others bearish. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the strong fundamentals of Apple, but also acknowledging the cautious elements, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, with an 8% decline. Analysts have been quiet regarding EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The top line revisions have been slightly negative, but stable. Key metrics to watch include China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the bearish sentiment among analysts and the uncertain outlook for Apple's growth, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling. However, considering the stability of the company and the potential for positive earnings surprises, the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Apple is mentioned as the platform through which DeepSeek gained popularity. The core message does not directly address Apple's business metrics or projections. While the news indicates a shift in enthusiasm for AI investments, with Citi analysts highlighting broader appeal and diversification beyond mega-cap tech companies, this might imply a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment for Apple. However, the specific context lacking detailed implications for Apple's stock adds uncertainty. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with high confidence predictions both bullish and bearish, indicating market indecision.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform raises concerns regarding Apple's competitive position, especially in the context of competition in China and inadequate AI features, leading to negative sentiment. Given the timing of the earnings report and the prevailing caution among analysts, the likelihood of stock price decline is significant. Although some analysts express positive sentiment around Apple's stability and product launches, this is somewhat overshadowed by the downgrade's implications. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article discusses hedge fund bullishness on Apple due to several factors: its solid business, recurring revenue, reliable dividends (11 years of growth exceeding sector median), and a growth pipeline with new product launches (low-cost iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air). The article also highlights that the number of hedge fund holders is 158. However, it also acknowledges that other stocks might offer higher returns quicker. \n\nThe contrasting viewpoints in previous rounds and the downgrade cited in several models create uncertainty. Some had concerns over performance in China, and not having compelling AI features. The bullish aspects include the company's dividend growth, new product launches, and inclusion in 'safe stock lists.' Taking into account these factors, while the hedge fund interest is generally positive, the article suggests there may be better opportunities elsewhere. The previous predictions reflect a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, influenced by the hedge fund activity and the news regarding new product lines. However, this is tempered by the article's own caveats and previous analysis stressing a potential downgrade and mixed long term value..\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The provided news article is about the benefits of sector ETFs and is completely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely to have any impact. To predict the probability of Apple's stock price movement, I need to consider the previous predictions which reflect a variety of analyses and news items.  There's significant divergence, ranging from strongly bullish to strongly bearish across multiple models and rounds.  Many predictions give weight to either positive analyst ratings, new product launches, and strong fundamentals, causing optimism; while others emphasize negative analyst downgrades, concerns about competition (especially in China) and the lack of compelling AI features, which create pessimism.  Given this uncertainty, I will avoid strong leaning towards either positive or negative probabilities and settle with a near-neutral probability. The lack of relevant information in the given article necessitates a prediction that takes the widely varying previous predictions into consideration.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s top stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and inclusion in the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing favorable IT spending forecasts for 2025. Apple also reported robust Q4 2024 revenue growth and significant shareholder returns, reinforcing its financial stability. Additionally, the mention of AI services and new product launches (like iPhone 16) adds to the bullish case. However, there are some cautionary notes, such as hedge funds being underweight on AAPL and the IT hardware sector being described as 'structurally challenged.' The previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed sentiment, with some leaning bullish and others bearish. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the strong fundamentals of Apple, but also acknowledging the cautious elements, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Analysts have been quiet regarding EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year, and the top line revisions have been slightly negative but stable. Key metrics to watch include China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and the uncertain outlook for Apple's growth, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling. However, considering the stability of the company and potential for positive earnings surprises, the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high. Taking into account the previous predictions from other models, which show a wide range of opinions, the overall sentiment seems uncertain. Therefore, I will provide a moderate estimate of the probabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape.
