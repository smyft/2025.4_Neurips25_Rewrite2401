(AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\n\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer may lead to negative sentiment around Apple's stock, especially ahead of earnings where expectations can be a significant driver of price movements. The mention of competition in China and lack of compelling AI features suggests that analysts are less optimistic about Apple's growth potential in the current market landscape. Generally, downgrades lead to a higher probability of stock price decline as investors may respond by selling. Therefore, the chances of the stock price falling are significantly higher than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses hedge fund interest in Apple due to its established business, recurring revenue, dividend payouts, and growth pipeline. The mention of new product launches (low-cost iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air) and upgrades to existing products signal potential future growth. The fact that Apple ranks 2nd safest stock to buy according to hedge funds suggests confidence. However, the article also implies other stocks may provide higher returns quicker. While positive, this news is more of a confirmation of Apple's stability rather than a catalyst for explosive growth. Therefore, a minor positive movement is more probable than a significant one, and a fall is less likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy unrelated to Apple's specific performance or prospects.  The article doesn't provide any information about Apple, its financials, or its future. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors or news specific to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s top stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and inclusion in the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF. The article also mentions Bernstein raising its price target for AAPL to $260 and maintaining an Outperform rating, citing favorable IT spending forecasts for 2025. Additionally, Apple reported robust Q4 2024 revenue growth and significant shareholder returns, further reinforcing its financial stability. While there is acknowledgment of volatility and challenges in the IT hardware sector, the overall sentiment is positive, with Apple being a top pick for 2025. The mention of AI services and new product launches (like iPhone 16) also adds to the bullish case. However, the article notes that some hedge funds are underweight on AAPL, which could introduce slight uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's stock performance in 2025. It highlights Apple's strong position with a wide view of its product offerings, AI roadmap, and the potential for growth despite competition. The article also mentions a positive outlook from Rosenblatt Securities, who reiterated their Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $262. Additionally, Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy views Apple's stock positively due to its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. However, the article also notes potential risks and uncertainties in the market, such as the implementation of tariffs and their impact on economic stability and investor confidence. Based on these factors, it seems that the analysts and strategists have a favorable view of Apple's prospects, but there are also concerns about market volatility and competition. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the cautious tone regarding market performance in 2025.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, with an 8% decline. Analysts have been quiet regarding EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The top line revisions have been slightly negative, but stable. The article highlights key metrics to watch, including China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and the uncertain outlook for Apple's growth, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as the App Store through which DeepSeek gained popularity. However, the news does not specifically focus on Apple's direct business metrics or projections. Instead, it highlights the implications for European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Given that Apple is not directly addressed in terms of potential business impacts from DeepSeek, and considering the market stability, it's inferred that the news has a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform raises concerns about Apple's competitive position, particularly in China and its lack of compelling AI features. This leads to a negative sentiment ahead of the earnings report, indicating a higher likelihood of stock price decline. While there are mixed opinions from other analysts indicating some level of sustained interest in Apple, the overall effect of the downgrade, especially so close to earnings, suggests that investors may respond with caution or negativity, increasing the probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on hedge fund interest in Apple due to its stability, dividend payouts, and potential growth through new products. While Apple is ranked as the 2nd safest stock according to hedge funds, the article suggests that other stocks may offer quicker and higher returns. Considering the 'safe haven' aspect and the mixed signals about faster growth potential elsewhere, a moderate positive impact is probable. However, the fact that some stocks are portrayed as having greater return potential could temper expectations of explosive growth in AAPL, preventing a strongly bullish outlook. Comparing to the previous rounds, there is conflicting information. Some models gave high rising probability because of positive outlook, while some indicated otherwise due to downgrade and earnings report. In all, I will give Apple a moderately positive bump.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the general benefits of sector ETFs and doesn't contain any information specific to Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, some optimistic and some pessimistic, based on different news sources and analyses unrelated to this particular article on ETFs. To avoid bias from this irrelevant news, I will base my prediction on the average sentiment of the previous predictions, weighting them equally.  Averaging the previous predictions, (including this round's neutral view), gives a slightly negative overall sentiment. However, the range of opinions highlights the uncertainty inherent in stock market predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s top stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and inclusion in the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing favorable IT spending forecasts for 2025. Apple also reported robust Q4 2024 revenue growth and significant shareholder returns, reinforcing its financial stability. Additionally, the mention of AI services and new product launches (like iPhone 16) adds to the bullish case. However, there are some cautionary notes, such as hedge funds being underweight on AAPL and the IT hardware sector being described as 'structurally challenged.' The previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed sentiment, with some leaning bullish and others bearish. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the strong fundamentals of Apple, but also acknowledging the cautious elements, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's stock performance in 2025, highlighting its strong position with a wide view of its product offerings, AI roadmap, and potential for growth despite competition. Analysts and strategists view Apple's prospects favorably, but there are concerns about market volatility and competition. The article mentions a positive outlook from Rosenblatt Securities, who reiterated their Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $262. Additionally, Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy views Apple's stock positively due to its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. However, potential risks and uncertainties in the market, such as the implementation of tariffs and their impact on economic stability and investor confidence, could affect Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive sentiment but also the cautious tone regarding market performance in 2025, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, with an 8% decline. Analysts have been quiet regarding EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.

Given the bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and the uncertain outlook for Apple's growth, it seems that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, considering the stability of the company and the potential for positive earnings surprises, the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high. Taking into account the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions from slightly bullish to bearish, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is around 0.4, and the probability of it falling is around 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Apple is mentioned as the platform through which DeepSeek gained popularity. The core message does not directly address Apple's business metrics or projections. While the news indicates a shift in enthusiasm for AI investments, with Citi analysts highlighting broader appeal and diversification beyond mega-cap tech companies, this might imply a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment for Apple. However, the specific context lacking detailed implications for Apple's stock adds uncertainty. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with high confidence predictions both bullish and bearish, indicating market indecision.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
