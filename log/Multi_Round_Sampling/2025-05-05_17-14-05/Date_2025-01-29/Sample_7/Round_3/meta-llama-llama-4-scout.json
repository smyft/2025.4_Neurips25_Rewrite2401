      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek has put pressure on mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple, as it raises questions about current valuations and AI spending. Despite this, the report from Citi suggests a positive outlook for European equities, which could shift some investor focus away from U.S. mega-cap stocks. However, given the quick volatility in tech stocks due to such competitive announcements, there is a notable risk that Apple might experience downward pressure in the short term. Overall, the potential for stabilization in markets and the broader appeal of European stocks could offset some negative sentiment towards Apple, but the uncertainty still leans toward a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' is a negative signal. Key concerns include slowing iPhone sales globally, particularly a significant drop in sales volume in China due to competition, and the lack of compelling AI features expected to drive upgrades. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further reinforce a bearish outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released shortly, the downgrade leading up to the report strongly suggests a likely negative near-term stock price movement. The statistics related to China sales are very specific and concerning. A delayed iPhone replacement cycle into 2026 is also a major concern. Overall, this news is overwhelmingly negative, increasing the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news alone is low. Any movement would likely be driven by broader market factors or other Apple-specific news, rather than this Meta announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception can lead to low expected returns. Desai explains that these companies have been spending money on each other, which he likens to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This phenomenon is expected to result in 'pretty low returns.' Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as the App Store through which DeepSeek gained popularity. However, the news does not specifically focus on Apple's direct business metrics or projections. Instead, it highlights the implications for European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Given that Apple is not directly addressed in terms of potential business impacts from DeepSeek, and considering the market stability, it's inferred that the news has a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek and its challenge to the established AI market raises concerns for major tech companies, including Apple, as it questions their current valuations and spending on AI. While some analysts offer a positive view on European stocks speaking to the broader market dynamics, Apple's stock appears vulnerable in the short term due to competitive pressures and recent downgrades that highlight declining sales, especially from China. Given the overall bearish sentiment in tech and continuous competition in the AI space, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline. Most previous predictions lean towards a negative outlook, with significant concerns raised about Apple's near-term performance. Hence, I estimate a moderate likelihood of a price decline and a lower likelihood of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple due to slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling AI features paints a bearish picture. The analysts' concerns about increased competition, reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025, and a potential delay in iPhone replacement cycles further reinforce this negative sentiment and suggest high probability for the stock price to fall. Also, previous round predictors nearly unanimously think that stock price will fall, which reinforces my assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strong performance and AI investments, which has minimal direct impact on Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with several leaning towards a price fall due to factors unrelated to this news (e.g., Oppenheimer downgrade, slowing iPhone sales, concerns about AI competition). While the Meta news is positive for the tech sector generally, it's not a significant driver for Apple's stock price movement in itself.  The consensus from previous models suggests a slight bias towards a price fall, primarily driven by independent negative factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the low overall impact of this particular news item on Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. Previous predictions by other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models predicting a higher likelihood of a fall than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the broader market trends and earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are showing slight increases, and investors are eagerly awaiting earnings reports from tech giants. Apple's stock price movement is likely to be influenced by the overall market sentiment and its upcoming earnings report. Given that the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, have been under scrutiny for their AI spending and the emergence of DeepSeek has raised questions about the valuation of these companies, there is a cautious outlook. However, the market stabilization and positive results from other tech companies could offset some negative sentiment. Based on the information provided and the previous predictions, it seems that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception can lead to low expected returns. Desai explains that these companies have been spending money on each other, which he likens to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This phenomenon is expected to result in 'pretty low returns.' Additionally, the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets may also have a negative effect on Apple's stock price. Considering the analysis from previous rounds, there is a trend of negative predictions, which suggests that the market is leaning towards a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks, with Citi analysts suggesting a broader diversification in earnings growth opportunities outside the 'Magnificent 7' mega-cap tech companies. However, there's limited direct information about Apple's immediate business outcomes or specific financial implications due to DeepSeek's rise. Given Apple's prominence in the mega-cap tech category, the overall market sentiment towards a diversification away from these companies could exert downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Yet, recent negative predictions predominantly point to fundamental issues like iPhone sales decline and competition. With mixed inputs, the market's reaction will depend on broader macroeconomic forces and upcoming earnings reports.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Given the recent emergence of DeepSeek, there is heightened competition in the AI sector, which raises concerns about the current valuations and spending on AI initiatives by major tech companies like Apple. The negative sentiment surrounding Apple's sales, particularly in China, further compounds this pressure. Analysts have noted a transition in investor interest towards European equities, which could detract from the focus on U.S. mega-cap stocks. Previous predictions consistently point towards a greater probability of a price fall due to these underlying issues. The overall market sentiment, combined with the recent downgrades from analysts regarding Apple's performance, suggests a strong likelihood of a price decline over a rise in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple, citing slowing iPhone sales and China market pressures, presents a clearly negative signal. The specific concerns around decreased sales in China and the lack of innovative AI features to drive upgrades are significant. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further solidify this bearish outlook. The upcoming earnings announcement increases the potential for volatility. Furthermore, the trend of previous predictions heavily favors a price decrease. Taking all this into consideration, the probability of a stock price fall is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news about Meta's strong performance and AI investments is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock price movement.  The previous predictions overwhelmingly point towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to several factors: Oppenheimer's downgrade citing slowing iPhone sales (especially in China), lack of compelling AI features, increased competition, and concerns about the broader tech sector's valuation in light of DeepSeek's emergence.  The consensus from multiple models across two rounds reinforces this bearish sentiment. While Meta's success is generally positive for the tech sector, it doesn't offset the significant negative factors specifically impacting Apple. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considerably higher than the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. Previous predictions by other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models predicting a higher likelihood of a fall than a rise. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is deemed higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price movement. The emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on AI investments has raised concerns about the valuations of mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple. However, the market stabilization and positive results from other tech companies could offset some negative sentiment. Given the upcoming earnings reports and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, there is a cautious outlook on Apple's stock price movement. The previous predictions from multiple models suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline due to factors such as slowing iPhone sales, market share losses in China, increased competition, and lack of compelling AI features. The Dow futures dipping by 0.1% and the mixed performance of other tech stocks also contribute to a cautious view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, being viewed as safe assets by investors, but leading to low expected returns due to their spending on each other. This, combined with the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets, may have a negative effect on Apple's stock price. Considering the analysis from previous rounds, there is a trend of negative predictions, which suggests that the market is leaning towards a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise. The overall sentiment from various models and the reasoning provided indicate a cautious outlook for Apple's stock price, with a higher probability of a fall than a rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks, with Citi analysts suggesting a broader diversification in earnings growth opportunities outside the 'Magnificent 7' mega-cap tech companies. There is an overall bearish sentiment fueled by concerns about Apple's iPhone sales, especially in China, and the impact of competition from DeepSeek. Although Citi analyst's views on a positive outlook for European stocks might shift some investor focus, the predominant negative signals, especially regarding the iPhone sales and recent downgrades, suggest that there is a higher probability of a price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
