(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\nNews Content: Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\n\nChip stocks lift Nasdaq futures ahead of Fed rate decision\n\nSemicaps stocks rise following strong ASML earnings\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek has put pressure on mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple, as it raises questions about current valuations and AI spending. Despite this, the report from Citi suggests a positive outlook for European equities, which could shift some investor focus away from U.S. mega-cap stocks. However, given the quick volatility in tech stocks due to such competitive announcements, there is a notable risk that Apple might experience downward pressure in the short term. Overall, the potential for stabilization in markets and the broader appeal of European stocks could offset some negative sentiment towards Apple, but the uncertainty still leans toward a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' is a negative signal. Key concerns include slowing iPhone sales globally, particularly a significant drop in sales volume in China due to competition, and the lack of compelling AI features expected to drive upgrades. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further reinforce a bearish outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released shortly, the downgrade leading up to the report strongly suggests a likely negative near-term stock price movement. The statistics related to China sales are very specific and concerning. A delayed iPhone replacement cycle into 2026 is also a major concern. Overall, this news is overwhelmingly negative, increasing the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news alone is low. Any movement would likely be driven by broader market factors or other Apple-specific news, rather than this Meta announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception can lead to low expected returns. Desai explains that these companies have been spending money on each other, which he likens to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This phenomenon is expected to result in 'pretty low returns.' Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as the App Store through which DeepSeek gained popularity. However, the news does not specifically focus on Apple's direct business metrics or projections. Instead, it highlights the implications for European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Given that Apple is not directly addressed in terms of potential business impacts from DeepSeek, and considering the market stability, it's inferred that the news has a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek and its challenge to the established AI market raises concerns for major tech companies, including Apple, as it questions their current valuations and spending on AI. While some analysts offer a positive view on European stocks speaking to the broader market dynamics, Apple's stock appears vulnerable in the short term due to competitive pressures and recent downgrades that highlight declining sales, especially from China. Given the overall bearish sentiment in tech and continuous competition in the AI space, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline. Most previous predictions lean towards a negative outlook, with significant concerns raised about Apple's near-term performance. Hence, I estimate a moderate likelihood of a price decline and a lower likelihood of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple due to slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling AI features paints a bearish picture. The analysts' concerns about increased competition, reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025, and a potential delay in iPhone replacement cycles further reinforce this negative sentiment and suggest high probability for the stock price to fall. Also, previous round predictors nearly unanimously think that stock price will fall, which reinforces my assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strong performance and AI investments, which has minimal direct impact on Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with several leaning towards a price fall due to factors unrelated to this news (e.g., Oppenheimer downgrade, slowing iPhone sales, concerns about AI competition). While the Meta news is positive for the tech sector generally, it's not a significant driver for Apple's stock price movement in itself.  The consensus from previous models suggests a slight bias towards a price fall, primarily driven by independent negative factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the low overall impact of this particular news item on Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. Previous predictions by other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models predicting a higher likelihood of a fall than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the broader market trends and earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are showing slight increases, and investors are eagerly awaiting earnings reports from tech giants. Apple's stock price movement is likely to be influenced by the overall market sentiment and its upcoming earnings report. Given that the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, have been under scrutiny for their AI spending and the emergence of DeepSeek has raised questions about the valuation of these companies, there is a cautious outlook. However, the market stabilization and positive results from other tech companies could offset some negative sentiment. Based on the information provided and the previous predictions, it seems that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception can lead to low expected returns. Desai explains that these companies have been spending money on each other, which he likens to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This phenomenon is expected to result in 'pretty low returns.' Additionally, the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets may also have a negative effect on Apple's stock price. Considering the analysis from previous rounds, there is a trend of negative predictions, which suggests that the market is leaning towards a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks, with Citi analysts suggesting a broader diversification in earnings growth opportunities outside the 'Magnificent 7' mega-cap tech companies. However, there's limited direct information about Apple's immediate business outcomes or specific financial implications due to DeepSeek's rise. Given Apple's prominence in the mega-cap tech category, the overall market sentiment towards a diversification away from these companies could exert downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Yet, recent negative predictions predominantly point to fundamental issues like iPhone sales decline and competition. With mixed inputs, the market's reaction will depend on broader macroeconomic forces and upcoming earnings reports.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Given the recent emergence of DeepSeek, there is heightened competition in the AI sector, which raises concerns about the current valuations and spending on AI initiatives by major tech companies like Apple. The negative sentiment surrounding Apple's sales, particularly in China, further compounds this pressure. Analysts have noted a transition in investor interest towards European equities, which could detract from the focus on U.S. mega-cap stocks. Previous predictions consistently point towards a greater probability of a price fall due to these underlying issues. The overall market sentiment, combined with the recent downgrades from analysts regarding Apple's performance, suggests a strong likelihood of a price decline over a rise in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple, citing slowing iPhone sales and China market pressures, presents a clearly negative signal. The specific concerns around decreased sales in China and the lack of innovative AI features to drive upgrades are significant. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further solidify this bearish outlook. The upcoming earnings announcement increases the potential for volatility. Furthermore, the trend of previous predictions heavily favors a price decrease. Taking all this into consideration, the probability of a stock price fall is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news about Meta's strong performance and AI investments is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock price movement.  The previous predictions overwhelmingly point towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to several factors: Oppenheimer's downgrade citing slowing iPhone sales (especially in China), lack of compelling AI features, increased competition, and concerns about the broader tech sector's valuation in light of DeepSeek's emergence.  The consensus from multiple models across two rounds reinforces this bearish sentiment. While Meta's success is generally positive for the tech sector, it doesn't offset the significant negative factors specifically impacting Apple. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considerably higher than the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. Previous predictions by other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models predicting a higher likelihood of a fall than a rise. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is deemed higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price movement. The emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on AI investments has raised concerns about the valuations of mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple. However, the market stabilization and positive results from other tech companies could offset some negative sentiment. Given the upcoming earnings reports and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, there is a cautious outlook on Apple's stock price movement. The previous predictions from multiple models suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline due to factors such as slowing iPhone sales, market share losses in China, increased competition, and lack of compelling AI features. The Dow futures dipping by 0.1% and the mixed performance of other tech stocks also contribute to a cautious view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, being viewed as safe assets by investors, but leading to low expected returns due to their spending on each other. This, combined with the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets, may have a negative effect on Apple's stock price. Considering the analysis from previous rounds, there is a trend of negative predictions, which suggests that the market is leaning towards a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise. The overall sentiment from various models and the reasoning provided indicate a cautious outlook for Apple's stock price, with a higher probability of a fall than a rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks, with Citi analysts suggesting a broader diversification in earnings growth opportunities outside the 'Magnificent 7' mega-cap tech companies. There is an overall bearish sentiment fueled by concerns about Apple's iPhone sales, especially in China, and the impact of competition from DeepSeek. Although Citi analyst's views on a positive outlook for European stocks might shift some investor focus, the predominant negative signals, especially regarding the iPhone sales and recent downgrades, suggest that there is a higher probability of a price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
