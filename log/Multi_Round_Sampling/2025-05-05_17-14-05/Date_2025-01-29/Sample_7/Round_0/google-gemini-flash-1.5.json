While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news alone is low. Any movement would likely be driven by broader market factors or other Apple-specific news, rather than this Meta announcement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```\n"
