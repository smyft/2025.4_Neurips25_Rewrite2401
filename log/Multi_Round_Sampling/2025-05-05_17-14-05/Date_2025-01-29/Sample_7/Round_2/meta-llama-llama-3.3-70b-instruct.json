(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek has put pressure on mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple, as it raises questions about current valuations and AI spending. Despite this, the report from Citi suggests a positive outlook for European equities, which could shift some investor focus away from U.S. mega-cap stocks. However, given the quick volatility in tech stocks due to such competitive announcements, there is a notable risk that Apple might experience downward pressure in the short term. Overall, the potential for stabilization in markets and the broader appeal of European stocks could offset some negative sentiment towards Apple, but the uncertainty still leans toward a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' is a negative signal. Key concerns include slowing iPhone sales globally, particularly a significant drop in sales volume in China due to competition, and the lack of compelling AI features expected to drive upgrades. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further reinforce a bearish outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released shortly, the downgrade leading up to the report strongly suggests a likely negative near-term stock price movement. The statistics related to China sales are very specific and concerning. A delayed iPhone replacement cycle into 2026 is also a major concern. Overall, this news is overwhelmingly negative, increasing the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news alone is low. Any movement would likely be driven by broader market factors or other Apple-specific news, rather than this Meta announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception can lead to low expected returns. Desai explains that these companies have been spending money on each other, which he likens to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This phenomenon is expected to result in 'pretty low returns.' Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as the App Store through which DeepSeek gained popularity. However, the news does not specifically focus on Apple's direct business metrics or projections. Instead, it highlights the implications for European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Given that Apple is not directly addressed in terms of potential business impacts from DeepSeek, and considering the market stability, it's inferred that the news has a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek and its challenge to the established AI market raises concerns for major tech companies, including Apple, as it questions their current valuations and spending on AI. While some analysts offer a positive view on European stocks speaking to the broader market dynamics, Apple's stock appears vulnerable in the short term due to competitive pressures and recent downgrades that highlight declining sales, especially from China. Given the overall bearish sentiment in tech and continuous competition in the AI space, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline. Most previous predictions lean towards a negative outlook, with significant concerns raised about Apple's near-term performance. Hence, I estimate a moderate likelihood of a price decline and a lower likelihood of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple due to slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling AI features paints a bearish picture. The analysts' concerns about increased competition, reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025, and a potential delay in iPhone replacement cycles further reinforce this negative sentiment and suggest high probability for the stock price to fall. Also, previous round predictors nearly unanimously think that stock price will fall, which reinforces my assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strong performance and AI investments, which has minimal direct impact on Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with several leaning towards a price fall due to factors unrelated to this news (e.g., Oppenheimer downgrade, slowing iPhone sales, concerns about AI competition). While the Meta news is positive for the tech sector generally, it's not a significant driver for Apple's stock price movement in itself.  The consensus from previous models suggests a slight bias towards a price fall, primarily driven by independent negative factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the low overall impact of this particular news item on Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. Previous predictions by other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models predicting a higher likelihood of a fall than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the broader market trends and earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are showing slight increases, and investors are eagerly awaiting earnings reports from tech giants. Apple's stock price movement is likely to be influenced by the overall market sentiment and its upcoming earnings report. Given that the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, have been under scrutiny for their AI spending and the emergence of DeepSeek has raised questions about the valuation of these companies, there is a cautious outlook. However, the market stabilization and positive results from other tech companies could offset some negative sentiment. Based on the information provided and the previous predictions, it seems that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception can lead to low expected returns. Desai explains that these companies have been spending money on each other, which he likens to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This phenomenon is expected to result in 'pretty low returns.' Additionally, the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets may also have a negative effect on Apple's stock price. Considering the analysis from previous rounds, there is a trend of negative predictions, which suggests that the market is leaning towards a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks, with Citi analysts suggesting a broader diversification in earnings growth opportunities outside the 'Magnificent 7' mega-cap tech companies. However, there's limited direct information about Apple's immediate business outcomes or specific financial implications due to DeepSeek's rise. Given Apple's prominence in the mega-cap tech category, the overall market sentiment towards a diversification away from these companies could exert downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Yet, recent negative predictions predominantly point to fundamental issues like iPhone sales decline and competition. With mixed inputs, the market's reaction will depend on broader macroeconomic forces and upcoming earnings reports.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
