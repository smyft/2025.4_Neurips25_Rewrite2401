      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\nNews Content: Revenue grows to $48.4 billion, helping fuel the chief executive\u2019s bets on augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek has put pressure on mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple, as it raises questions about current valuations and AI spending. Despite this, the report from Citi suggests a positive outlook for European equities, which could shift some investor focus away from U.S. mega-cap stocks. However, given the quick volatility in tech stocks due to such competitive announcements, there is a notable risk that Apple might experience downward pressure in the short term. Overall, the potential for stabilization in markets and the broader appeal of European stocks could offset some negative sentiment towards Apple, but the uncertainty still leans toward a higher likelihood of a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' is a negative signal. Key concerns include slowing iPhone sales globally, particularly a significant drop in sales volume in China due to competition, and the lack of compelling AI features expected to drive upgrades. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further reinforce a bearish outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released shortly, the downgrade leading up to the report strongly suggests a likely negative near-term stock price movement. The statistics related to China sales are very specific and concerning. A delayed iPhone replacement cycle into 2026 is also a major concern. Overall, this news is overwhelmingly negative, increasing the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news alone is low. Any movement would likely be driven by broader market factors or other Apple-specific news, rather than this Meta announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, along with increased competition and lack of compelling AI applications. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue/EPS forecasts further indicate bearish sentiment. Given the negative outlook and upcoming earnings report, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception can lead to low expected returns. Desai explains that these companies have been spending money on each other, which he likens to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This phenomenon is expected to result in 'pretty low returns.' Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as the App Store through which DeepSeek gained popularity. However, the news does not specifically focus on Apple's direct business metrics or projections. Instead, it highlights the implications for European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Given that Apple is not directly addressed in terms of potential business impacts from DeepSeek, and considering the market stability, it's inferred that the news has a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Previous predictions are mixed, with several leaning towards a price fall due to factors unrelated to this news (e.g., Oppenheimer downgrade, slowing iPhone sales, concerns about AI competition). While the Meta news is positive for the tech sector generally, it's not a significant driver for Apple's stock price movement in itself.  The consensus from previous models suggests a slight bias towards a price fall, primarily driven by independent negative factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the low overall impact of this particular news item on Apple's stock.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```\n"
