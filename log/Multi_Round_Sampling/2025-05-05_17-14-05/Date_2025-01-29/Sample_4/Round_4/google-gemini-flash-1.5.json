      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\nNews Content: Revenue grows to $48.4 billion, helping fuel the chief executive\u2019s bets on augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer reflects concerns over Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and market share decline in China, leading to a negative outlook for the company's long-term growth. The reduction in earnings estimates and revenue forecasts, coupled with the drop in market share, suggests that investor sentiment will likely shift towards caution. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI capital expenditure (CAPEX) for Big Tech companies. While Apple is not explicitly mentioned regarding earnings in this specific article, the broader discussion around hyperscalers' commitment to AI and their usage of high-end NVIDIA chips is broadly relevant to Apple, given their own AI efforts and reliance on chip vendors. The expert opinion emphasizes the CEO's commentary and 'body language' as key indicators. Since the article introduces a slightly cautious tone because of 'lack of clarity' of current AI development; the probability is less inclined to rise dramatically.. I will infer a slightly higher probability of fall than rise based on the uncertainty mentioned.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news is low.  Any movement would likely be driven by other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this Meta announcement.  A slight upward movement is slightly more likely due to the general positive sentiment in tech associated with AI success, but the correlation is weak.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, citing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone suggests short-term uncertainty and potential negative sentiment, but with a long-term hold recommendation. Given the mixed signals\u2014immediate negative expectations vs. long-term confidence\u2014the stock may face downward pressure in the short term but could stabilize or recover later.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. (AAPL). Meta Platforms' sales growth and its implications for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending on AI, augmented reality, and other technologies do not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or stock performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this news will have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, if we must assign probabilities based on indirect market sentiment, a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations might be considered. Given the lack of direct relevance, I would estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising marginally due to overall market sentiment rather than this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's sales are likely to be hurt by AI delays and Chinese competition, which may lead to tepid quarterly revenue growth. The company's slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition have weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season. Additionally, the strengthening U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates. These factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strategic collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate the Starlink satellite network into iPhones. This partnership not only diversifies Apple's satellite communications capability, adding value for customers by offering more reliable connectivity, but also showcases Apple's commitment to technological innovation. While the market reaction may initially be mixed due to competition with Globalstar, the long-term prospects for increased user engagement and potentially new revenue streams suggest positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and shrinking market share in China, which are critical for the company. The reduction in earnings estimates and revenue forecasts reinforces a negative sentiment among investors. Given these adverse developments, there is a prevailing belief that Apple's stock will face downward pressure. Most predictions from previous analyses suggest a higher probability of stock price decline due to these factors, reaffirming a cautious outlook for Apple in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI capex for Big Tech, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly mention Apple's earnings, it emphasizes the crucial role of AI investments and CEO commentary on these investments. The general sentiment is that clarity and commitment to AI spending are vital for market confidence. Given the cautious tone regarding 'lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model,' coupled with Kaiser's highlight on CEO's commitment to CapEx spend, the stock's movement potential are highly correlated to Apple's announcement regarding AI capex. The previous predictions are quite scattered, ranging from 0.25 to 0.7, with a tendency of people thinking it will fall at the beginning, but being positive at the end. Considering everything, there remain uncertainty, so I will give an equal share of rising and falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strong performance and AI investments.  This has minimal direct impact on Apple. Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting a lack of clear correlation between the Meta news and Apple's stock price. Some models highlight concerns about Apple's own performance (iPhone sales, AI progress, competition), while others emphasize the overall positive sentiment around AI in the tech sector.  Given the indirect nature of the news and the conflicting predictions, I lean towards a neutral stance.  The slight majority of previous predictions indicate a slightly higher probability of a price fall, mostly due to concerns unrelated to the provided news. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a fall but acknowledge the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of the earnings season. Cramer describes the upcoming earnings report as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment,' citing potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, emphasizing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone suggests short-term uncertainty and potential negative sentiment, but with a long-term hold recommendation. Given the mixed signals\u2014immediate negative expectations versus long-term confidence\u2014the stock may face downward pressure in the short term but could stabilize or recover later. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, and the neutral to slightly positive sentiment from some models, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content focus on Meta Platforms' record sales and increased spending on AI and augmented reality, which does not directly relate to Apple's business performance or prospects. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple Inc. (AAPL), the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector related to AI and the potential for increased investment in technology, a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations might be considered. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to general market sentiment rather than this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's sales are likely to be hurt by AI delays and Chinese competition, which may lead to tepid quarterly revenue growth. The company's slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition have weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season. Additionally, the strengthening U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns over iPhone sales slowdown, market share decline in China, and AI development uncertainties, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strategic collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate the Starlink satellite network into iPhones. This partnership not only diversifies Apple's satellite communications capability, adding value for customers by offering more reliable connectivity, but also showcases Apple's commitment to technological innovation. While the market reaction may initially be mixed due to competition with Globalstar, the long-term prospects for increased user engagement and potentially new revenue streams suggest positive sentiment. Previous predictions indicate mixed sentiments with a trend towards caution, but this significant strategic move could overshadow recent negative trends.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer presents significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and declining market share in China, which are core elements for Apple's revenue generation. This negative outlook, compounded by lowered earnings estimates and revenue forecasts, suggests caution among investors. The overall sentiment is dominated by fears of diminishing growth potential due to increased competition, particularly in the Chinese market. Previous predictions indicate a trend towards a higher probability of stock price decline, and despite some mixed predictions suggesting slight upward potential, the negative factors weigh more heavily. Therefore, I estimate a probability of stock price fall at 0.75 and a rise at 0.25.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI capex for Big Tech companies, with emphasis on CEO commentary regarding commitment and vitality of this spending. This is particularly relevant for Apple as investors will be looking for signals on their AI strategy and investment. Stuart Kaiser's comments suggest that perceived commitment is crucial for market confidence. \n\nLooking at previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, from significant bearishness to cautious optimism. The downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales in China have driven the bearish views, while some see the potential for positive sentiment based on a collaboration with SpaceX (though that news is not in the current context). Overall, the predictions have been trending toward slightly more pessimism across the last round. Therefore, it's still a mixed outlook, but I am weighing that the current news is about AI investment plans, which will need a convincing narrative from Apple's CEO to drive market confidence, but the lack of clarity on the company position increase the chances that the stock will fall. I lean cautiously towards a slight decrease in price. However, given the focus on long-term AI investments, its impact may not be immediate depending on guidance announced.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strong performance and AI investments, which has minimal direct impact on Apple.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the lack of direct correlation between the Meta news and Apple's stock price.  Many models highlight existing concerns about Apple's performance: iPhone sales slowdown, AI progress, competition,  and the strengthening dollar.  While some models point to a positive overall sentiment around AI in the tech sector, the negative sentiment around Apple's individual performance outweighs this.  The news itself is essentially neutral for Apple. Therefore, I'm basing my prediction more on the existing concerns about Apple than on the Meta news. The consensus from prior rounds leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily due to factors unrelated to the provided news about Meta. I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect this cautious outlook, with a slight edge towards a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content reflect Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc.

Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, emphasizing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone suggests short-term uncertainty and potential negative sentiment, but with a long-term hold recommendation. Given the mixed signals\u2014immediate negative expectations versus long-term confidence\u2014the stock may face downward pressure in the short term but could stabilize or recover later. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, and the neutral to slightly positive sentiment from some models, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content focus on Meta Platforms' record sales and increased spending on AI and augmented reality, which does not directly relate to Apple's business performance or prospects. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple Inc. (AAPL), the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector related to AI and the potential for increased investment in technology, a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations might be considered. The previous predictions from various models indicate mixed sentiments with a trend towards caution, but no clear consensus on a significant movement due to this specific news. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to general market sentiment rather than this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition' suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales due to delays in artificial intelligence features and tough competition in the Chinese market. The slow roll-out of AI features and the decline in iPhone demand during the holiday season, coupled with a strengthening U.S. dollar, may lead to tepid quarterly revenue growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising. The analysis of previous predictions shows a trend towards caution, with most models indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns over iPhone sales slowdown, market share decline in China, and AI development uncertainties.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strategic collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate the Starlink satellite network into iPhones. This partnership not only diversifies Apple's satellite communications capability, adding value for customers by offering more reliable connectivity, but also showcases Apple's commitment to technological innovation. While the market reaction may initially be mixed due to competition with Globalstar, the long-term prospects for increased user engagement and potentially new revenue streams suggest positive sentiment. Previous predictions indicate mixed sentiments with a trend towards caution, but this significant strategic move could overshadow recent negative trends.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer highlights significant concerns about Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and shrinking market share, particularly in the crucial Chinese market. With lowered earnings and revenue forecasts, investor sentiment is likely to lean towards caution, driving expectations for a price decline. Even though some analysts show mixed views, suggesting minor chances for a price rise, the overall negative sentiment, primarily driven by competition and weak sales projections, indicates a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The primary news focuses on the importance of AI capex and CEO commentary for Big Tech companies. The market's reaction to Apple's earnings and, more importantly, their forward guidance on AI spending will be crucial. The expert highlights the importance of CEO \"body language\" and commitment to high-end NVIDIA chips. Previous predictions are broadly negative, citing iPhone sales slowdown, competition in China, and AI delays as primary concerns. While there's a mix of opinions, the overall trend leans towards caution. Given this and focusing on the AI narrative now, I believe the impact relies on the clarity and confidence Apple's CEO conveys regarding AI investments. Without strong evidence of Apple's AI commitment, caution will continue to prevail.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Meta's strong performance and AI investment is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock price movement.  The previous predictions are highly divergent, reflecting the lack of a direct causal link between the Meta news and AAPL's performance.  However, the consistent underlying theme in previous analyses is concern regarding Apple's own prospects: slowing iPhone sales, challenges in the Chinese market, and uncertainty about their AI strategy. These concerns, rather than the Meta news, are the primary drivers of the prediction. The weight of evidence from multiple models consistently points towards a higher likelihood of a price drop due to these Apple-specific issues.  While some models highlight the potential positive impact of Apple's broader tech sector involvement in AI and the potential deal with SpaceX, these factors are less immediate and seem to be outweighed by the negative predictions surrounding AAPL's anticipated earnings report and performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content reflect Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc.
