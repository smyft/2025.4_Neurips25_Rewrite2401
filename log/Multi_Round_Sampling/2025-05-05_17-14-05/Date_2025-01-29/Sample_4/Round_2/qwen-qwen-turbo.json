(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThe companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer reflects concerns over Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and market share decline in China, leading to a negative outlook for the company's long-term growth. The reduction in earnings estimates and revenue forecasts, coupled with the drop in market share, suggests that investor sentiment will likely shift towards caution. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI capital expenditure (CAPEX) for Big Tech companies. While Apple is not explicitly mentioned regarding earnings in this specific article, the broader discussion around hyperscalers' commitment to AI and their usage of high-end NVIDIA chips is broadly relevant to Apple, given their own AI efforts and reliance on chip vendors. The expert opinion emphasizes the CEO's commentary and 'body language' as key indicators. Since the article introduces a slightly cautious tone because of 'lack of clarity' of current AI development; the probability is less inclined to rise dramatically.. I will infer a slightly higher probability of fall than rise based on the uncertainty mentioned.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news is low.  Any movement would likely be driven by other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this Meta announcement.  A slight upward movement is slightly more likely due to the general positive sentiment in tech associated with AI success, but the correlation is weak.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, citing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone suggests short-term uncertainty and potential negative sentiment, but with a long-term hold recommendation. Given the mixed signals\u2014immediate negative expectations vs. long-term confidence\u2014the stock may face downward pressure in the short term but could stabilize or recover later.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. (AAPL). Meta Platforms' sales growth and its implications for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending on AI, augmented reality, and other technologies do not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or stock performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this news will have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, if we must assign probabilities based on indirect market sentiment, a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations might be considered. Given the lack of direct relevance, I would estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising marginally due to overall market sentiment rather than this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's sales are likely to be hurt by AI delays and Chinese competition, which may lead to tepid quarterly revenue growth. The company's slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition have weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season. Additionally, the strengthening U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates. These factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strategic collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate the Starlink satellite network into iPhones. This partnership not only diversifies Apple's satellite communications capability, adding value for customers by offering more reliable connectivity, but also showcases Apple's commitment to technological innovation. While the market reaction may initially be mixed due to competition with Globalstar, the long-term prospects for increased user engagement and potentially new revenue streams suggest positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and shrinking market share in China, which are critical for the company. The reduction in earnings estimates and revenue forecasts reinforces a negative sentiment among investors. Given these adverse developments, there is a prevailing belief that Apple's stock will face downward pressure. Most predictions from previous analyses suggest a higher probability of stock price decline due to these factors, reaffirming a cautious outlook for Apple in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI capex for Big Tech, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly mention Apple's earnings, it emphasizes the crucial role of AI investments and CEO commentary on these investments. The general sentiment is that clarity and commitment to AI spending are vital for market confidence. Given the cautious tone regarding 'lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model,' coupled with Kaiser's highlight on CEO's commitment to CapEx spend, the stock's movement potential are highly correlated to Apple's announcement regarding AI capex. The previous predictions are quite scattered, ranging from 0.25 to 0.7, with a tendency of people thinking it will fall at the beginning, but being positive at the end. Considering everything, there remain uncertainty, so I will give an equal share of rising and falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strong performance and AI investments.  This has minimal direct impact on Apple. Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting a lack of clear correlation between the Meta news and Apple's stock price. Some models highlight concerns about Apple's own performance (iPhone sales, AI progress, competition), while others emphasize the overall positive sentiment around AI in the tech sector.  Given the indirect nature of the news and the conflicting predictions, I lean towards a neutral stance.  The slight majority of previous predictions indicate a slightly higher probability of a price fall, mostly due to concerns unrelated to the provided news. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a fall but acknowledge the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of the earnings season. Cramer describes the upcoming earnings report as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment,' citing potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, emphasizing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone suggests short-term uncertainty and potential negative sentiment, but with a long-term hold recommendation. Given the mixed signals\u2014immediate negative expectations versus long-term confidence\u2014the stock may face downward pressure in the short term but could stabilize or recover later. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, and the neutral to slightly positive sentiment from some models, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content focus on Meta Platforms' record sales and increased spending on AI and augmented reality, which does not directly relate to Apple's business performance or prospects. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple Inc. (AAPL), the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector related to AI and the potential for increased investment in technology, a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations might be considered. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to general market sentiment rather than this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's sales are likely to be hurt by AI delays and Chinese competition, which may lead to tepid quarterly revenue growth.

Additionally, the strengthening U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns over iPhone sales slowdown, market share decline in China, and AI development uncertainties, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strategic collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate the Starlink satellite network into iPhones.
