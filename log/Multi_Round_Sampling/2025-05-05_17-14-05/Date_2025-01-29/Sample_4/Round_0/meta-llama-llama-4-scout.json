Meta Platforms' sales growth and its implications for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending on AI, augmented reality, and other technologies do not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or stock performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this news will have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, if we must assign probabilities based on indirect market sentiment, a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations might be considered. Given the lack of direct relevance, I would estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising marginally due to overall market sentiment rather than this specific news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
