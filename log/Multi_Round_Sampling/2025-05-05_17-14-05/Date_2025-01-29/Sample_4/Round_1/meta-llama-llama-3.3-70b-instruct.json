(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition\nNews Content: By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth on Thursday as its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season.\n\nThe company and its rivals Google and Samsung have been leaning on AI to drive sales of their devices. But Apple's latest iPhone 16 series lacked such features at launch in September and some of its AI services, including an improved Siri, are only expected later this year in some regions.\n\nApple's challenges with AI were highlighted this month when it had to pull a news-summarizing AI tool due to inaccurate headlines, which drew criticism from the BBC and other news outlets.\n\n\"AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple's handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\" said Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns Apple shares.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei as well as other Chinese smartphone makers, Apple saw its share of the global smartphone market narrow to 23% in the final three months of 2024 from almost 25% a year earlier, according to IDC data.\n\nThe decline was steeper in China - its third-largest market - where Apple's share fell by 10 percentage points to 17%, the data showed.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has been offering subsidies to smartphone purchasers to boost domestic consumption, these subsidies target low- to mid-tier phones priced below $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nWorries about iPhone demand have weighed on Apple shares this year, dragging them 5% lower so far in January.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to post revenue growth of 3.8% for the three months to December, Apple's first fiscal quarter, according to data from LSEG. That is well below the 6.1% growth the company posted in the September quarter, which included only a few days of new iPhone sales.\n\nSales of iPhone will likely tick up 1.9% in the first quarter, weaker than the 5.5% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nMac sales are expected to rise 2.3%, slightly faster compared with the previous three months, while iPad revenue is expected to increase by 4.2%, a slower pace than the fourth quarter.\n\nThe services business, which has in recent years outpaced growth in Apple's devices, is expected to post an increase of 12.9% in sales.\n\nLike other companies with a large global presence, Apple is also set to be hit by a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened by nearly 8% in the final three months of 2024 amid expectations for trade tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"With more than 50% of sales coming from outside of the Americas, the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen in the December quarter could make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates,\" warned Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer reflects concerns over Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and market share decline in China, leading to a negative outlook for the company's long-term growth. The reduction in earnings estimates and revenue forecasts, coupled with the drop in market share, suggests that investor sentiment will likely shift towards caution. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI capital expenditure (CAPEX) for Big Tech companies. While Apple is not explicitly mentioned regarding earnings in this specific article, the broader discussion around hyperscalers' commitment to AI and their usage of high-end NVIDIA chips is broadly relevant to Apple, given their own AI efforts and reliance on chip vendors. The expert opinion emphasizes the CEO's commentary and 'body language' as key indicators. Since the article introduces a slightly cautious tone because of 'lack of clarity' of current AI development; the probability is less inclined to rise dramatically.. I will infer a slightly higher probability of fall than rise based on the uncertainty mentioned.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news is low.  Any movement would likely be driven by other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this Meta announcement.  A slight upward movement is slightly more likely due to the general positive sentiment in tech associated with AI success, but the correlation is weak.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, citing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone suggests short-term uncertainty and potential negative sentiment, but with a long-term hold recommendation. Given the mixed signals\u2014immediate negative expectations vs. long-term confidence\u2014the stock may face downward pressure in the short term but could stabilize or recover later.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. (AAPL). Meta Platforms' sales growth and its implications for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending on AI, augmented reality, and other technologies do not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or stock performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this news will have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, if we must assign probabilities based on indirect market sentiment, a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations might be considered. Given the lack of direct relevance, I would estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising marginally due to overall market sentiment rather than this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's sales are likely to be hurt by AI delays and Chinese competition, which may lead to tepid quarterly revenue growth. The company's slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition have weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season. Additionally, the strengthening U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates. These factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strategic collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate the Starlink satellite network into iPhones. This partnership not only diversifies Apple's satellite communications capability, adding value for customers by offering more reliable connectivity, but also showcases Apple's commitment to technological innovation. While the market reaction may initially be mixed due to competition with Globalstar, the long-term prospects for increased user engagement and potentially new revenue streams suggest positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
