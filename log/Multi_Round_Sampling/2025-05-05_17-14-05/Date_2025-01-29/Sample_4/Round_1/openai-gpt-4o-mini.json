      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer as iPhone Sales Slow, China Market Shrinks\nNews Content: Jan 29- Shares of Tech Gaint Apple (AAPL, Financial) remained low on early trading on Wednesday, losing 1.5%share value after Oppenheimer downgraded shares from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", saying longer-term prospects are weaker than previously expected on iPhone sales projections that have come in weaker than polled estimates and increasing competition in China. The firm also tweaked its view on Apple's valuation and short-term growth prospects, cutting its previous $250 price target due to worries about the firm.\n\nThe EBITDA margin, however, climbed year on year, and Oppenheimer cut the fiscal year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 4% to $7.95, below the consensus estimate of $8.23. Firm drops Apple revenue forecast to $438 billion in FY26 from $456 billion. The revisions were blamed on iPhone demand slowdown, and analysts lowered their projected shipment growth for FY25 to 2% from 5% and kept an outlook of 2% for FY26.\n\nApple's falling market share in China is a major concern: iPhone shipments in Q4 dropped 25%, and the full year 2024 fell 17% for the iPhone, Canalys said. With local Android manufacturers pressuring Apple's dominance, market share dropped from 19% to 15%.\n\nApple will likely struggle to maintain premium valuation and revenue momentum in the years ahead as it battles with competitive headwinds and sluggish iPhone sales, analysts warn.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer reflects concerns over Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and market share decline in China, leading to a negative outlook for the company's long-term growth. The reduction in earnings estimates and revenue forecasts, coupled with the drop in market share, suggests that investor sentiment will likely shift towards caution. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI capital expenditure (CAPEX) for Big Tech companies. While Apple is not explicitly mentioned regarding earnings in this specific article, the broader discussion around hyperscalers' commitment to AI and their usage of high-end NVIDIA chips is broadly relevant to Apple, given their own AI efforts and reliance on chip vendors. The expert opinion emphasizes the CEO's commentary and 'body language' as key indicators. Since the article introduces a slightly cautious tone because of 'lack of clarity' of current AI development; the probability is less inclined to rise dramatically.. I will infer a slightly higher probability of fall than rise based on the uncertainty mentioned.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news is low.  Any movement would likely be driven by other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this Meta announcement.  A slight upward movement is slightly more likely due to the general positive sentiment in tech associated with AI success, but the correlation is weak.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, citing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone suggests short-term uncertainty and potential negative sentiment, but with a long-term hold recommendation. Given the mixed signals\u2014immediate negative expectations vs. long-term confidence\u2014the stock may face downward pressure in the short term but could stabilize or recover later.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. (AAPL). Meta Platforms' sales growth and its implications for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending on AI, augmented reality, and other technologies do not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or stock performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this news will have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, if we must assign probabilities based on indirect market sentiment, a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations might be considered. Given the lack of direct relevance, I would estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising marginally due to overall market sentiment rather than this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's sales are likely to be hurt by AI delays and Chinese competition, which may lead to tepid quarterly revenue growth. The company's slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition have weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season. Additionally, the strengthening U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates. These factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strategic collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate the Starlink satellite network into iPhones. This partnership not only diversifies Apple's satellite communications capability, adding value for customers by offering more reliable connectivity, but also showcases Apple's commitment to technological innovation. While the market reaction may initially be mixed due to competition with Globalstar, the long-term prospects for increased user engagement and potentially new revenue streams suggest positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
