(AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\n\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI technology, particularly the emergence of DeepSeek, which may threaten the cost structures of large AI investments among US companies like Apple. However, analysts suggest that Apple's focus on smaller, function-specific AI models places it in a less risky position compared to hyperscalers like Nvidia. This could lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock holding steady or rising despite the broader volatility in tech stocks. Consequently, there is a relatively balanced outlook with a slight tilt towards a price increase as Apple's risks appear lower than its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. While being viewed as 'safe assets' initially sounds positive, the professor argues that it leads to lower expected returns and excessive spending by these companies, including spending on each other. The reference to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests unsustainability. The news mentions a tech sell-off and concerns about AI competition (DeepSeek). While Apple is among the trusted companies, the overall message cautions against expecting high returns and signals potential future challenges. The market's immediate reaction (sell-off) suggests short-term negative sentiment. Considering this, the probability of a stock price fall in the short term is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%),  revenue growth is projected to be lower (3.7%), and the stock is currently rated a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Concerns exist regarding Apple's performance in China, although it's expected to show the first year-over-year positive change in several quarters.  The Services segment is expected to perform well.  The success of Apple Intelligence will significantly impact the stock's reaction. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, with the potential for positive movement depending heavily on the earnings report and subsequent commentary, particularly concerning iPhone sales and Apple Intelligence adoption. The downward trend so far this year (8% decrease) also weighs on the outlook.  Given the uncertainty and mixed signals, the probabilities are assigned to reflect a roughly even chance of the stock moving in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the consumer electronics market, driven by its innovative products and ecosystem, including the recent launch of Apple Intelligence. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which bodes well for Apple. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The positive sentiment from hedge funds and the potential for AI-driven growth suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise, though risks from competition and economic factors temper the outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the top stocks, and the content discusses the company's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, T-Mobile's (TMUS) fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, which may have a positive impact on the overall market sentiment. However, the news about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and its potential antitrust concerns does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. On the other hand, there are broader cautionary notes about market volatility and potential risks such as tariff implementations. Moreover, while Apple ranks highly on the list of best American stocks, analysts suggest that AI stocks might hold greater promise for higher returns.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news highlighted a significant development in AI technology with DeepSeek's innovative model, raising questions about the capital expenditures required for training large-scale AI models. This has generated concerns about overspending among major US tech companies, leading to market volatility and fears that could impact Apple's stock. Analysts seem to suggest that Apple's focus on function-specific AI models rather than large frontier models could position it favorably. This presents a scenario where Apple may face less risk relative to hyperscalers like Nvidia. Therefore, while there is a degree of caution stemming from general market reactions, the analysis points towards a more stable outlook for Apple, leading me to assign a slight tilt towards a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a somewhat negative outlook on the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple. The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor suggests an unsustainable cycle of spending among big tech firms, potentially leading to lower returns. While being viewed as a 'safe asset' might seem positive initially, the article argues it can lead to complacency and overspending. The DeepSeek AI news might fuel concerns about competition and potential market saturation. Reviewing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment with the median near 0.5 on both probabilities. Considering this I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While expected EPS growth is positive (8%), revenue growth is weaker (3.7%), and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  Concerns about China performance are tempered by a projected first year-over-year increase in sales.  Strong performance in services is anticipated, but the success of Apple Intelligence is crucial. The overall narrative suggests uncertainty. Previous model predictions are varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for the probability of a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the current Zacks rating, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the cautious sentiment and the potential for disappointment if Apple Intelligence underperforms or China sales remain weak. However, the possibility of positive surprise from the services sector and a better-than-expected reception of Apple Intelligence prevent a significantly higher probability for a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a leader in the consumer electronics market with strong growth potential driven by AI innovations like Apple Intelligence, a robust ecosystem, and a favorable position among hedge funds. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which benefits Apple, but economic uncertainties and potential tariff impacts add risks. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, along with the generally optimistic sentiment from analysts and hedge funds, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, the latest iOS 18.3 update supports Starlink features, which may further boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment may also be positively affected by T-Mobile's fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeding Wall Street expectations. Considering the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX and the potential for AI-driven growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to consider the mixed predictions from other models, which may indicate that they have additional information about the stock price. The trend of others' beliefs, as demonstrated in the previous rounds, suggests a slight tilt towards a price increase, but with varying degrees of confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. The company is also recognized as a top stock to hold in 2025 with a Buy rating maintained by Rosenblatt Securities, supporting optimistic growth prospects. On the other hand, concerns about slower iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands, and broader market volatility suggest potential risks. These factors collectively indicate a scenario with moderately higher positive sentiments but with underlying uncertainties.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
