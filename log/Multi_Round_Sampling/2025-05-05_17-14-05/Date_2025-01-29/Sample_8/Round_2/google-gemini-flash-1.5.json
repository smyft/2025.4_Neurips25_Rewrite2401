(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI technology, particularly the emergence of DeepSeek, which may threaten the cost structures of large AI investments among US companies like Apple. However, analysts suggest that Apple's focus on smaller, function-specific AI models places it in a less risky position compared to hyperscalers like Nvidia. This could lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock holding steady or rising despite the broader volatility in tech stocks. Consequently, there is a relatively balanced outlook with a slight tilt towards a price increase as Apple's risks appear lower than its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. While being viewed as 'safe assets' initially sounds positive, the professor argues that it leads to lower expected returns and excessive spending by these companies, including spending on each other. The reference to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests unsustainability. The news mentions a tech sell-off and concerns about AI competition (DeepSeek). While Apple is among the trusted companies, the overall message cautions against expecting high returns and signals potential future challenges. The market's immediate reaction (sell-off) suggests short-term negative sentiment. Considering this, the probability of a stock price fall in the short term is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%),  revenue growth is projected to be lower (3.7%), and the stock is currently rated a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Concerns exist regarding Apple's performance in China, although it's expected to show the first year-over-year positive change in several quarters.  The Services segment is expected to perform well.  The success of Apple Intelligence will significantly impact the stock's reaction. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, with the potential for positive movement depending heavily on the earnings report and subsequent commentary, particularly concerning iPhone sales and Apple Intelligence adoption. The downward trend so far this year (8% decrease) also weighs on the outlook.  Given the uncertainty and mixed signals, the probabilities are assigned to reflect a roughly even chance of the stock moving in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the consumer electronics market, driven by its innovative products and ecosystem, including the recent launch of Apple Intelligence. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which bodes well for Apple. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The positive sentiment from hedge funds and the potential for AI-driven growth suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise, though risks from competition and economic factors temper the outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the top stocks, and the content discusses the company's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, T-Mobile's (TMUS) fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, which may have a positive impact on the overall market sentiment. However, the news about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and its potential antitrust concerns does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. On the other hand, there are broader cautionary notes about market volatility and potential risks such as tariff implementations. Moreover, while Apple ranks highly on the list of best American stocks, analysts suggest that AI stocks might hold greater promise for higher returns.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news highlighted a significant development in AI technology with DeepSeek's innovative model, raising questions about the capital expenditures required for training large-scale AI models. This has generated concerns about overspending among major US tech companies, leading to market volatility and fears that could impact Apple's stock. Analysts seem to suggest that Apple's focus on function-specific AI models rather than large frontier models could position it favorably. This presents a scenario where Apple may face less risk relative to hyperscalers like Nvidia. Therefore, while there is a degree of caution stemming from general market reactions, the analysis points towards a more stable outlook for Apple, leading me to assign a slight tilt towards a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a somewhat negative outlook on the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple. The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor suggests an unsustainable cycle of spending among big tech firms, potentially leading to lower returns. While being viewed as a 'safe asset' might seem positive initially, the article argues it can lead to complacency and overspending. The DeepSeek AI news might fuel concerns about competition and potential market saturation. Reviewing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment with the median near 0.5 on both probabilities. Considering this I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While expected EPS growth is positive (8%), revenue growth is weaker (3.7%), and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  Concerns about China performance are tempered by a projected first year-over-year increase in sales.  Strong performance in services is anticipated, but the success of Apple Intelligence is crucial. The overall narrative suggests uncertainty. Previous model predictions are varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for the probability of a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the current Zacks rating, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the cautious sentiment and the potential for disappointment if Apple Intelligence underperforms or China sales remain weak. However, the possibility of positive surprise from the services sector and a better-than-expected reception of Apple Intelligence prevent a significantly higher probability for a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a leader in the consumer electronics market with strong growth potential driven by AI innovations like Apple Intelligence, a robust ecosystem, and a favorable position among hedge funds. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which benefits Apple, but economic uncertainties and potential tariff impacts add risks. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, along with the generally optimistic sentiment from analysts and hedge funds, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, the latest iOS 18.3 update supports Starlink features, which may further boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment may also be positively affected by T-Mobile's fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeding Wall Street expectations. Considering the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX and the potential for AI-driven growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to consider the mixed predictions from other models, which may indicate that they have additional information about the stock price. The trend of others' beliefs, as demonstrated in the previous rounds, suggests a slight tilt towards a price increase, but with varying degrees of confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. The company is also recognized as a top stock to hold in 2025 with a Buy rating maintained by Rosenblatt Securities, supporting optimistic growth prospects. On the other hand, concerns about slower iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands, and broader market volatility suggest potential risks. These factors collectively indicate a scenario with moderately higher positive sentiments but with underlying uncertainties.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
