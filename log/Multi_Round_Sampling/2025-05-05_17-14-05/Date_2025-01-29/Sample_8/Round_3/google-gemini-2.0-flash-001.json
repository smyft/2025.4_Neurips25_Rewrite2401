(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI technology, particularly the emergence of DeepSeek, which may threaten the cost structures of large AI investments among US companies like Apple. However, analysts suggest that Apple's focus on smaller, function-specific AI models places it in a less risky position compared to hyperscalers like Nvidia. This could lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock holding steady or rising despite the broader volatility in tech stocks. Consequently, there is a relatively balanced outlook with a slight tilt towards a price increase as Apple's risks appear lower than its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. While being viewed as 'safe assets' initially sounds positive, the professor argues that it leads to lower expected returns and excessive spending by these companies, including spending on each other. The reference to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests unsustainability. The news mentions a tech sell-off and concerns about AI competition (DeepSeek). While Apple is among the trusted companies, the overall message cautions against expecting high returns and signals potential future challenges. The market's immediate reaction (sell-off) suggests short-term negative sentiment. Considering this, the probability of a stock price fall in the short term is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%),  revenue growth is projected to be lower (3.7%), and the stock is currently rated a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Concerns exist regarding Apple's performance in China, although it's expected to show the first year-over-year positive change in several quarters.  The Services segment is expected to perform well.  The success of Apple Intelligence will significantly impact the stock's reaction. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, with the potential for positive movement depending heavily on the earnings report and subsequent commentary, particularly concerning iPhone sales and Apple Intelligence adoption. The downward trend so far this year (8% decrease) also weighs on the outlook.  Given the uncertainty and mixed signals, the probabilities are assigned to reflect a roughly even chance of the stock moving in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the consumer electronics market, driven by its innovative products and ecosystem, including the recent launch of Apple Intelligence. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which bodes well for Apple. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The positive sentiment from hedge funds and the potential for AI-driven growth suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise, though risks from competition and economic factors temper the outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the top stocks, and the content discusses the company's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, T-Mobile's (TMUS) fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, which may have a positive impact on the overall market sentiment. However, the news about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and its potential antitrust concerns does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. On the other hand, there are broader cautionary notes about market volatility and potential risks such as tariff implementations. Moreover, while Apple ranks highly on the list of best American stocks, analysts suggest that AI stocks might hold greater promise for higher returns.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news highlighted a significant development in AI technology with DeepSeek's innovative model, raising questions about the capital expenditures required for training large-scale AI models. This has generated concerns about overspending among major US tech companies, leading to market volatility and fears that could impact Apple's stock. Analysts seem to suggest that Apple's focus on function-specific AI models rather than large frontier models could position it favorably. This presents a scenario where Apple may face less risk relative to hyperscalers like Nvidia. Therefore, while there is a degree of caution stemming from general market reactions, the analysis points towards a more stable outlook for Apple, leading me to assign a slight tilt towards a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a somewhat negative outlook on the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple. The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor suggests an unsustainable cycle of spending among big tech firms, potentially leading to lower returns. While being viewed as a 'safe asset' might seem positive initially, the article argues it can lead to complacency and overspending. The DeepSeek AI news might fuel concerns about competition and potential market saturation. Reviewing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment with the median near 0.5 on both probabilities. Considering this I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While expected EPS growth is positive (8%), revenue growth is weaker (3.7%), and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  Concerns about China performance are tempered by a projected first year-over-year increase in sales.  Strong performance in services is anticipated, but the success of Apple Intelligence is crucial. The overall narrative suggests uncertainty. Previous model predictions are varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for the probability of a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the current Zacks rating, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the cautious sentiment and the potential for disappointment if Apple Intelligence underperforms or China sales remain weak. However, the possibility of positive surprise from the services sector and a better-than-expected reception of Apple Intelligence prevent a significantly higher probability for a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a leader in the consumer electronics market with strong growth potential driven by AI innovations like Apple Intelligence, a robust ecosystem, and a favorable position among hedge funds. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which benefits Apple, but economic uncertainties and potential tariff impacts add risks. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, along with the generally optimistic sentiment from analysts and hedge funds, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, the latest iOS 18.3 update supports Starlink features, which may further boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment may also be positively affected by T-Mobile's fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeding Wall Street expectations. Considering the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX and the potential for AI-driven growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to consider the mixed predictions from other models, which may indicate that they have additional information about the stock price. The trend of others' beliefs, as demonstrated in the previous rounds, suggests a slight tilt towards a price increase, but with varying degrees of confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. The company is also recognized as a top stock to hold in 2025 with a Buy rating maintained by Rosenblatt Securities, supporting optimistic growth prospects. On the other hand, concerns about slower iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands, and broader market volatility suggest potential risks. These factors collectively indicate a scenario with moderately higher positive sentiments but with underlying uncertainties.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news surrounding DeepSeek raises concerns about AI spending among major U.S. tech companies, including Apple. While analysts suggest that Apple's focus on smaller, on-device models positions it more favorably amidst fears of overinvestment, the broader market environment shows increased volatility. Previous predictions reflect mixed sentiments, with some reinforcing confidence in Apple's stability and growth potential, while others highlight underlying risks from competition and market saturation. The latest insights indicate a cautious optimism toward Apple, suggesting a slight probability of price rise due to its resilient market position and innovation efforts, while also acknowledging the potential for price fall amid market uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline and Mihir Desai's analysis, focusing on the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor, suggest potential downsides for the Magnificent Seven, including Apple. While these companies are perceived as safe assets, Desai argues this leads to lower expected returns and excessive spending, particularly on internal projects and each other. This creates an unsustainable loop potentially leading to lower future returns. The DeepSeek AI developments could intensify this pressure by necessitating further spending to maintain competitive advantages. The previous predictions show a shift towards slightly more bearish sentiment over time, factoring in these aspects. Given the somewhat more negative current analysis and the slight shift in prior predictions, I will adjust my assessment, but not drastically due to Apple's historically resilient performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While some positive aspects exist, such as expected EPS growth and strong performance in the Services segment, several factors point towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant negative indicator. Revenue growth is projected to be weak (3.7%), and concerns about China performance persist despite a projected year-over-year increase.  The success of Apple Intelligence is crucial and uncertain.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, but the overall trend leans slightly towards a price fall. Considering these factors and the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings reports, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price decrease. However, the possibility of a positive surprise from services and Apple Intelligence prevents assigning an overwhelmingly negative probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include its strong position in the growing consumer electronics market, driven by AI innovations like Apple Intelligence, a robust ecosystem, and a favorable stance among hedge funds. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges such as declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China introduce risks. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, benefiting Apple, but economic uncertainties and potential tariff impacts add downside risks. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, along with the generally optimistic sentiment from analysts and hedge funds, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
