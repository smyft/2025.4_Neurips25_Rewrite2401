(AAPL) the Best American Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nWill the Market Continue To Be Bullish in 2025?\n\nWall Street\u2019s outlook for the stock market in 2025 reflects a cautious optimism following two consecutive years of substantial gains. Analysts predict continued growth, however at a more moderate pace compared to the explosive increases of 2023 and 2024. According to a report by CNN, published on January 1, strategists anticipate a 14.8% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, which is significant but lower than the previous years\u2019 performances. The Index saw gains of approximately 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. As per the report 2025 marks a return to typical growth rates after an extraordinary period of high returns, which has not been seen since the late 1990s.\n\nWhile several factors are expected to contribute to the market growth, there are potential risks that can hinder it. One of the key factors contributing to growth is the anticipated business-friendly policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Dan Ives, who is a technology senior analyst at Wedbush Securities in his December 30 note mentioned his expectations that tech stocks can rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration. The analyst has picked Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks as his best performers for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential risks that could negatively impact the stock market. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy decisions may create a volatile environment for markets. Traders are particularly wary of how proposed tariffs could affect economic stability and investor confidence. David Sekera from Morningstar emphasizes that the implementation of tariffs is a significant wildcard that could sway market performance in either direction. We recently covered the analysis of Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company in our article titled, 12 High Growth International Stocks to Invest in Now. Here\u2019s a piece from our coverage:\n\n\u201cWhile talking about large-cap stock performance, Timmer raises the question of whether this trend of narrow leadership will persist. He suggested that trends continue to move in the same direction until a significant change occurs. Given that large-cap growth stocks have dominated for years, it is reasonable to assume that they may continue to lead. However, he also cautioned the investors that as per the concept of mean reversion, asset prices will eventually return to their historical averages and when this happens, it could lead to sharp corrections in stock prices. Timmer believes that while 2024 was a \u201cGoldilocks year,\u201d for earnings and valuations, this year can be a tussle between higher earnings and rising long-term interest rates, thereby resulting in a volatile market.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo get the list of the 10 best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. Using the database we ranked the top 10 American stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an international provider of smartphones, personal computers, and other technology gadgets. Based in America, the company is renowned for its iPhone, Mac, and iPad. On January 27, Rosenblatt Securities reiterated their Buy rating on the stock, keeping the price target of $262. The firm expects the ongoing December quarter to be a bit low due to slower sales of the iPhone as it continues to face challenges from other Chinese manufacturers.\n\nManagement has been proactive in dealing with this competition. They released Apple Intelligence in June last year. The new artificial intelligence will be integrated with upcoming models to enhance user experience and act as a competitive edge over its competitors. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also shifted its focus on the Apple Store and its services revenue stream. As a result, the company was able to generate a record $25 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of 2024, indicating a 12% increase year-over-year.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here\u2019s what it is said regarding the company in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI technology, particularly the emergence of DeepSeek, which may threaten the cost structures of large AI investments among US companies like Apple. However, analysts suggest that Apple's focus on smaller, function-specific AI models places it in a less risky position compared to hyperscalers like Nvidia. This could lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock holding steady or rising despite the broader volatility in tech stocks. Consequently, there is a relatively balanced outlook with a slight tilt towards a price increase as Apple's risks appear lower than its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. While being viewed as 'safe assets' initially sounds positive, the professor argues that it leads to lower expected returns and excessive spending by these companies, including spending on each other. The reference to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests unsustainability. The news mentions a tech sell-off and concerns about AI competition (DeepSeek). While Apple is among the trusted companies, the overall message cautions against expecting high returns and signals potential future challenges. The market's immediate reaction (sell-off) suggests short-term negative sentiment. Considering this, the probability of a stock price fall in the short term is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%),  revenue growth is projected to be lower (3.7%), and the stock is currently rated a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Concerns exist regarding Apple's performance in China, although it's expected to show the first year-over-year positive change in several quarters.  The Services segment is expected to perform well.  The success of Apple Intelligence will significantly impact the stock's reaction. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, with the potential for positive movement depending heavily on the earnings report and subsequent commentary, particularly concerning iPhone sales and Apple Intelligence adoption. The downward trend so far this year (8% decrease) also weighs on the outlook.  Given the uncertainty and mixed signals, the probabilities are assigned to reflect a roughly even chance of the stock moving in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the consumer electronics market, driven by its innovative products and ecosystem, including the recent launch of Apple Intelligence. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which bodes well for Apple. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The positive sentiment from hedge funds and the potential for AI-driven growth suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise, though risks from competition and economic factors temper the outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the top stocks, and the content discusses the company's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, T-Mobile's (TMUS) fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, which may have a positive impact on the overall market sentiment. However, the news about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and its potential antitrust concerns does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. On the other hand, there are broader cautionary notes about market volatility and potential risks such as tariff implementations. Moreover, while Apple ranks highly on the list of best American stocks, analysts suggest that AI stocks might hold greater promise for higher returns.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news highlighted a significant development in AI technology with DeepSeek's innovative model, raising questions about the capital expenditures required for training large-scale AI models. This has generated concerns about overspending among major US tech companies, leading to market volatility and fears that could impact Apple's stock. Analysts seem to suggest that Apple's focus on function-specific AI models rather than large frontier models could position it favorably. This presents a scenario where Apple may face less risk relative to hyperscalers like Nvidia. Therefore, while there is a degree of caution stemming from general market reactions, the analysis points towards a more stable outlook for Apple, leading me to assign a slight tilt towards a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a somewhat negative outlook on the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple. The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor suggests an unsustainable cycle of spending among big tech firms, potentially leading to lower returns. While being viewed as a 'safe asset' might seem positive initially, the article argues it can lead to complacency and overspending. The DeepSeek AI news might fuel concerns about competition and potential market saturation. Reviewing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment with the median near 0.5 on both probabilities. Considering this I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While expected EPS growth is positive (8%), revenue growth is weaker (3.7%), and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  Concerns about China performance are tempered by a projected first year-over-year increase in sales.  Strong performance in services is anticipated, but the success of Apple Intelligence is crucial. The overall narrative suggests uncertainty. Previous model predictions are varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for the probability of a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the current Zacks rating, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the cautious sentiment and the potential for disappointment if Apple Intelligence underperforms or China sales remain weak. However, the possibility of positive surprise from the services sector and a better-than-expected reception of Apple Intelligence prevent a significantly higher probability for a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a leader in the consumer electronics market with strong growth potential driven by AI innovations like Apple Intelligence, a robust ecosystem, and a favorable position among hedge funds. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which benefits Apple, but economic uncertainties and potential tariff impacts add risks. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, along with the generally optimistic sentiment from analysts and hedge funds, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, the latest iOS 18.3 update supports Starlink features, which may further boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment may also be positively affected by T-Mobile's fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeding Wall Street expectations. Considering the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX and the potential for AI-driven growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to consider the mixed predictions from other models, which may indicate that they have additional information about the stock price. The trend of others' beliefs, as demonstrated in the previous rounds, suggests a slight tilt towards a price increase, but with varying degrees of confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. The company is also recognized as a top stock to hold in 2025 with a Buy rating maintained by Rosenblatt Securities, supporting optimistic growth prospects. On the other hand, concerns about slower iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands, and broader market volatility suggest potential risks. These factors collectively indicate a scenario with moderately higher positive sentiments but with underlying uncertainties.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news surrounding DeepSeek raises concerns about AI spending among major U.S. tech companies, including Apple. While analysts suggest that Apple's focus on smaller, on-device models positions it more favorably amidst fears of overinvestment, the broader market environment shows increased volatility. Previous predictions reflect mixed sentiments, with some reinforcing confidence in Apple's stability and growth potential, while others highlight underlying risks from competition and market saturation. The latest insights indicate a cautious optimism toward Apple, suggesting a slight probability of price rise due to its resilient market position and innovation efforts, while also acknowledging the potential for price fall amid market uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline and Mihir Desai's analysis, focusing on the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor, suggest potential downsides for the Magnificent Seven, including Apple. While these companies are perceived as safe assets, Desai argues this leads to lower expected returns and excessive spending, particularly on internal projects and each other. This creates an unsustainable loop potentially leading to lower future returns. The DeepSeek AI developments could intensify this pressure by necessitating further spending to maintain competitive advantages. The previous predictions show a shift towards slightly more bearish sentiment over time, factoring in these aspects. Given the somewhat more negative current analysis and the slight shift in prior predictions, I will adjust my assessment, but not drastically due to Apple's historically resilient performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While some positive aspects exist, such as expected EPS growth and strong performance in the Services segment, several factors point towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant negative indicator. Revenue growth is projected to be weak (3.7%), and concerns about China performance persist despite a projected year-over-year increase.  The success of Apple Intelligence is crucial and uncertain.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, but the overall trend leans slightly towards a price fall. Considering these factors and the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings reports, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price decrease. However, the possibility of a positive surprise from services and Apple Intelligence prevents assigning an overwhelmingly negative probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include its strong position in the growing consumer electronics market, driven by AI innovations like Apple Intelligence, a robust ecosystem, and a favorable stance among hedge funds. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges such as declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China introduce risks. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, benefiting Apple, but economic uncertainties and potential tariff impacts add downside risks. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, along with the generally optimistic sentiment from analysts and hedge funds, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development. Additionally, the latest iOS 18.3 update supports Starlink features, which may further boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment may also be positively affected by T-Mobile's fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeding Wall Street expectations. Considering the positive news and the potential for AI-driven growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the mixed predictions from other models and the trend of others' beliefs suggest a moderate level of confidence in this prediction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. The company is also recognized as a top stock to hold in 2025 with a Buy rating maintained by Rosenblatt Securities, supporting optimistic growth prospects. On the other hand, concerns about slower iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands, and broader market volatility suggest potential risks. These factors collectively indicate a scenario with moderately higher positive sentiments but with underlying uncertainties.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The financial news discusses significant shifts in the AI landscape due to DeepSeek's recent developments, which raise concerns about spending in the tech sector and competition. While many analysts express caution, suggesting that Apple's approach of focusing on smaller, function-specific AI models may reduce its risk compared to larger tech companies heavily investing in AI, concerns about overall market volatility and competition from rivals remain. Given that some predictions lean slightly towards a price rise due to Apple's lower capital expenditure needs and its strong consumer electronics position, I estimate a modest probability of the stock price rising. However, the mixed sentiments and potential negative market reaction result in a slightly higher probability of price decline based on cautious investor sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a potential problem with the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple. The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor implies an unsustainable economic model due to excessive intra-group spending and potentially lower returns. While Apple is perceived as a safe asset, the analysis indicates this might not translate into high returns, and the need to spend to keep up with AI innovation spurred by companies like DeepSeek puts more pressure on Apple's financial outlook. Analyzing prior predictions, there is a slight trend toward decreased possibility of price increase. Considering these factors, I slightly adjust my prediction to reflect a higher likelihood of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While modest EPS growth is projected, revenue growth is weaker, and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating signals analyst bearishness.  Concerns remain about China performance, although a projected year-over-year sales increase offers some optimism. The Services segment is expected to perform well, while the success of Apple Intelligence is crucial and uncertain.  Previous model predictions show wide variation, with no clear consensus. The overall trend leans slightly towards a price fall, reflecting the cautious sentiment and potential for disappointment. However, the possibility of positive surprises from services and Apple Intelligence prevents assigning an overwhelmingly negative probability.  Considering the mixed signals, the relatively low projected revenue growth, and the Zacks Sell rating, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise. The historical performance of Apple, coupled with its strong brand recognition and diversified product portfolio mitigate a much stronger downward leaning prediction.   The lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative information in the news leads to a relatively balanced prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include its strong position in the growing consumer electronics market, driven by AI innovations like Apple Intelligence, a robust ecosystem, and a favorable stance among hedge funds. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges such as declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China introduce risks. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, benefiting Apple, but economic uncertainties and potential tariff impacts add downside risks.

Additionally, the latest iOS 18.3 update supports Starlink features, which may further boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment may also be positively affected by T-Mobile's fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeding Wall Street expectations.
