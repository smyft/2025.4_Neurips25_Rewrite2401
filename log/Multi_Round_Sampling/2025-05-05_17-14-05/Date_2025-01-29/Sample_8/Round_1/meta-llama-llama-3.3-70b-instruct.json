A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI technology, particularly the emergence of DeepSeek, which may threaten the cost structures of large AI investments among US companies like Apple. However, analysts suggest that Apple's focus on smaller, function-specific AI models places it in a less risky position compared to hyperscalers like Nvidia. This could lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock holding steady or rising despite the broader volatility in tech stocks. Consequently, there is a relatively balanced outlook with a slight tilt towards a price increase as Apple's risks appear lower than its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. While being viewed as 'safe assets' initially sounds positive, the professor argues that it leads to lower expected returns and excessive spending by these companies, including spending on each other. The reference to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests unsustainability. The news mentions a tech sell-off and concerns about AI competition (DeepSeek). While Apple is among the trusted companies, the overall message cautions against expecting high returns and signals potential future challenges. The market's immediate reaction (sell-off) suggests short-term negative sentiment. Considering this, the probability of a stock price fall in the short term is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%),  revenue growth is projected to be lower (3.7%), and the stock is currently rated a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Concerns exist regarding Apple's performance in China, although it's expected to show the first year-over-year positive change in several quarters.  The Services segment is expected to perform well.  The success of Apple Intelligence will significantly impact the stock's reaction. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, with the potential for positive movement depending heavily on the earnings report and subsequent commentary, particularly concerning iPhone sales and Apple Intelligence adoption. The downward trend so far this year (8% decrease) also weighs on the outlook.  Given the uncertainty and mixed signals, the probabilities are assigned to reflect a roughly even chance of the stock moving in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the consumer electronics market, driven by its innovative products and ecosystem, including the recent launch of Apple Intelligence. The global consumer electronics market is projected to grow significantly, which bodes well for Apple. Analysts maintain a Buy rating with a target price of $262, indicating optimism. However, challenges include declining iPhone sales growth, competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. The positive sentiment from hedge funds and the potential for AI-driven growth suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise, though risks from competition and economic factors temper the outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the top stocks, and the content discusses the company's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, T-Mobile's (TMUS) fiscal fourth quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, which may have a positive impact on the overall market sentiment. However, the news about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and its potential antitrust concerns does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the positive news about Apple's collaboration with SpaceX, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong presence among hedge funds and shows positive movements with AI integration and service diversification. On the other hand, there are broader cautionary notes about market volatility and potential risks such as tariff implementations. Moreover, while Apple ranks highly on the list of best American stocks, analysts suggest that AI stocks might hold greater promise for higher returns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
