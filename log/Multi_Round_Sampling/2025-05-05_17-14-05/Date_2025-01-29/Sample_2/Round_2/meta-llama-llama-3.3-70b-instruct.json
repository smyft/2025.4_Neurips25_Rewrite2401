(AAPL): \u2018We Have The Most Widely Anticipated Disappointment That I\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer may lead to negative sentiment around Apple's stock, especially ahead of earnings where expectations can be critical. The mention of competition in China and a lack of innovative AI features suggests potential challenges to growth. Consequently, these factors could result in a higher likelihood of the stock price falling as investors may reassess their positions before the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removal of the price target signal a lack of confidence. Concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market (citing specific data), heightened competition, and the absence of compelling AI features are all bearish indicators. Lowered revenue and EPS forecasts further reinforce the negative sentiment. While the current dip is small ('down a fraction'), this is pre-earnings. The upcoming earnings release will be critical. Given the issues raised, the probability of a negative reaction (stock price fall) is higher, especially if the earnings report confirms or worsens these concerns. I've slightly weighted the fall as more likely, as these are forward-looking concerns and guidance will play a large role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative sentiment towards Apple's stock. Multiple downgrades from various analysts cite concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  The lack of compelling AI applications is also highlighted as a factor hindering near-term growth. While the stock experienced a recent rally possibly due to unrelated positive news (DeepSeek's emergence), the negative sentiment surrounding iPhone sales and the impending earnings report significantly outweigh this. The fact that Apple is considered the 'least-loved megacap' except Tesla further suggests a bearish outlook. Although the probability of a price rise isn't entirely zero given the possibility of a positive earnings surprise or market-wide factors, the preponderance of evidence suggests a higher likelihood of a price drop. The upcoming earnings report acts as a significant catalyst that could either mitigate or exacerbate the current negative sentiment. The pre-earnings sell-off is also a major indicator. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is assigned a significantly higher weight.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones through the latest iOS 18.3 update, which supports Starlink features across images, music, and podcasts. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product ecosystem and could drive increased user engagement and potential revenue from services. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this report. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance may be self-perpetuating but ultimately lead to low returns. Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai compares this phenomenon to a 'snake eating its own tail,' suggesting that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to low expected returns. This comparison implies that while the companies may continue to thrive in the short term due to their perceived safety and continued investment in each other, their growth potential is limited. As a result, the news may have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, as it suggests that the company's growth may be capped by its own self-reinforcing market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL) on Mad Money, where he warned of a widely anticipated disappointment in the company's upcoming earnings report. He mentioned potential issues such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a possible radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year. However, he also emphasized that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and advised investors to hold onto the stock rather than trying to trade it. Given this mixed assessment, the probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on how the market reacts to the actual earnings report and the company's future prospects. Since Cramer's warning suggests potential negative surprises, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher, but his long-term positive stance on the company tempers this outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s position in the growing consumer electronics market, emphasizing its strong brand, ecosystem, and AI advancements. Despite concerns over iPhone sales slowdown and competition from Chinese brands, the report indicates potential growth from services and AI-integrated products, maintaining a positive outlook from analysts. The stock is also noted to be favored by hedge funds, suggesting strong investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' indicates a lack of confidence in Apple's stock, especially with concerns about competition in China and limited AI features. This bearish sentiment is compounded by a pre-earnings backdrop, where investor caution typically increases. Previous analyses highlight a trend toward negative sentiment ahead of Apple's earnings report, exacerbating fears of disappointing results related to weak iPhone sales and competition. Given these factors, a higher probability of a stock price decline is justified, despite some analysts offering slightly positive perspectives. The overall consensus leans toward bearish outcomes, leading to an estimated probability of 0.75 for falling and 0.25 for rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is significantly negative, stemming from Oppenheimer's downgrade and concerns about slowing iPhone sales, especially in the crucial Chinese market. The absence of compelling AI applications is another bearish signal. While the stock was only down a fraction, this was before the earnings report. Given these headwinds and lowered forecasts, the likelihood of a negative reaction (stock price decrease) post-earnings is high. Reviewing previous round predictions, earlier estimations leaned heavily towards a price fall, and the consistency of these concerns reinforces the bearish outlook ahead of the Q1 earnings report. While some models in Round 0 gave higher probabilities for a price rise, these were typically based on separate, positive news events or factors not directly related to the core concerns highlighted in this specific article. Also considering the fact that other analysts may have certain positive or negative information about the company but is not exposed in this news, I will put the probability accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative, with multiple analyst downgrades citing concerns about slowing iPhone sales, especially in China, and a lack of compelling AI-related features.  While there was a recent short-term rally possibly due to unrelated positive news, the pre-earnings sell-off and widespread bearish sentiment significantly outweigh this. The upcoming earnings report is a critical catalyst, but the current indicators strongly suggest a higher likelihood of a price drop. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a higher probability of a price fall. The weight of negative news coupled with the pre-earnings jitters makes a price increase less likely.  Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability of a price fall, considering the confluence of negative factors and the uncertain impact of the earnings report. The DeepSeek mention is a minor positive, but does not outweight the significant negative factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones through the iOS 18.3 update, which supports Starlink features across images, music, and podcasts. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product ecosystem and could drive increased user engagement and potential revenue from services. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this report. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall. However, considering previous rounds of predictions which indicated mixed sentiment and some concerns about competition and sales, the probability of a rise is tempered slightly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and their market dominance. The comparison of this phenomenon to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests that while these companies are viewed as safe assets, their growth potential is limited, leading to expected low returns. This analysis implies a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a mixed outlook but with a slight inclination towards a negative impact due to limited growth potential and concerns about earnings reports. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), warning of a widely anticipated disappointment in the company's upcoming earnings report. He mentions potential issues such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a possible radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year. However, he also emphasizes that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and advises investors to hold onto the stock rather than trying to trade it. Considering Cramer's mixed assessment and the overall market uncertainty due to the Federal Reserve's decision and earnings season, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher. But given Apple's strong brand, ecosystem, and the potential for long-term growth, the probability of the stock price rising is still significant. The previous predictions from other models show a varied range of opinions, with some assigning a higher probability to a price fall due to negative sentiment and others predicting a rise due to the company's strengths and potential for positive earnings surprises. Taking into account the mixed signals and the balance of potential positive and negative factors, the estimated probabilities are assigned accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in the growing consumer electronics market, emphasizing its strong brand, ecosystem, and advancements in AI integration through Apple Intelligence. Despite concerns over iPhone sales slowdown and competition from Chinese brands, the report suggests potential growth from services and AI-integrated products. Hedge funds\u2019 positive stance on Apple Inc. also signals strong investor confidence. Although there are concerns about geopolitical factors like tariffs and competition, the bullish outlook from Rosenblatt Securities and Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy indicates a mix of positive sentiments offsetting some of the negatives.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
