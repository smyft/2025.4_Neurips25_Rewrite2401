(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer may lead to negative sentiment around Apple's stock, especially ahead of earnings where expectations can be critical. The mention of competition in China and a lack of innovative AI features suggests potential challenges to growth. Consequently, these factors could result in a higher likelihood of the stock price falling as investors may reassess their positions before the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removal of the price target signal a lack of confidence. Concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market (citing specific data), heightened competition, and the absence of compelling AI features are all bearish indicators. Lowered revenue and EPS forecasts further reinforce the negative sentiment. While the current dip is small ('down a fraction'), this is pre-earnings. The upcoming earnings release will be critical. Given the issues raised, the probability of a negative reaction (stock price fall) is higher, especially if the earnings report confirms or worsens these concerns. I've slightly weighted the fall as more likely, as these are forward-looking concerns and guidance will play a large role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative sentiment towards Apple's stock. Multiple downgrades from various analysts cite concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  The lack of compelling AI applications is also highlighted as a factor hindering near-term growth. While the stock experienced a recent rally possibly due to unrelated positive news (DeepSeek's emergence), the negative sentiment surrounding iPhone sales and the impending earnings report significantly outweigh this. The fact that Apple is considered the 'least-loved megacap' except Tesla further suggests a bearish outlook. Although the probability of a price rise isn't entirely zero given the possibility of a positive earnings surprise or market-wide factors, the preponderance of evidence suggests a higher likelihood of a price drop. The upcoming earnings report acts as a significant catalyst that could either mitigate or exacerbate the current negative sentiment. The pre-earnings sell-off is also a major indicator. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is assigned a significantly higher weight.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones through the latest iOS 18.3 update, which supports Starlink features across images, music, and podcasts. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product ecosystem and could drive increased user engagement and potential revenue from services. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this report. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance may be self-perpetuating but ultimately lead to low returns. Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai compares this phenomenon to a 'snake eating its own tail,' suggesting that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to low expected returns. This comparison implies that while the companies may continue to thrive in the short term due to their perceived safety and continued investment in each other, their growth potential is limited. As a result, the news may have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, as it suggests that the company's growth may be capped by its own self-reinforcing market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL) on Mad Money, where he warned of a widely anticipated disappointment in the company's upcoming earnings report. He mentioned potential issues such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a possible radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year. However, he also emphasized that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and advised investors to hold onto the stock rather than trying to trade it. Given this mixed assessment, the probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on how the market reacts to the actual earnings report and the company's future prospects. Since Cramer's warning suggests potential negative surprises, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher, but his long-term positive stance on the company tempers this outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s position in the growing consumer electronics market, emphasizing its strong brand, ecosystem, and AI advancements. Despite concerns over iPhone sales slowdown and competition from Chinese brands, the report indicates potential growth from services and AI-integrated products, maintaining a positive outlook from analysts. The stock is also noted to be favored by hedge funds, suggesting strong investor confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
