      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer on Slower iPhone Sales, China Market Pressures\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financials) was downgraded to Perform from Outperform by Oppenheimer ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, with analysts citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.\n\nPointing to a reduced iPhone sales forecast over the next 12 to 18 months, the investment group also eliminated its $250 price estimate on the shares. Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall sentiment in the market appears cautiously optimistic around major tech earnings, particularly with the Nasdaq and S&P futures rising. Investors seem to be recovering from previous concerns linked to a low-cost AI model from a Chinese start-up. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7', which has historically driven significant market gains, despite recent fluctuations. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates, which may alleviate some market pressures. Despite some uncertainty surrounding AI investments, the general sentiment around tech earnings is more positive. This context suggests a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and does not contain any significantly impactful information regarding Apple (AAPL) other than Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" Rating and anticipating AI benefits driving future growth. This is a moderate positive indicator; however, the analysis on Reddit is far more extensive. The overall impact on Apple is limited since it only references the opinion from Evercore ISI that Apple's artificial intelligence investment provides future value. Unless investors specifically look into Evercore ISI and analyze their historical reliability, price projections are only opinions and will thus likely have a very moderate impact on the change in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with concerns about slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China, paints a negative picture for the short-term outlook.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further solidify this bearish sentiment. While Wall Street's expectations for Q1 earnings are still relatively high, the negative news preceding the earnings release increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction, especially if the actual results fall short of expectations or the company's guidance is weak. The mention of increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications adds further weight to the negative outlook. The expected slowing iPhone replacement cycle also contributes to a less optimistic projection for future growth.  However, Apple is a large and established company, and a single downgrade doesn't automatically guarantee a significant and sustained price drop. The probabilities are weighted more heavily toward a price decrease given the current context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates. The downgrade and negative outlook are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the mention of delayed iPhone replacement cycles and lack of compelling AI apps further adds to the bearish case. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about Apple Inc. (AAPL) characterizes the company's upcoming earnings report as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen.' He lists several potential negative factors, including horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year. However, despite these concerns, Cramer advises investors to hold onto the stock rather than trade it, citing Apple's exceptional management and product quality. Given the mixed nature of Cramer's comments, which highlight both potential negative factors and the company's strengths, the stock price movement is uncertain. However, the emphasis on potential disappointment and negative factors slightly outweighs the positive remarks, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on the stock market. The article also mentions the recent downturn in the market caused by the emergence of a new Chinese AI model, but notes that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures have ticked up. Additionally, the strong results from ASML, a key supplier of computer chip-making equipment, have helped to buoy sentiment. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling, as the company's upcoming earnings report and the overall market sentiment may lead to a positive movement in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven'Big Tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as a safe asset amidst market uncertainty. According to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, while this perception leads to increased investment, it also results in low expected returns due to high expenses within these companies. The news suggests a cautious outlook for investors, anticipating potentially suboptimal performance. This information might lead to temporary selling pressures but doesn't fundamentally alter long-term investor sentiments towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The current financial news indicates a cautiously optimistic sentiment in the market, particularly as Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are ticking up and recovering from earlier losses. The focus on upcoming earnings reports from major tech players, including Apple, seems to inspire confidence despite recent concerns regarding a low-cost AI model from a Chinese company. While there are some negative indicators from analysts and prior downgrades related to Apple, the overall market sentiment may be supported by positive results from other tech companies like ASML. In light of the upcoming earnings report and the overall stabilization in tech stocks, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT), with the only direct mention of Apple (AAPL) being Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating and expecting AI to drive future growth. This is a mildly positive signal, but the lack of specific details or catalysts directly related to Apple makes a significant price movement unlikely. The previous rounds show varied sentiment. The early predictions were based on overall tech sentiment, some focusing on downgrades. The more recent models considered the Reddit news and gave higher probabilities for price decreases recognizing negative sentiment outweighed positive remarks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative.  Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with significant declines in Chinese iPhone shipments and concerns about slowing replacement cycles and lackluster AI integration, points to a substantial risk of a price drop. While Apple's Q1 earnings are anticipated to be strong,  the pre-earnings negative sentiment significantly increases the chance of a negative reaction, even if the earnings meet expectations.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with several models leaning towards a price fall. Considering the current information and the history of previous predictions, a price fall is more likely than a price rise in the short term.  The probabilities are weighted more heavily toward a price decrease due the significant negative factors highlighted in the news and the subsequent downgrade.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant downgrade of Apple by Oppenheimer, citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates. The downgrade and negative outlook are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the mention of delayed iPhone replacement cycles and lack of compelling AI apps further adds to the bearish case. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided focus on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple's upcoming earnings report being 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen.' Cramer lists several potential negative factors, including poor Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a significant cut to the forecast for the rest of the year. However, despite these concerns, Cramer advises investors to hold onto the stock rather than trade it, citing Apple's exceptional management and product quality. Considering these mixed comments and the overall cautious sentiment around major tech earnings, the probabilities are slightly weighted towards a potential stock price fall. The predictions from various models in previous rounds also indicate a cautious outlook, with several models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on the stock market. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures have ticked up, and the strong results from ASML, a key supplier of computer chip-making equipment, have helped to buoy sentiment. However, there are also concerns about the impact of a new Chinese AI model on Big Tech spending and the potential for disappointing earnings reports. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, as the company's upcoming earnings report and the overall market sentiment may lead to a positive movement in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven'Big Tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as a safe asset amidst market uncertainty. According to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, while this perception leads to increased investment, it also results in low expected returns due to high expenses within these companies. The news suggests a cautious outlook for investors, anticipating potentially suboptimal performance. This information might lead to temporary selling pressures but doesn't fundamentally alter long-term investor sentiments towards Apple. The previous predictions show mixed signals with a range from high confidence in a price increase to high confidence in a price decrease. The current news aligns more with a cautious and pessimistic outlook, but not extreme bearishness.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a mix of cautious optimism and concerns surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings and external pressures, particularly stemming from competitive dynamics and market sentiments related to AI. While the Nasdaq and S&P futures show a slight recovery, there are notable downgrades and worries about sales, especially in China, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the strong recent performance of ASML and impending tech earnings could provide some support. Based on this mixed sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of a price decrease due to the prevailing concerns about competition and lower expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT), with a brief mention of Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL) and anticipating AI benefits driving future growth. While this is a positive indicator, it's quite limited in scope and lacks specific catalysts directly related to Apple. The previous rounds of predictions showcase varied sentiments, ranging from cautious optimism to bearish outlooks, largely influenced by factors external to this particular news snippet (e.g., overall tech market sentiment, analyst downgrades). However, considering that the primary focus is on Reddit and any Apple-specific information being generic, the change in Apple's stock is not expected to be significant. I am weighting toward negligibly upward movement due to the Outperform rating provided. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative, focusing on Oppenheimer's downgrade due to slowing iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of compelling AI applications.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further reinforce this bearish sentiment. While the upcoming earnings report might offer a counterpoint, the pre-existing negative sentiment significantly increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction, even if the earnings meet expectations.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions but a clear trend toward a higher probability of a price fall in the later rounds, supporting my conclusion.  While Apple is a large and established company, the confluence of factors\u2014downgrade, slowing sales, China weakness, and AI concerns\u2014weigh heavily against a significant price increase in the short term. The strength of these negative indicators outweighs any potential positive influence from the upcoming earnings report or broader market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant downgrade of Apple by Oppenheimer, citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates. The downgrade and negative outlook are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the mention of delayed iPhone replacement cycles and lack of compelling AI apps further adds to the bearish case. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. Previous predictions also show a leaning towards a price fall, with several models predicting higher probabilities for a decrease.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided focus on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple's upcoming earnings report being 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen.'

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures have ticked up, and the strong results from ASML, a key supplier of computer chip-making equipment, have helped to buoy sentiment. However, there are also concerns about the impact of a new Chinese AI model on Big Tech spending and the potential for disappointing earnings reports. Considering the mixed signals from various models in previous rounds, the current news aligns more with a cautious outlook. The fact that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and has historically driven significant market gains, combined with the overall market stabilization, suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven'Big Tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as a safe asset amidst market uncertainty. According to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, while this perception leads to increased investment, it also results in low expected returns due to high expenses within these companies. The news suggests a cautious outlook for investors, anticipating potentially suboptimal performance. Previous predictions also show a mixed sentiment with varying degrees of optimism and pessimism regarding the company's stock price. Considering the current cautious outlook and the emphasis on low expected returns and increased expenses, the overall sentiment leans towards a slight possibility of a decline or stable performance.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news reflects a mix of cautious optimism and concerns surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are stabilizing and showing a slight recovery, there are significant worries stemming from the downgrade by Oppenheimer, indicating slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. This negative outlook is compounded by potential disappointing earnings reports influenced by earlier market turmoil. Although ASML's strong performance provides some support to tech sentiment, the prevailing negative signals suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term, despite some mixed indications of support from broader market performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Reddit (RDDT), but includes the information that Evercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL), expecting AI benefits to drive growth. However, the article primarily discusses Reddit's growth potential and past performance, and how investment banks view RDDT future performance. The consensus from previous rounds is trending slightly towards bearish, but this article provide positive sentiment with the Outperform rating and future prediction. Given most of the contents are on RDDT, I discount the impacts of the maintain an \"Outperform\" rating towards AAPL. Hence the impacts are not expected to be significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative, focusing on Oppenheimer's downgrade due to slowing iPhone sales, especially in the crucial Chinese market, and a perceived lack of compelling AI applications. This negative analyst sentiment is a significant factor.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further reinforce the bearish outlook. While the upcoming Q1 earnings report could potentially offer a contrasting narrative, the existing negative sentiment significantly increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction, even if the results meet expectations.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions, but a clear trend emerges in later rounds towards a higher probability of a price fall, supporting the bearish outlook.  Apple's size and established position offer some resilience against a catastrophic drop, but the confluence of negative factors \u2013 downgrade, weakening sales, China weakness, and AI concerns \u2013 strongly suggests a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term.  The strength of these negative indicators outweighs any potential positive influence from the upcoming earnings report or broader market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates. The downgrade and negative outlook are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment.

Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. Previous predictions also show a leaning towards a price fall, with several models predicting higher probabilities for a decrease. While there may be some optimism around the upcoming earnings report, the overwhelming negative sentiment from the downgrade and market pressures suggests a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple's upcoming earnings report being 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen.'
