(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further solidify this bearish sentiment. While Wall Street's expectations for Q1 earnings are still relatively high, the negative news preceding the earnings release increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction, especially if the actual results fall short of expectations or the company's guidance is weak. The mention of increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications adds further weight to the negative outlook. The expected slowing iPhone replacement cycle also contributes to a less optimistic projection for future growth.  However, Apple is a large and established company, and a single downgrade doesn't automatically guarantee a significant and sustained price drop. The probabilities are weighted more heavily toward a price decrease given the current context.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.25,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.75\n}\n```\n"
