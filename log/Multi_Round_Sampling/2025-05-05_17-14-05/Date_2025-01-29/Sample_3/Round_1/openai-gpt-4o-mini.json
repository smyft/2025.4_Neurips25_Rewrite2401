      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall sentiment in the market appears cautiously optimistic around major tech earnings, particularly with the Nasdaq and S&P futures rising. Investors seem to be recovering from previous concerns linked to a low-cost AI model from a Chinese start-up. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7', which has historically driven significant market gains, despite recent fluctuations. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates, which may alleviate some market pressures. Despite some uncertainty surrounding AI investments, the general sentiment around tech earnings is more positive. This context suggests a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and does not contain any significantly impactful information regarding Apple (AAPL) other than Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" Rating and anticipating AI benefits driving future growth. This is a moderate positive indicator; however, the analysis on Reddit is far more extensive. The overall impact on Apple is limited since it only references the opinion from Evercore ISI that Apple's artificial intelligence investment provides future value. Unless investors specifically look into Evercore ISI and analyze their historical reliability, price projections are only opinions and will thus likely have a very moderate impact on the change in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with concerns about slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China, paints a negative picture for the short-term outlook.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further solidify this bearish sentiment. While Wall Street's expectations for Q1 earnings are still relatively high, the negative news preceding the earnings release increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction, especially if the actual results fall short of expectations or the company's guidance is weak. The mention of increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications adds further weight to the negative outlook. The expected slowing iPhone replacement cycle also contributes to a less optimistic projection for future growth.  However, Apple is a large and established company, and a single downgrade doesn't automatically guarantee a significant and sustained price drop. The probabilities are weighted more heavily toward a price decrease given the current context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates. The downgrade and negative outlook are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the mention of delayed iPhone replacement cycles and lack of compelling AI apps further adds to the bearish case. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about Apple Inc. (AAPL) characterizes the company's upcoming earnings report as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen.' He lists several potential negative factors, including horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year. However, despite these concerns, Cramer advises investors to hold onto the stock rather than trade it, citing Apple's exceptional management and product quality. Given the mixed nature of Cramer's comments, which highlight both potential negative factors and the company's strengths, the stock price movement is uncertain. However, the emphasis on potential disappointment and negative factors slightly outweighs the positive remarks, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on the stock market. The article also mentions the recent downturn in the market caused by the emergence of a new Chinese AI model, but notes that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures have ticked up. Additionally, the strong results from ASML, a key supplier of computer chip-making equipment, have helped to buoy sentiment. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling, as the company's upcoming earnings report and the overall market sentiment may lead to a positive movement in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven'Big Tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as a safe asset amidst market uncertainty. According to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, while this perception leads to increased investment, it also results in low expected returns due to high expenses within these companies. The news suggests a cautious outlook for investors, anticipating potentially suboptimal performance. This information might lead to temporary selling pressures but doesn't fundamentally alter long-term investor sentiments towards Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
