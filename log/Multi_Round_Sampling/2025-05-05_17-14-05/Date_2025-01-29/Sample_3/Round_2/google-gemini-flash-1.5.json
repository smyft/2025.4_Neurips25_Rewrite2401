(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall sentiment in the market appears cautiously optimistic around major tech earnings, particularly with the Nasdaq and S&P futures rising. Investors seem to be recovering from previous concerns linked to a low-cost AI model from a Chinese start-up. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7', which has historically driven significant market gains, despite recent fluctuations. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates, which may alleviate some market pressures. Despite some uncertainty surrounding AI investments, the general sentiment around tech earnings is more positive. This context suggests a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and does not contain any significantly impactful information regarding Apple (AAPL) other than Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" Rating and anticipating AI benefits driving future growth. This is a moderate positive indicator; however, the analysis on Reddit is far more extensive. The overall impact on Apple is limited since it only references the opinion from Evercore ISI that Apple's artificial intelligence investment provides future value. Unless investors specifically look into Evercore ISI and analyze their historical reliability, price projections are only opinions and will thus likely have a very moderate impact on the change in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with concerns about slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China, paints a negative picture for the short-term outlook.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further solidify this bearish sentiment. While Wall Street's expectations for Q1 earnings are still relatively high, the negative news preceding the earnings release increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction, especially if the actual results fall short of expectations or the company's guidance is weak. The mention of increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications adds further weight to the negative outlook. The expected slowing iPhone replacement cycle also contributes to a less optimistic projection for future growth.  However, Apple is a large and established company, and a single downgrade doesn't automatically guarantee a significant and sustained price drop. The probabilities are weighted more heavily toward a price decrease given the current context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates. The downgrade and negative outlook are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the mention of delayed iPhone replacement cycles and lack of compelling AI apps further adds to the bearish case. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about Apple Inc. (AAPL) characterizes the company's upcoming earnings report as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen.' He lists several potential negative factors, including horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year. However, despite these concerns, Cramer advises investors to hold onto the stock rather than trade it, citing Apple's exceptional management and product quality. Given the mixed nature of Cramer's comments, which highlight both potential negative factors and the company's strengths, the stock price movement is uncertain. However, the emphasis on potential disappointment and negative factors slightly outweighs the positive remarks, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on the stock market. The article also mentions the recent downturn in the market caused by the emergence of a new Chinese AI model, but notes that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures have ticked up. Additionally, the strong results from ASML, a key supplier of computer chip-making equipment, have helped to buoy sentiment. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling, as the company's upcoming earnings report and the overall market sentiment may lead to a positive movement in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven'Big Tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as a safe asset amidst market uncertainty. According to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, while this perception leads to increased investment, it also results in low expected returns due to high expenses within these companies. The news suggests a cautious outlook for investors, anticipating potentially suboptimal performance. This information might lead to temporary selling pressures but doesn't fundamentally alter long-term investor sentiments towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The current financial news indicates a cautiously optimistic sentiment in the market, particularly as Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are ticking up and recovering from earlier losses. The focus on upcoming earnings reports from major tech players, including Apple, seems to inspire confidence despite recent concerns regarding a low-cost AI model from a Chinese company. While there are some negative indicators from analysts and prior downgrades related to Apple, the overall market sentiment may be supported by positive results from other tech companies like ASML. In light of the upcoming earnings report and the overall stabilization in tech stocks, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT), with the only direct mention of Apple (AAPL) being Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating and expecting AI to drive future growth. This is a mildly positive signal, but the lack of specific details or catalysts directly related to Apple makes a significant price movement unlikely. The previous rounds show varied sentiment. The early predictions were based on overall tech sentiment, some focusing on downgrades. The more recent models considered the Reddit news and gave higher probabilities for price decreases recognizing negative sentiment outweighed positive remarks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative.  Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with significant declines in Chinese iPhone shipments and concerns about slowing replacement cycles and lackluster AI integration, points to a substantial risk of a price drop. While Apple's Q1 earnings are anticipated to be strong,  the pre-earnings negative sentiment significantly increases the chance of a negative reaction, even if the earnings meet expectations.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with several models leaning towards a price fall. Considering the current information and the history of previous predictions, a price fall is more likely than a price rise in the short term.  The probabilities are weighted more heavily toward a price decrease due the significant negative factors highlighted in the news and the subsequent downgrade.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant downgrade of Apple by Oppenheimer, citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates. The downgrade and negative outlook are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the mention of delayed iPhone replacement cycles and lack of compelling AI apps further adds to the bearish case. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided focus on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple's upcoming earnings report being 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen.' Cramer lists several potential negative factors, including poor Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a significant cut to the forecast for the rest of the year. However, despite these concerns, Cramer advises investors to hold onto the stock rather than trade it, citing Apple's exceptional management and product quality. Considering these mixed comments and the overall cautious sentiment around major tech earnings, the probabilities are slightly weighted towards a potential stock price fall. The predictions from various models in previous rounds also indicate a cautious outlook, with several models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on the stock market. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures have ticked up, and the strong results from ASML, a key supplier of computer chip-making equipment, have helped to buoy sentiment. However, there are also concerns about the impact of a new Chinese AI model on Big Tech spending and the potential for disappointing earnings reports. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, as the company's upcoming earnings report and the overall market sentiment may lead to a positive movement in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven'Big Tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as a safe asset amidst market uncertainty.

The news suggests a cautious outlook for investors, anticipating potentially suboptimal performance. This information might lead to temporary selling pressures but doesn't fundamentally alter long-term investor sentiments towards Apple. The previous predictions show mixed signals with a range from high confidence in a price increase to high confidence in a price decrease. The current news aligns more with a cautious and pessimistic outlook, but not extreme bearishness.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
