      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer and the concerns over slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China indicate a bearish sentiment for Apple. The reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts suggests that analysts anticipate lower performance in the near future, compounding the negative outlook. Given that iPhone shipments have significantly declined and competition is increasing, there is a strong tendency for investors to react negatively leading up to the earnings report. As a result, the probability of the stock price falling is considerably greater than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\" signals a lack of confidence in Apple's future growth. The lowered price target from $250 also indicates a negative outlook. Several factors contribute to this: weaker than expected iPhone sales projections, increasing competition in China, and a forecasted slowdown in iPhone shipment growth. A significant drop in iPhone shipments and market share in China, coupled with downward revisions in revenue and EPS estimates, further reinforces the negative sentiment. While EBITDA margin improved , the negative impacts mentioned weigh more heavily on potential stock performance. Given these negative factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple from Outperform to Perform is a negative catalyst.  The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are both significant concerns for investors.  China is a crucial market for Apple, and the AI race is heating up, putting pressure on Apple to innovate. While earnings reports can sometimes surprise the market, the downgrade suggests that analysts expect relatively subdued performance. Therefore, it's more likely the stock price will fall in the short term, at least until the earnings report provides clarity. However, the probability is not absolute given the potential of positive surprises from the earnings report or other unforeseen market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s $725 billion investment, which has significantly boosted its earnings per share (EPS), indicating strong financial performance. Since the investment has positively impacted EPS, investors are likely to view this as a positive signal, potentially driving demand for the stock. The fact that the growth isn't tied to AI suggests diversification and stability, which could further bolster investor confidence. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise appears higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the partnership enhances Apple's satellite communication capabilities, potentially increasing the value proposition of iPhones. On the other hand, this move might cannibalize Apple's existing satellite service provided through Globalstar Inc., which saw its shares fall about 11% in premarket trading. However, given that Apple's service is already established and the Starlink integration is with T-Mobile, the overall impact might lean towards being positive due to the expanded features and potential for wider adoption. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, citing a delayed iPhone replacement cycle and lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. This negative outlook is likely to impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the fact that Apple's exports to China dropped significantly in the fourth quarter and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps may further contribute to the downward pressure on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek AI, which is perceived as a competitive threat to U.S. tech companies, has raised geopolitical concerns around national security and data privacy. Although the expert opinion suggests that this might be good for the market as a whole, the immediate impact is likely to trigger uncertainty among investors. Apple Inc., being a major player in the technology sector, may be affected by broader market sentiments related to this news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
