(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThe companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer and the concerns over slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China indicate a bearish sentiment for Apple. The reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts suggests that analysts anticipate lower performance in the near future, compounding the negative outlook. Given that iPhone shipments have significantly declined and competition is increasing, there is a strong tendency for investors to react negatively leading up to the earnings report. As a result, the probability of the stock price falling is considerably greater than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\" signals a lack of confidence in Apple's future growth. The lowered price target from $250 also indicates a negative outlook. Several factors contribute to this: weaker than expected iPhone sales projections, increasing competition in China, and a forecasted slowdown in iPhone shipment growth. A significant drop in iPhone shipments and market share in China, coupled with downward revisions in revenue and EPS estimates, further reinforces the negative sentiment. While EBITDA margin improved , the negative impacts mentioned weigh more heavily on potential stock performance. Given these negative factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple from Outperform to Perform is a negative catalyst.  The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are both significant concerns for investors.  China is a crucial market for Apple, and the AI race is heating up, putting pressure on Apple to innovate. While earnings reports can sometimes surprise the market, the downgrade suggests that analysts expect relatively subdued performance. Therefore, it's more likely the stock price will fall in the short term, at least until the earnings report provides clarity. However, the probability is not absolute given the potential of positive surprises from the earnings report or other unforeseen market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s $725 billion investment, which has significantly boosted its earnings per share (EPS), indicating strong financial performance. Since the investment has positively impacted EPS, investors are likely to view this as a positive signal, potentially driving demand for the stock. The fact that the growth isn't tied to AI suggests diversification and stability, which could further bolster investor confidence. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise appears higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the partnership enhances Apple's satellite communication capabilities, potentially increasing the value proposition of iPhones. On the other hand, this move might cannibalize Apple's existing satellite service provided through Globalstar Inc., which saw its shares fall about 11% in premarket trading. However, given that Apple's service is already established and the Starlink integration is with T-Mobile, the overall impact might lean towards being positive due to the expanded features and potential for wider adoption. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, citing a delayed iPhone replacement cycle and lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. This negative outlook is likely to impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the fact that Apple's exports to China dropped significantly in the fourth quarter and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps may further contribute to the downward pressure on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek AI, which is perceived as a competitive threat to U.S. tech companies, has raised geopolitical concerns around national security and data privacy. Although the expert opinion suggests that this might be good for the market as a whole, the immediate impact is likely to trigger uncertainty among investors. Apple Inc., being a major player in the technology sector, may be affected by broader market sentiments related to this news.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer and the emphasis on slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China indicate a bearish outlook for Apple. Analysts have lowered their revenue and earnings forecasts significantly, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's growth, particularly in a crucial market like China, where iPhone shipments have declined notably. The anticipation of Apple\u2019s upcoming Q1 earnings report adds to the uncertainty, as analysts expect a disappointing performance. Overall, the predominant negative sentiment stemming from these factors leads to a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The current news is predominantly negative, highlighting a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the critical Chinese market. The lowered sales forecasts and EPS estimates for future fiscal years further reinforce a pessimistic outlook. The previous responses predominantly leaned towards a bearish sentiment, though there was some disagreement, especially in the initial rounds. Considering the consistency of negative signals in the news and the prevailing sentiment exhibited in the previous predictions, there's a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. I am placing a higher probability on the stock falling but slightly adjusting it, because the varied results on the previous rounds indicates that there is some amount of uncertainty about how the market will react to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The Oppenheimer downgrade is the primary driver of my prediction.  The cited reasons \u2013 competition in China and lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are significant negative factors.  While Apple's earnings report could provide a positive surprise, the pre-earnings downgrade increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction in the short term. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, and I concur. My assessment is adjusted to account for the weight of the negative news and the overall bearish sentiment indicated by most of the other models. The fact that several models focused on separate unrelated news items further supports a neutral to slightly bearish outlook. I'm slightly less pessimistic than the average, reflecting a possible level of resilience in Apple's stock price or the chance of the market reacting differently than anticipated by the analysts.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment that has positively impacted its earnings per share (EPS), suggesting strong financial performance. This non-tech-based investment indicates diversification and stability, which could bolster investor confidence. However, previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning bearish due to concerns over slowing iPhone sales and competition in China, while others are more optimistic about the financial boost from the investment. Given the positive financial impact of the investment and the potential for investor confidence to rise, the probability of the stock price rising is considered higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is generally positive. This partnership enhances Apple's satellite communication capabilities, potentially increasing the value proposition of iPhones. Although Apple's existing satellite service provided through Globalstar Inc. saw its shares fall about 11% in premarket trading, the Starlink integration with T-Mobile could lead to expanded features and potential for wider adoption. The positive impact of this partnership and the potential for future growth in satellite services likely outweigh the negative reaction to Globalstar's decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, citing a delayed iPhone replacement cycle and lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. This negative outlook is likely to impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the fact that Apple's exports to China dropped significantly in the fourth quarter and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps may further contribute to the downward pressure on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall, with most models estimating a higher probability of a decline. However, some models have predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising, possibly due to other positive factors not mentioned in the article. Taking into account the overall negative sentiment and the downgrade by Oppenheimer, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news discusses geopolitical tensions arising from China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which may raise national security concerns for the U.S. tech sector. Although there's an argument that this might boost competition and efficiency, the prevailing sentiment is negative due to security worries. Several previous predictions indicate a consistent bearish outlook influenced by various factors like Oppenheimer's downgrade, slower iPhone sales, and geopolitical tensions. The recent news adds to these concerns without introducing significant positive elements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The recent downgrade from Oppenheimer reflects significant concerns about Apple's performance, particularly regarding slowing iPhone sales and increased competition in the crucial Chinese market. The reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts further emphasizes a bearish outlook. Given the prevailing sentiment from multiple analyses, which largely indicate a higher probability of a stock price decline, particularly in anticipation of the upcoming earnings report, there is widespread agreement on the negative impact of this news. Despite some mixed signals from unrelated news, the dominant factors suggest a significant likelihood of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The latest news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weakening iPhone sales, particularly in China. Key concerns include shrinking market share in China, reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, and increased competition. The majority of previous predictions also leaned towards a bearish outlook, reflecting the negative sentiment surrounding these factors. Although there were some differing opinions in earlier rounds due to consideration of unrelated news events, the core concern centers around Apple's struggles with iPhone sales and competition, reinforcing a higher probability of a stock price decline. Given the consensus reflected in prior rounds focusing on this bearish news, I align similarly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The Oppenheimer downgrade is the most significant factor influencing my prediction.  The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are substantial negative catalysts.  While Apple's earnings report could offer a positive surprise, the pre-earnings downgrade significantly increases the likelihood of a near-term negative market reaction.  The consensus across multiple previous predictions leans heavily towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The various models considered diverse factors, some positive (investments, partnerships) and some negative (slowing iPhone sales, China market share, geopolitical concerns). However, the weight of negative news, particularly the professional downgrade, overshadows the positives.  Therefore, I assign a greater probability to a price fall, acknowledging the possibility of a positive surprise during the earnings report but emphasizing the immediate negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment that has positively impacted its earnings per share (EPS), suggesting strong financial performance.

The positive impact of this partnership and the potential for future growth in satellite services likely outweigh the negative reaction to Globalstar's decline. However, considering the previous predictions that were influenced by Oppenheimer's downgrade, slowing iPhone sales, and competitive pressures in China, there is a mixed sentiment. The new information suggests a more positive outlook, but it may not entirely counteract the existing negative sentiments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about Apple being downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China indicates a bearish sentiment.
