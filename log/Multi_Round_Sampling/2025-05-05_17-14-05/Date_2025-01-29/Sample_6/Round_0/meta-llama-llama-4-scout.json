The cuts cement Apple\u2019s status as the least-loved megacap except Tesla Inc.\n\nLike the others, Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang cited concerns over iPhone sales in the downgrade, seeing \u201ca twofold challenge ahead for iPhone growth,\u201d including greater competition in China and a \u201clack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to accelerate near-term device replacement.\u201d\n\nIndependent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nShares fell 1.3% on Wednesday. While it remains down 9% from a December record, the stock is coming off a two-day gain of 7%, its largest two-day rally since June. This week\u2019s gain reflects how the emergence of China\u2019s artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek is seen as a positive for Apple, even as it weighed on tech broadly.\n\nApple reports its first-quarter results after the close on Thursday.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This downgrade is part of a series of negative revisions for Apple this month. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst revisions tend to impact stock prices negatively in the short term. However, the stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, which might reflect some positive sentiment or market reaction to other news. Despite this, the overall tone of the news suggests potential short-term challenges for Apple's stock price due to iPhone sales concerns and increased competition. Given that the downgrade and concerns about iPhone growth and competition are likely to influence investor sentiment negatively ahead of Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Gets Another Downgrade on iPhone Risk Ahead of Results\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
