(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

(AAPL) : Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's substantial $725 billion investment and ongoing share repurchase program, which have historically been beneficial for stock price appreciation by reducing share count and increasing EPS. However, there are concerns about stagnating sales of physical products and a high P/E ratio which may indicate overvaluation. The ongoing macroeconomic environment has also contributed to bullish sentiment in the market. Overall, while the investment and buyback program may support the stock, the noted issues could lead to caution among investors, leading to a more balanced outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While analysts haven't significantly revised EPS estimates downwards, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently. Concerns about China revenue are highlighted, although a year-over-year increase is projected for the upcoming quarter. Positive momentum in Services is noted, but iPhone sales and the adoption of Apple Intelligence are key uncertainties. The article mentions that it is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Overall, the mixed signals and potentially negative outlook weigh toward a downward price movement. The projections highlight positive movement in areas to watch, but given the mentioned issues, I am leaning towards a slightly greater potential for the stock falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected revenue growth is positive (3.8%), it's significantly lower than the previous quarter and below analyst expectations.  This slowdown is attributed to several factors: slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, lagging behind competitors (especially in China), and a stronger US dollar affecting international sales. The loss of market share in China, a key market, is particularly concerning. Although the services sector is expected to show strong growth, it may not be enough to offset the weaker performance in hardware sales. The overall tone of the news is negative, emphasizing the challenges Apple faces.  However, Apple is a large, established company, and the 3.8% growth is still positive, suggesting the market may already have priced in some of the negative news. Therefore, while a price drop is more likely given the current information, a complete collapse is less probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market by offering a cost-effective alternative to US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of DeepSeek could be seen as competitive pressure, the focus on national security concerns and data privacy issues might lead to regulatory scrutiny or trade tensions, which could negatively impact US tech stocks. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the risks. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to geopolitical and competitive concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales and competition in China. This downgrade is part of a series of negative revisions for Apple this month. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst revisions tend to impact stock prices negatively in the short term. However, the stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, which might reflect some positive sentiment or market reaction to other news. Despite this, the overall tone of the news suggests potential short-term challenges for Apple's stock price due to iPhone sales concerns and increased competition. Given that the downgrade and concerns about iPhone growth and competition are likely to influence investor sentiment negatively ahead of Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The investment firm has also reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth. This negative sentiment, combined with the expectation of a slow iPhone replacement cycle, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the stock price was only down a fraction in morning trading, indicating that the market may have already partially priced in this information. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Services were strong and iPhone sales were critical. The stock had a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Previous model predictions were mostly negative. Taking into account these factors, the analysis leans slightly towards a mixed to potentially slightly negative outlook, even though the time to profit from this outlook has passed.
