(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's substantial $725 billion investment and ongoing share repurchase program, which have historically been beneficial for stock price appreciation by reducing share count and increasing EPS. However, there are concerns about stagnating sales of physical products and a high P/E ratio which may indicate overvaluation. The ongoing macroeconomic environment has also contributed to bullish sentiment in the market. Overall, while the investment and buyback program may support the stock, the noted issues could lead to caution among investors, leading to a more balanced outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While analysts haven't significantly revised EPS estimates downwards, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently. Concerns about China revenue are highlighted, although a year-over-year increase is projected for the upcoming quarter. Positive momentum in Services is noted, but iPhone sales and the adoption of Apple Intelligence are key uncertainties. The article mentions that it is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Overall, the mixed signals and potentially negative outlook weigh toward a downward price movement. The projections highlight positive movement in areas to watch, but given the mentioned issues, I am leaning towards a slightly greater potential for the stock falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected revenue growth is positive (3.8%), it's significantly lower than the previous quarter and below analyst expectations.  This slowdown is attributed to several factors: slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, lagging behind competitors (especially in China), and a stronger US dollar affecting international sales. The loss of market share in China, a key market, is particularly concerning. Although the services sector is expected to show strong growth, it may not be enough to offset the weaker performance in hardware sales. The overall tone of the news is negative, emphasizing the challenges Apple faces.  However, Apple is a large, established company, and the 3.8% growth is still positive, suggesting the market may already have priced in some of the negative news. Therefore, while a price drop is more likely given the current information, a complete collapse is less probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market by offering a cost-effective alternative to US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of DeepSeek could be seen as competitive pressure, the focus on national security concerns and data privacy issues might lead to regulatory scrutiny or trade tensions, which could negatively impact US tech stocks. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the risks. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to geopolitical and competitive concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales and competition in China. This downgrade is part of a series of negative revisions for Apple this month. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst revisions tend to impact stock prices negatively in the short term. However, the stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, which might reflect some positive sentiment or market reaction to other news. Despite this, the overall tone of the news suggests potential short-term challenges for Apple's stock price due to iPhone sales concerns and increased competition. Given that the downgrade and concerns about iPhone growth and competition are likely to influence investor sentiment negatively ahead of Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The investment firm has also reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth. This negative sentiment, combined with the expectation of a slow iPhone replacement cycle, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the stock price was only down a fraction in morning trading, indicating that the market may have already partially priced in this information. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
