(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's substantial $725 billion investment and ongoing share repurchase program, which have historically been beneficial for stock price appreciation by reducing share count and increasing EPS. However, there are concerns about stagnating sales of physical products and a high P/E ratio which may indicate overvaluation. The ongoing macroeconomic environment has also contributed to bullish sentiment in the market. Overall, while the investment and buyback program may support the stock, the noted issues could lead to caution among investors, leading to a more balanced outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While analysts haven't significantly revised EPS estimates downwards, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently. Concerns about China revenue are highlighted, although a year-over-year increase is projected for the upcoming quarter. Positive momentum in Services is noted, but iPhone sales and the adoption of Apple Intelligence are key uncertainties. The article mentions that it is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Overall, the mixed signals and potentially negative outlook weigh toward a downward price movement. The projections highlight positive movement in areas to watch, but given the mentioned issues, I am leaning towards a slightly greater potential for the stock falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected revenue growth is positive (3.8%), it's significantly lower than the previous quarter and below analyst expectations.  This slowdown is attributed to several factors: slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, lagging behind competitors (especially in China), and a stronger US dollar affecting international sales. The loss of market share in China, a key market, is particularly concerning. Although the services sector is expected to show strong growth, it may not be enough to offset the weaker performance in hardware sales. The overall tone of the news is negative, emphasizing the challenges Apple faces.  However, Apple is a large, established company, and the 3.8% growth is still positive, suggesting the market may already have priced in some of the negative news. Therefore, while a price drop is more likely given the current information, a complete collapse is less probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market by offering a cost-effective alternative to US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of DeepSeek could be seen as competitive pressure, the focus on national security concerns and data privacy issues might lead to regulatory scrutiny or trade tensions, which could negatively impact US tech stocks. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the risks. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to geopolitical and competitive concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales and competition in China. This downgrade is part of a series of negative revisions for Apple this month. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst revisions tend to impact stock prices negatively in the short term. However, the stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, which might reflect some positive sentiment or market reaction to other news. Despite this, the overall tone of the news suggests potential short-term challenges for Apple's stock price due to iPhone sales concerns and increased competition. Given that the downgrade and concerns about iPhone growth and competition are likely to influence investor sentiment negatively ahead of Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The investment firm has also reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth. This negative sentiment, combined with the expectation of a slow iPhone replacement cycle, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the stock price was only down a fraction in morning trading, indicating that the market may have already partially priced in this information. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Given the substantial $725 billion investment highlighted in the news, along with Apple's continuous share buyback program, there's a long-term bullish sentiment for Apple's stock. The buybacks can reduce share supply, thereby potentially increasing EPS, which typically supports higher stock prices. However, there are significant concerns, including stagnating sales in physical products, a historically high P/E ratio indicating possible overvaluation, and potential negative influences from competition (especially in China) and macroeconomic factors. Thus, while the investment and buyback can support a rise in stock price, the underlying issues lead to a measured and more cautious outlook about Apple's short-term performance. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight leaning towards a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. The article is from late January 2025, so we are past the earnings report. The key takeaways are: Apple had been underperforming. EPS revisions were stable, while top-line revisions were slightly negative. China revenue was a concern but expected to improve. Services were strong and iPhone sales were critical. The stock had a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Previous model predictions were mostly negative. Taking into account these factors, the analysis leans slightly towards a mixed to potentially slightly negative outlook, even though the time to profit from this outlook has passed. I will now include the negative consensus from the previous rounds, and the Zacks Sell rating, as being representative of real-world sentiment that would drag the probability of the stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple's short-term performance.  Key concerns include slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, lagging behind competitors in the crucial Chinese market (with a 10 percentage point market share loss), and the impact of a stronger dollar on international sales. While the services sector is expected to grow, this is unlikely to fully offset the weakness in hardware sales, particularly iPhones.  The expected revenue growth of 3.8% is significantly lower than previous quarters and below analyst expectations.  Previous predictions from various models range from 0.25 to 0.55 probability of a price rise, with the majority leaning towards a price fall (probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.75). Considering the negative factors outweighing the positive ones, and given the consensus of previous models, I am assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI, which could pose competitive and geopolitical risks for US tech companies, including Apple. While Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some risks, the emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI alternative and potential national security concerns could negatively impact investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-70% chance of a decline. The overall sentiment is slightly negative due to competitive and geopolitical pressures, though Apple's resilience may limit the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales and competition in China. This downgrade is part of a series of negative revisions for Apple this month. The concerns cited include greater competition in China and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to accelerate near-term device replacement. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst revisions tend to impact stock prices negatively in the short term. The stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, which might reflect some positive sentiment or market reaction to other news. However, the overall tone of the news suggests potential short-term challenges for Apple's stock price due to iPhone sales concerns and increased competition. Given that the downgrade and concerns about iPhone growth and competition are likely to influence investor sentiment negatively ahead of Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, which are key concerns for the company's growth prospects. The investment firm has reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as risks for iPhone growth. This information, combined with the expectation of a slow iPhone replacement cycle, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models have a trend of leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models having a probability of stock price fall above 0.6. Considering this information, I have estimated the probabilities of stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the upcoming earnings and capital expenditure (capex) announcements from big tech companies. Specifically, Apple Inc.'s stock price movement probabilities need to be estimated considering the mixed signals from recent analyst projections and historical performance indicators. Previous predictions suggest consistent negative sentiment towards the stock price due to concerns over iPhone sales, market share in China, and competitive pressures from companies like DeepSeek. Despite this, there is a slight positive sentiment reflected in historical stock gains and the mention of strong services revenue. Given the overall negative outlook provided by previous models and the emphasis on CEO commentary and AI chip investments, the analysis leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis considers Apple's substantial $725 billion investment, its ongoing share repurchase program, and the dual impact of stagnant physical product sales and a high P/E ratio suggesting overvaluation. Notable concerns regarding competition in China and the effectiveness of AI integration heighten the risks associated with the stock. Previous predictions by various models indicate an overall negative sentiment towards the stock price, with probabilities largely favoring a decline. Thus, I predict a significant likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple leading up to its earnings report in January 2025. The stock was already underperforming, and analysts had stable EPS revisions but slightly negative top-line revisions. Key areas of concern included China revenue, though a year-over-year increase was expected. Services segment growth was strong, but iPhone sales and the success of \"Apple Intelligence\" were crucial uncertainties. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicated bearish analyst sentiment. The previous rounds of predictions also consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, influenced by concerns regarding competition, particularly in China, and slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, along with Oppenheimer's downgrade. Considering the negative momentum and concerns, I'm assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple's short-term prospects.  Key weaknesses include slower-than-expected AI integration, lagging competitors in China (significant market share loss), and a stronger dollar impacting international sales. While the services sector shows strength, it's unlikely to fully compensate for weakness in hardware, especially iPhones. The projected 3.8% revenue growth is significantly below previous quarters and analyst expectations.  Previous model predictions consistently favored a price fall (mostly above 0.6 probability), reflecting a prevailing negative sentiment.  The combination of these factors \u2013 weaker-than-expected sales, competitive pressures, and currency headwinds \u2013 strongly suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.  While Apple's size and brand strength might mitigate the impact, the immediate outlook appears bearish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI posing competitive and geopolitical risks for US tech companies, including Apple.

The downgrade by Oppenheimer and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts due to increased competition in China and lack of compelling generative AI applications suggest potential short-term challenges for Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, and the overall negative sentiment expressed in the news article, I have estimated the probabilities of stock price movement. The fact that Apple's stock was only down a fraction in morning trading may indicate that the market has partially priced in this information, but the concerns over iPhone sales and competition in China are likely to continue influencing investor sentiment negatively ahead of Apple's earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the upcoming earnings and capital expenditure (capex) announcements from big tech companies.

However, significant concerns about stagnating sales of physical products, historically high P/E ratios suggesting overvaluation, and competitive pressures, particularly in China, weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The ongoing negative sentiment from analyst downgrades and previous predictions leaning towards stock price declines reinforce the likelihood of a price drop. Therefore, the estimated probabilities suggest a higher chance of falling stock prices compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article from January 2025 paints a mixed but generally negative picture for Apple. While Services are strong and China revenue is projected to improve slightly, concerns remain about lagging AI integration, competition in China, and weaker iPhone sales. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates analyst bearishness. Previous rounds of predictions consistently favored a price fall. Considering the historical negative sentiment and analyst downgrades, alongside continued concerns, the likelihood of the stock price falling remains higher than the chance of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple's short-term stock performance.  Key concerns include slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, significant market share losses in China (a key market), and the negative impact of a stronger US dollar on international sales. While the services sector is expected to show growth, this is insufficient to offset the weaknesses in hardware sales, particularly iPhones. The projected 3.8% revenue growth is considerably lower than previous quarters and below analyst expectations.  Previous model predictions consistently pointed towards a higher probability of a price fall (mostly above 0.6 probability).  The consensus among the various models, along with the negative factors outlined in the news (slowing iPhone sales, increased competition, and currency headwinds), strongly suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline.  Apple's size and brand strength may offer some mitigation, but the short-term outlook appears bearish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns, which could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. The emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI alternative and potential national security concerns might lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or trade tensions, affecting investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-70% chance of a decline. While Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some risks, the overall sentiment is slightly negative due to competitive and geopolitical pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.

Previous predictions across multiple rounds have shown a consistent trend of higher probabilities of the stock price falling, with factors such as concerns over iPhone sales, market share in China, competitive pressures from companies like DeepSeek, and the impact of national security concerns on US tech. These consistent negative sentiments, along with the specific news content focusing on AI investments and the mixed reception in recent quarters, contribute to an outlook that is more bearish.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
