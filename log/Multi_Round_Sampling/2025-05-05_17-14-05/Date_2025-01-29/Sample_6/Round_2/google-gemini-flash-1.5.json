(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition\nNews Content: By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth on Thursday as its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season.\n\nThe company and its rivals Google and Samsung have been leaning on AI to drive sales of their devices. But Apple's latest iPhone 16 series lacked such features at launch in September and some of its AI services, including an improved Siri, are only expected later this year in some regions.\n\nApple's challenges with AI were highlighted this month when it had to pull a news-summarizing AI tool due to inaccurate headlines, which drew criticism from the BBC and other news outlets.\n\n\"AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple's handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\" said Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns Apple shares.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei as well as other Chinese smartphone makers, Apple saw its share of the global smartphone market narrow to 23% in the final three months of 2024 from almost 25% a year earlier, according to IDC data.\n\nThe decline was steeper in China - its third-largest market - where Apple's share fell by 10 percentage points to 17%, the data showed.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has been offering subsidies to smartphone purchasers to boost domestic consumption, these subsidies target low- to mid-tier phones priced below $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nWorries about iPhone demand have weighed on Apple shares this year, dragging them 5% lower so far in January.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to post revenue growth of 3.8% for the three months to December, Apple's first fiscal quarter, according to data from LSEG. That is well below the 6.1% growth the company posted in the September quarter, which included only a few days of new iPhone sales.\n\nSales of iPhone will likely tick up 1.9% in the first quarter, weaker than the 5.5% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nMac sales are expected to rise 2.3%, slightly faster compared with the previous three months, while iPad revenue is expected to increase by 4.2%, a slower pace than the fourth quarter.\n\nThe services business, which has in recent years outpaced growth in Apple's devices, is expected to post an increase of 12.9% in sales.\n\nLike other companies with a large global presence, Apple is also set to be hit by a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened by nearly 8% in the final three months of 2024 amid expectations for trade tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"With more than 50% of sales coming from outside of the Americas, the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen in the December quarter could make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates,\" warned Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's substantial $725 billion investment and ongoing share repurchase program, which have historically been beneficial for stock price appreciation by reducing share count and increasing EPS. However, there are concerns about stagnating sales of physical products and a high P/E ratio which may indicate overvaluation. The ongoing macroeconomic environment has also contributed to bullish sentiment in the market. Overall, while the investment and buyback program may support the stock, the noted issues could lead to caution among investors, leading to a more balanced outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While analysts haven't significantly revised EPS estimates downwards, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently. Concerns about China revenue are highlighted, although a year-over-year increase is projected for the upcoming quarter. Positive momentum in Services is noted, but iPhone sales and the adoption of Apple Intelligence are key uncertainties. The article mentions that it is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Overall, the mixed signals and potentially negative outlook weigh toward a downward price movement. The projections highlight positive movement in areas to watch, but given the mentioned issues, I am leaning towards a slightly greater potential for the stock falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected revenue growth is positive (3.8%), it's significantly lower than the previous quarter and below analyst expectations.  This slowdown is attributed to several factors: slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, lagging behind competitors (especially in China), and a stronger US dollar affecting international sales. The loss of market share in China, a key market, is particularly concerning. Although the services sector is expected to show strong growth, it may not be enough to offset the weaker performance in hardware sales. The overall tone of the news is negative, emphasizing the challenges Apple faces.  However, Apple is a large, established company, and the 3.8% growth is still positive, suggesting the market may already have priced in some of the negative news. Therefore, while a price drop is more likely given the current information, a complete collapse is less probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market by offering a cost-effective alternative to US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of DeepSeek could be seen as competitive pressure, the focus on national security concerns and data privacy issues might lead to regulatory scrutiny or trade tensions, which could negatively impact US tech stocks. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the risks. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to geopolitical and competitive concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales and competition in China. This downgrade is part of a series of negative revisions for Apple this month. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst revisions tend to impact stock prices negatively in the short term. However, the stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, which might reflect some positive sentiment or market reaction to other news. Despite this, the overall tone of the news suggests potential short-term challenges for Apple's stock price due to iPhone sales concerns and increased competition. Given that the downgrade and concerns about iPhone growth and competition are likely to influence investor sentiment negatively ahead of Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The investment firm has also reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth. This negative sentiment, combined with the expectation of a slow iPhone replacement cycle, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the stock price was only down a fraction in morning trading, indicating that the market may have already partially priced in this information. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Given the substantial $725 billion investment highlighted in the news, along with Apple's continuous share buyback program, there's a long-term bullish sentiment for Apple's stock. The buybacks can reduce share supply, thereby potentially increasing EPS, which typically supports higher stock prices. However, there are significant concerns, including stagnating sales in physical products, a historically high P/E ratio indicating possible overvaluation, and potential negative influences from competition (especially in China) and macroeconomic factors. Thus, while the investment and buyback can support a rise in stock price, the underlying issues lead to a measured and more cautious outlook about Apple's short-term performance. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight leaning towards a price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. The article is from late January 2025, so we are past the earnings report. The key takeaways are: Apple had been underperforming. EPS revisions were stable, while top-line revisions were slightly negative. China revenue was a concern but expected to improve. Services were strong and iPhone sales were critical. The stock had a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Previous model predictions were mostly negative. Taking into account these factors, the analysis leans slightly towards a mixed to potentially slightly negative outlook, even though the time to profit from this outlook has passed. I will now include the negative consensus from the previous rounds, and the Zacks Sell rating, as being representative of real-world sentiment that would drag the probability of the stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple's short-term performance.  Key concerns include slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, lagging behind competitors in the crucial Chinese market (with a 10 percentage point market share loss), and the impact of a stronger dollar on international sales. While the services sector is expected to grow, this is unlikely to fully offset the weakness in hardware sales, particularly iPhones.  The expected revenue growth of 3.8% is significantly lower than previous quarters and below analyst expectations.  Previous predictions from various models range from 0.25 to 0.55 probability of a price rise, with the majority leaning towards a price fall (probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.75). Considering the negative factors outweighing the positive ones, and given the consensus of previous models, I am assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI, which could pose competitive and geopolitical risks for US tech companies, including Apple. While Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some risks, the emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI alternative and potential national security concerns could negatively impact investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-70% chance of a decline. The overall sentiment is slightly negative due to competitive and geopolitical pressures, though Apple's resilience may limit the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales and competition in China. This downgrade is part of a series of negative revisions for Apple this month. The concerns cited include greater competition in China and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to accelerate near-term device replacement. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst revisions tend to impact stock prices negatively in the short term. The stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, which might reflect some positive sentiment or market reaction to other news. However, the overall tone of the news suggests potential short-term challenges for Apple's stock price due to iPhone sales concerns and increased competition. Given that the downgrade and concerns about iPhone growth and competition are likely to influence investor sentiment negatively ahead of Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China, which are key concerns for the company's growth prospects. The investment firm has reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as risks for iPhone growth. This information, combined with the expectation of a slow iPhone replacement cycle, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models have a trend of leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models having a probability of stock price fall above 0.6. Considering this information, I have estimated the probabilities of stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the upcoming earnings and capital expenditure (capex) announcements from big tech companies. Specifically, Apple Inc.'s stock price movement probabilities need to be estimated considering the mixed signals from recent analyst projections and historical performance indicators. Previous predictions suggest consistent negative sentiment towards the stock price due to concerns over iPhone sales, market share in China, and competitive pressures from companies like DeepSeek. Despite this, there is a slight positive sentiment reflected in historical stock gains and the mention of strong services revenue. Given the overall negative outlook provided by previous models and the emphasis on CEO commentary and AI chip investments, the analysis leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
