The previous predictions from various models show a mixed trend, but generally, there is a slight inclination towards a lower stock price for AAPL as more models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. Given that the news is not directly related to Apple, it is reasonable to assume that the stock price movement probabilities remain relatively stable and are influenced more by the overall market sentiment and previous predictions rather than this specific news.
