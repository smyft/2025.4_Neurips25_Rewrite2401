The Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates quickly adds pressure on corporate earnings to sustain market performance. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment with some models showing a slight optimism (e.g., gpt-4o-mini, qwen-turbo) while others are more pessimistic (e.g., gemini models, llama-3.3-70b-instruct). Over the rounds, the predictions have shown a slight convergence towards a neutral stance, with probabilities hovering around 0.5 for both rise and fall. Given the mixed signals from the news and the previous predictions, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a cautious optimism leaning slightly towards a rise due to the potential positive impact of earnings season.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```"
