The mention of the Fed unlikely to cut interest rates quickly adds to the cautious sentiment, making corporate earnings growth critical. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed outlook, with some leaning towards a rise (e.g., GPT-4o-mini at 0.65) and others towards a fall (e.g., Gemini-2.0-flash at 0.6). The average of these predictions suggests a slight bias towards a rise, but the uncertainty in the news content tempers this optimism. Considering the mixed signals and the importance of upcoming earnings, the probabilities are balanced but with a slight edge towards a rise due to potential positive earnings surprises.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```"
