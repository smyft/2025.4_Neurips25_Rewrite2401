(AAPL)\nNews Headline: ASML stock rises after earnings beat as CEO says DeepSeek will drive AI chip demand higher\nNews Content: ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on January 29, 2025.
