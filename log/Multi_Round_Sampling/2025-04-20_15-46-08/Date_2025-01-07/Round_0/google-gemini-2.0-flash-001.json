Without specific details about the nature of the unfortunate news, it's reasonable to assume it will negatively impact investor sentiment. This negative sentiment is likely to lead to selling pressure, increasing the probability of a stock price decline. However, Apple is a large, resilient company, and a single negative headline may not cause a dramatic drop.
