Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of decreasing confidence in the stock price rising, with models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 consistently predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Over the rounds, the average probability of the stock price rising has slightly decreased, while the probability of it falling has increased. This aligns with the negative sentiment of the news headline. However, some models still maintain a neutral or slightly positive outlook, suggesting that the negative impact may not be extreme.
