(AAPL) is expected to soar to a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst, due to its involvement in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This positive outlook on the company's future valuation could lead to increased investor confidence and, subsequently, a rise in the stock price. However, it's essential to note that the news does not provide specific, immediate catalysts for the stock price movement. The prediction is based on the potential for AI-related growth, which might already be partially priced into the stock. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling, but not extremely high as it's based on a future prediction and involves uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
