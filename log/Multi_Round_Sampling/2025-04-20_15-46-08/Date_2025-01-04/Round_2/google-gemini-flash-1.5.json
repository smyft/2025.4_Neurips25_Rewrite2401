Therefore, the news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  However, the previous predictions show a trend of increasing belief in Apple's stock price rising.  While the news itself provides no reason for Apple's stock to move, the consistent upward trend in previous predictions suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple that is independent of this particular news item.
