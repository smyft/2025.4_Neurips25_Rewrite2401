Therefore, the news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price movement.  My prediction will primarily rely on the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions.  While some models predict a high probability of a price rise (up to 0.8), others are more cautious (as low as 0.3).  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the spread in previous predictions, I'll lean towards a neutral stance, slightly weighted towards a rise due to the overall positive sentiment in the previous round's predictions.  The average probability of a rise from the previous round is approximately 0.55, and I will adjust slightly upward to account for the generally positive market sentiment surrounding AI.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.58,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.42\n}\n```\n"
