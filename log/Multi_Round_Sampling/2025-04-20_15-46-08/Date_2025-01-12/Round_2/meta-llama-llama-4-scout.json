The article discusses iPhone storage issues and potential solutions, which is more of a user advice piece than a company performance indicator. However, considering that the previous predictions had a general leaning towards a slight decrease or stability in stock price, with most models predicting a higher chance of the stock price falling than rising, it seems that the overall sentiment might be slightly negative or neutral. Given that the news does not provide substantial positive or negative information about Apple's financial health or future prospects, and based on the neutral nature of the article which does not imply a significant change in the company's performance, I will make a prediction that is slightly aligned with the general trend of previous predictions but also taking into account the neutral nature of the news provided.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Your iPhone Storage Is Full Again.
