Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The high valuation metrics (P/E, PSR, Price-to-cash flow) are the most significant concerns raised. While Apple's past performance has been exceptional, sustaining such high growth rates from its current market cap is challenging. The previous predictions show a general leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6.  Considering the article's emphasis on valuation concerns and the consensus of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise, but acknowledging the potential for continued growth in AI and other areas.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Largest Company in the World.
