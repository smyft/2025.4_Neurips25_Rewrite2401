This news does not inherently contain negative information about Apple's products or services but rather highlights a potential opportunity for users to upgrade their devices. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive as it suggests potential for increased sales through upgrades. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general trend indicating a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, but the differences are not substantial. Given the neutral to positive implications of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Your iPhone Storage Is Full Again.
