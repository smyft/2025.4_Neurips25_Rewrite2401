      "content": "{\n\"reasoning\": \"The news headline 'Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2025?' is neutral and does not provide any specific positive or negative information about the company. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of mixed beliefs about the stock price movement. Some models have a higher prediction of the stock price rising, while others have a lower prediction. Taking these predictions into consideration, I will estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling based on the average of the previous predictions. The average prediction of the stock price rising is around 0.4, and the average prediction of the stock price falling is around 0.4. Therefore, I will estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.5 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.5, indicating a neutral stance.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2025?\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}"
