Therefore, the news itself has no predictive power.  To estimate the probability of a price rise or fall, I will rely heavily on the previous predictions from various models.  The initial predictions were quite varied, but there's a slight tendency towards a higher probability of a price rise.  Over the three rounds, some models show a shift towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, while others show a shift towards a fall.  However, the overall trend isn't strongly defined.  Given the lack of substantial news and the inconsistent predictions, I will assign probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting the uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Should You Buy Apple Stock Right Now in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```\n"
