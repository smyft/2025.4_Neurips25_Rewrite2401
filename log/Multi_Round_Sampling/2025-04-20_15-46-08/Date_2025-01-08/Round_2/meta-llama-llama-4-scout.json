Given that the news is not directly related to Apple, it's unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. However, the overall sentiment of the news seems neutral or slightly positive towards Nvidia, which might indirectly affect the tech sector. Without specific information about Apple, we rely on the previous predictions which show a general neutrality or slight pessimism.
