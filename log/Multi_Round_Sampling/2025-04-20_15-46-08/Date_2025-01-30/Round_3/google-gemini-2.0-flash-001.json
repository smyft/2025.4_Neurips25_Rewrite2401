(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\nNews Content: Apple's (AAPL) earnings beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines for the fiscal first quarter despite some weakness in iPhone sales and missed revenue estimates in the Greater China region.\n\nNew Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to discuss the results and explain his reaction to the earnings print.\n\n\"We remain concerned about the next couple of quarters, and that's for a number of reasons,\" Chkaiban says, outlining three issues driving this concern for the iPhone maker in the near term.\n\n\"First, we're not convinced that on-device [artificial intelligence] AI will enable game-changing user experiences because the hardware is not game-changing,\" he says. \"Apple Intelligence features that are tightly integrated with the operating system, with iOS, have not really gotten great feedback so far.\"\n\n\"On top of that, you have elongating replacement cycles,\" Chkaiban explains, which only makes users less likely to justify upgrading their devices. \u76f8\u95dc\u5f71\u7247\n\n20:42\n\nApple Q1 earnings, market takeaways: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 01:35\n\nOne portfolio manager's picks to hedge tariff risk\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:17\n\nAre veteran transition programs seeing return on investment?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 14 hours ago\n\nFinally, \"you have the fact that share gains in China, which have been a tailwind in the past, have now stalled,\" he notes, highlighting Apple's struggle to compete in China as competition intensifies with domestic smartphone makers.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\n\u67e5\u770b\u7559\u8a00\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price.

Specifically, the analyst highlights potential issues with on-device AI, elongating replacement cycles, and stalled growth in China. These are significant headwinds that could negatively impact future revenue and profitability.
