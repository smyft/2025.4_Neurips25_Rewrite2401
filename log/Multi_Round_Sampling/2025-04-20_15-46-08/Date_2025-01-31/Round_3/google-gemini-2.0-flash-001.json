This is generally positive news, suggesting strong performance in a key area. However, the news content also mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' which introduces some uncertainty. Considering the positive headline and the beat on analyst estimates, I would lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. Looking at the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models are consistently bearish (qwen-turbo), while others are more bullish (google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, meta-llama/llama-4-scout). There isn't a clear trend towards increasing bullishness or bearishness across all models. Given the positive news and the mixed but slightly positive sentiment from other models, I will adjust my prediction to reflect a higher probability of a stock price increase, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the 'mixed performance' caveat.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's Q1 Services Revenue Jump Helps It Beat Analyst Estimates\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.62,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.38\n}\n```"
