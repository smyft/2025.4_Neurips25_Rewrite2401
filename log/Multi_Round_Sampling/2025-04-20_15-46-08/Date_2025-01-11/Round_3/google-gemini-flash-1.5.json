It does not directly mention Apple or provide any information relevant to Apple's stock performance. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  However, the previous predictions show a general trend towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.  While some models show uncertainty or even a slight downward trend, the majority consistently predict a higher chance of a rise.  Considering the lack of direct relevance of the news and the overall positive trend in previous predictions, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly upward from the average of previous rounds, but not drastically.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```\n"
