While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't provide any information directly impacting Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price movement.  The previous predictions show a generally positive sentiment towards Apple's stock, with a slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise across multiple rounds.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the news and the generally positive previous predictions, I'm weighting the prediction more towards the previous models' consensus.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
