While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's stock performance. Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price movement.  The previous predictions show a general trend towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, with some models consistently predicting a higher probability of a rise and others showing more fluctuation.  The overall trend suggests a slightly positive outlook.  Given the irrelevance of the news and the previous predictions, I'll weight my prediction more heavily on the previous predictions, adjusting slightly for the lack of negative news directly impacting Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.62,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.38\n}\n```\n"
