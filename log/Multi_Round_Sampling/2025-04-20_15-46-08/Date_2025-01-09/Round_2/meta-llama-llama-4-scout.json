There are no direct negative statements about Apple's prospects, but rather a comparison that may imply Apple's potential in AI is being considered. Given that multiple models have previously predicted probabilities with a general trend towards a higher chance of the stock price rising than falling, and considering that Apple is a major player in the tech industry with significant investments in AI, I will analyze the trend and the information provided. Most predictions from previous rounds suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling, with some models providing high probabilities (e.g., 0.7, 0.8) for a stock price increase. This indicates a generally positive sentiment towards Apple's stock. Therefore, based on the information given and the trend from previous predictions, I estimate that the stock price of Apple has a higher probability of rising than falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple vs. Microsoft: Which Is the Better Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
