The content of the news indicates that investors are anticipating the company's next growth run, which implies a bullish sentiment. Analyzing the previous predictions from various models, there is a general trend of increasing confidence in the stock price rising, with some models showing a significant increase in their prediction of a stock price rise from Round 0 to Round 2. For example, the meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct model increased its prediction from 0.7 to 0.8, and the qwen/qwen-turbo model increased its prediction from -1 (not available) to 0.85. This trend, combined with the positive news, supports a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's essential to consider that the stock market can be volatile, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Therefore, while the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher, there is still a chance it could fall due to unforeseen market conditions or other factors not mentioned in the news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Apple Stock Gained 30% Last Year\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.82,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.18\n}\n```"
