This positive sentiment is reflected in the previous predictions, where most models show an increasing probability of the stock price rising over the rounds. The consensus among the models has shifted towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with some models (e.g., qwen/qwen-turbo) predicting an 85% chance of a rise in Round 2. The latest round (Round 3) shows continued optimism, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.82 for a rise.
