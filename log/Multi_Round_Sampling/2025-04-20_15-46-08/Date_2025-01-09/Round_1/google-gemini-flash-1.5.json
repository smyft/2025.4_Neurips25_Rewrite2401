      "content": "```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news headline indicates strong positive sentiment towards Apple stock, citing a 30% gain last year and investor anticipation of continued growth.  However, the previous predictions are mixed.  Some models show a strong probability of a price rise (0.7-0.75), while others are more pessimistic (0.3-0.4).  The highly negative prediction from qwen/qwen-turbo (-1) is likely an error and should be disregarded.  Considering the positive news and the overall leaning towards a price rise in the previous predictions (excluding the outlier), I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the uncertainty reflected in the varied predictions.  I'm adjusting the probability slightly downward from the most optimistic predictions to account for the dissenting opinions and inherent market volatility.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Apple Stock Gained 30% Last Year\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```\n"
