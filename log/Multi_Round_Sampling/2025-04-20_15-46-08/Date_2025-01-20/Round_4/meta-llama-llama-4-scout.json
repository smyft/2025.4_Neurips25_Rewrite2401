(AAPL) CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of the CEO at the inauguration may be perceived as a neutral or slightly positive event, as it indicates a connection with the incoming administration. However, the market's reaction is often influenced by the perceived impact of political events on a company's future prospects. Given that the news does not contain any directly positive or negative information about Apple's financials or operations, the impact is likely to be minimal. The previous predictions from various models show a slight leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but the differences are not significant. Therefore, based on this news alone, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but still with a cautious outlook.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.48,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.52\n}\n```"
