This event, in itself, doesn't directly imply a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the presence of Tim Cook alongside other tech leaders like Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg could be interpreted as a sign of potential collaboration or negotiation between the tech industry and the new administration. This could lead to policies that are either favorable or unfavorable to Apple. Given the uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral or slightly negative reaction, considering the potential for policy changes that might not be beneficial. Also, the previous rounds of predictions show a slight trend towards a negative outlook. Therefore, I will lean slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.43,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.57\n}\n```"
