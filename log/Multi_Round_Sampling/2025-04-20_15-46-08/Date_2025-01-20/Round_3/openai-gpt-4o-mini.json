However, the context of Big Tech executives and their relationships with the incoming administration may influence market sentiment towards tech stocks in general. Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds, with a slight lean towards bearish sentiment, I estimate a moderate probability of AAPL's stock price falling, as the overall market sentiment may be cautious.
