The presence of the CEO at a significant political event may be perceived neutrally or slightly positively, as it indicates a connection with the incoming administration. However, the impact on stock price is typically more directly influenced by specific policy announcements or changes that could affect a company's business operations. Without specific details on how Trump's administration might affect Apple, the news seems more neutral than a direct catalyst for stock movement. Given the mixed predictions from previous models, it seems that the overall market sentiment is uncertain. Based on this, I would estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but still keep it relatively balanced due to the neutral nature of the news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```"
