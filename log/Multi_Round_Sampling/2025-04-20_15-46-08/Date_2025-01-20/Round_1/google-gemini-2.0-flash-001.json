This event, in itself, is not inherently positive or negative for Apple's stock. However, the market's perception of Trump's policies and their potential impact on Apple could influence the stock price. Given the mixed reactions to Trump's policies in the past, it's difficult to definitively say whether this news will cause the stock to rise or fall. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some models leaning towards a fall and others towards a rise, indicating uncertainty. Considering this, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more positive outlook, assuming the market might interpret the attendance as a sign of potential cooperation between Apple and the new administration, which could be beneficial. However, I will keep the probabilities relatively close to 0.5 to reflect the inherent uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```"
