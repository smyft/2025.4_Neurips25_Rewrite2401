While the article doesn't explicitly name the company, the context strongly suggests it's Apple (given the question 'Is it a buy now?').  Buffett's investment is a strong positive signal, indicating confidence in the company's future performance.  However, the market's reaction isn't guaranteed to be solely positive.  The stock price might already reflect much of this positive sentiment, limiting further upside.  Additionally, broader market conditions and other news could influence the stock price regardless of Buffett's investment.
