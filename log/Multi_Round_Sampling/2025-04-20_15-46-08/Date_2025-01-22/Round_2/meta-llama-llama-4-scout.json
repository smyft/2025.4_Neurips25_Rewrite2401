(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $1B Deal Poised to End Indonesia iPhone 16 Ban, Officials Say\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) edged higher Thursday after reports indicated the company is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani told Bloomberg in Davos that he expects a resolution within one to two weeks.\n\nThe government had previously rejected Apple's $1 billion investment plan, which included an AirTag factory, saying it did not meet local content requirements for smartphone production. Indonesia first imposed the ban in October 2024, citing Apple's failure to meet investment thresholds. The company initially offered $100 million over two years, later increasing the bid to $1 billion.\n\nReports last month suggested President Prabowo Subianto approved the latest proposal, paving the way for a deal. Roeslani said the government and Apple are now working through differences in how local content is calculated and expressed confidence that an agreement will soon allow iPhone 16 sales to resume in the Southeast Asian market.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price.

The company had offered a $1 billion deal which included plans to invest locally and meet content requirements. This development seems to be positive for Apple's stock as it potentially removes a significant market barrier and improves relations with the Indonesian government. Several previous predictions from different models had a mixed view but generally leaned towards a positive impact on the stock price, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall.
