This news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is a technology company, and its stock price is primarily influenced by factors such as product sales, innovation, competition, and overall economic conditions. The previous rounds of predictions show a slight upward trend in the probability of the stock price rising, but the news itself is irrelevant.
