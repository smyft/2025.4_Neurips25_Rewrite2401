Being a major constituent of the index, Apple's performance can significantly influence the overall market. However, the news does not provide any direct, specific information about Apple's future performance or prospects. It merely indicates that AI stocks, including potentially Apple, are crucial to the S&P 500's composition and possibly its future movements. Given that the news is more about the composition of the S&P 500 rather than Apple's specific performance or prospects, and without direct negative or positive implications for Apple's stock price, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price might not be directly and significantly affected by this general information. The neutral tone of the news and the lack of specific details about Apple's future performance or changes in its business operations suggest that the stock price might not see a dramatic shift solely based on this information.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 28.8% of the Entire S&P 500 Index\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
