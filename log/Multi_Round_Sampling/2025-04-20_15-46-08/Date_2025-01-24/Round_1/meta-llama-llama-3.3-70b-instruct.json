However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned only as a reference to the type of phone, and there is no direct information about the company's financial performance or future prospects. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's financials, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a wide range of estimates, but most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, since the news is not directly related to Apple, I will estimate the probabilities based on the assumption that the news has minimal impact on the company's stock price.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Ola joins Uber, denies implementing phone model-based pricing in India\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}"
