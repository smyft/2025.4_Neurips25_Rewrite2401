This news does not directly relate to Apple's financial performance or operations. However, the fact that Apple users were allegedly charged higher prices could potentially impact Apple's brand reputation. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of decreasing probability of stock price rise and increasing probability of stock price fall. Nevertheless, the news itself does not seem to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.
