However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. or provide specific information that would impact Apple's stock price. Given that the overall market sentiment was positive, with US benchmark equity indexes ending higher, it might have a mildly positive effect on Apple's stock price. However, the lack of specific information about Apple Inc. in the news headline makes the impact uncertain. The previous predictions from various models show a general trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but with some variation. Considering the positive market sentiment but the absence of direct positive news about Apple, a cautious approach is warranted.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```"
