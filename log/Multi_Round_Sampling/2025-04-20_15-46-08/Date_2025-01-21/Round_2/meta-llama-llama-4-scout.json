This generally positive market movement suggests a favorable environment for stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the news does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. or its prospects. Given that the overall market trended upwards and without specific negative news about Apple, it's reasonable to assume a moderate positive outlook for AAPL stock price movement. The previous predictions show a variety of outlooks, but there is a slight leaning towards a negative outlook in the previous rounds. Considering the general positive trend of the market and the lack of specific negative information about AAPL, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48,\n}\n```"
