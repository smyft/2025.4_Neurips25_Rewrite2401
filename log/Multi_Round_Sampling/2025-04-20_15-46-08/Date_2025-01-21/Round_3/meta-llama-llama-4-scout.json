However, the news does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly influence its stock price. Given that the overall market sentiment was positive, with US benchmark equity indexes ending higher, it is reasonable to infer a slightly positive outlook for Apple Inc. as well, assuming it followed the general market trend. However, the lack of specific information about Apple Inc. in the news headline and content makes the prediction largely based on the general market movement. The previous predictions from various models show a predominantly negative outlook, with many models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. Considering the general positive market sentiment but also accounting for the lack of specific positive news about Apple, a cautious approach is warranted.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
