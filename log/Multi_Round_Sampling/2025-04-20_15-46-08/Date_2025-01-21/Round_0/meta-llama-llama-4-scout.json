While the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or its stock performance, it suggests a positive overall market trend. Given that Apple is a major player in the US equity market, it is likely that its stock price would also experience a positive movement in line with the general market trend. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to the event, the probabilities are not extreme.
