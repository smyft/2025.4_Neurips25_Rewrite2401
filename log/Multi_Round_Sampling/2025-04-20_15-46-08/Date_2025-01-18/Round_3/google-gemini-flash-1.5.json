      "content": "```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news headline 'Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks' is quite generic and provides little specific information about Apple.  It doesn't offer any insights into Apple's performance or future prospects. Therefore, the news itself is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price.  However, we must consider the previous predictions from various models.  While there's some variation, there's a slight tendency towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, particularly noticeable in models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and qwen/qwen-turbo.  These models consistently show a higher probability of a price rise across all rounds.  The other models show more fluctuation, but the overall average leans slightly towards a rise.  Considering the lack of impactful news and the trend in previous predictions, I'll weight my prediction slightly towards a rise, but acknowledge the uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
