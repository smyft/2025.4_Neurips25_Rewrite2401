However, the article implies that this lack of innovation may not significantly impact Apple's stock performance in the long term. Investors often focus on fundamentals and overall market conditions rather than short-term critiques. Therefore, while there may be some downward pressure on the stock due to the negative sentiment, the overall impact might be mitigated by Apple's strong market position and financial health.
