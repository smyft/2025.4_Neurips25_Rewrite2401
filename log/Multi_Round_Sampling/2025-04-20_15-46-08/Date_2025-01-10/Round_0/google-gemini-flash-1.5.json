While this is positive sentiment, the news lacks specifics about Apple's weighting within that portfolio or any new investment activity.  The headline is also quite general and lacks concrete information to support a strong prediction of price movement.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term. The probability of a price rise is slightly higher due to the positive association with Buffett, but the lack of detail significantly limits the impact of this news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
