(AAPL), as it primarily concerns TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance. However, there could be indirect implications for Apple, such as potential impacts on the App Store revenue if TikTok is removed. Given the lack of direct relevance, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to uncertainty. The previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the mixed signals from previous predictions, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect slight uncertainty with a neutral to slightly negative bias.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"TikTok Ban at the Supreme Court: Here\u2019s What to Know\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
