(AAPL). However, given that AAPL is a well-known and widely held stock, we can infer that the news might have an indirect impact on investor sentiment towards AAPL. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed trend, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of it falling. Considering that the news does not provide direct information about AAPL, we should focus on the overall sentiment and trends from previous predictions. The recent predictions have been more conservative, with many models suggesting a slight inclination towards the stock price rising or falling with nearly equal probabilities. Given this context, I estimate that the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but still within a narrow range.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```"
