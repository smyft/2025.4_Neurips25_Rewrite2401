This could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance or a shift in investment strategy towards high-growth AI sectors. The previous predictions from Round 0 to Round 1 show a general trend of decreasing confidence in Apple's stock price rising, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. The consensus seems to lean towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to this news. Considering the shift in sentiment and the high-profile nature of the investor's actions, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to the stock price falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
