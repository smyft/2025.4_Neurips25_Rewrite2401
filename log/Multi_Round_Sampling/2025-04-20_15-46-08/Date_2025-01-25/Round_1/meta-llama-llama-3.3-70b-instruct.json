The report will likely include information about the company's performance, revenue, and future outlook, which can influence investor sentiment. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision can also impact the stock market. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a mixed sentiment about the stock price movement. However, since the news is about the earnings report and the Fed's rate decision, which are significant events, I will take a more neutral stance. The probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on the actual earnings report and the Fed's decision, which are unknown at this point. Therefore, I will assign a probability of 0.5 for both rising and falling, indicating a neutral sentiment.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}"
