This is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Previous predictions from various models show a consistent trend of predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.8 for falling. The most recent round of predictions maintains this trend, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given these factors, it is reasonable to predict a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst.
