The overall tone of the article is neutral, and there is no specific information that suggests a significant positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the fact that Apple's earnings report is upcoming and the interest rate decision can impact the overall market sentiment, I will consider the predictions of other models. The predictions of other models show a trend of slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, which may indicate that they have some negative information about the stock. Considering this, I will estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.6.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
