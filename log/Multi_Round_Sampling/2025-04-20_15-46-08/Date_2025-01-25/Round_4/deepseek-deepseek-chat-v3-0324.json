      "content": "```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI stock, which has seen a 500% increase in less than 3 years. This could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance or a strategic shift towards high-growth AI investments. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a clear trend of increasing pessimism towards Apple's stock price, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. The consensus in Round 3 shows probabilities of falling ranging from 0.58 to 0.75, with only one model (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) slightly more balanced at 0.42 rise vs. 0.58 fall. Given this trend and the negative sentiment implied by Cohen's sale, it is reasonable to align with the majority view of a higher probability of the stock price falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```"
