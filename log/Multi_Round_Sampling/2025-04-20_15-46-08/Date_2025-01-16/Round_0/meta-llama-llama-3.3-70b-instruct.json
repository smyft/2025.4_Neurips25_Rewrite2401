This could be perceived as a positive development for the company, as the metaverse is a growing and potentially lucrative market. Apple's involvement in the metaverse could lead to new revenue streams, innovative products, and enhanced brand reputation. However, without more specific information about the nature and scope of Apple's investment, it's difficult to predict the exact impact on the stock price. Generally, investing in emerging technologies like the metaverse can be seen as a strategic move, potentially attracting investors and boosting stock prices.
