(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\nNews Content: This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) : Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a successful technology fund suggests a positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires indicates a preference for stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading, which could bode well for established companies like Apple. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, while there is a positive sentiment, the lack of immediate triggers leads to a moderate probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings due to overvaluation and potential tax increases is a negative signal. His shift towards Domino's, a value stock, further reinforces this concern. Geopolitical risks and antitrust issues also weigh on Apple's near-term prospects. However, upcoming product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4) and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential for revenue and earnings growth. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue growth and EPS for 2026 provides a positive counterpoint. Considering these factors, the negative signals from Buffett's actions and the overvaluation concerns slightly outweigh the positive catalysts, leading to a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a prediction of Apple reaching a $4 trillion valuation by 2025,  a prediction unrelated to any specific news about Apple itself. The article's title highlights skepticism towards this prediction.  The core information is that Apple is Warren Buffett's largest holding and is close to a $4 trillion valuation. While a $4 trillion valuation implies significant future growth, the news itself doesn't provide any new information about Apple's performance or prospects that would directly cause a stock price movement.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this news alone is low.  Market movements are influenced by many factors beyond this single news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the broader AI PC market. Cramer highlighted concerns about consumer demand for AI PCs, noting that a Morgan Stanley survey indicated weak consumer interest in paying extra for AI features. While Cramer remains bullish on enterprise AI applications, his skepticism about the consumer AI PC super cycle could negatively impact sentiment around Apple, given its reliance on consumer electronics. Additionally, the mention of Apple's iPhone struggling in China adds to the negative sentiment. However, Cramer also downplays the impact of consensus estimates, suggesting that the market may already be pricing in some negative expectations. Overall, the negative aspects of the news outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and its potential impact on the stock price. Apple's stock has had a rough start in 2025, down 8% and underperforming the S&P 500. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include Apple's China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales, particularly the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. Given the mixed expectations and the stock's recent underperformance, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple. Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, the Services segment missed revenue expectations. Despite this mixed quarter, the stock is up 2% since the results. Considering the overall positive trend in the consumer electronics sector and Apple's ability to top operating income expectations, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not contain specific information related to Apple Inc. It appears to be a general query or title, likely referring to an article or report detailing Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Without additional context or details about Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple, it is impossible to determine how this news would affect Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
