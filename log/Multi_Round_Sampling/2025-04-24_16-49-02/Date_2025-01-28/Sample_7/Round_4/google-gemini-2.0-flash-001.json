(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\nNews Content: Over 26% of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is invested in Apple stock, which he has owned since 2016 and is still his largest holding; however, he has sold over 615 million shares of Apple in the past four quarters.\n\nOvervalued and Tax Concerns\n\nApple has traditionally been a high-flying quality stock with a vast moat, an exemplary capital allocation strategy, and a tactical product rollout. Still, the stock has been heavily overvalued since late 2023, with a current value hovering around 20% over GuruFocus's calculated fair market value of $189.29. Furthermore, Buffett's nearly 25% share reduction during September was more likely due to tax considerations. During the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Buffett stated that he expected future tax rates to rise.\n\nTentative with Technology\n\nAnother reason for selling may be that Buffett is less comfortable with technology companies than his late partner, Charlie Munger, as Berkshire started offloading shares shortly after Charlie passed away in November 2023. Before his passing, Munger emphasized the importance of owning stocks like Apple and Alphabet, acknowledging their dominance and consistent outperformance in the market.\n\nDominos Investment\n\nBuffett's Apple sales have generated nearly $25 billion, giving Berkshire Hathaway a large cash pile for other investments. Fifty-five million of that cash has been invested in high-quality Domino's Pizza, representing approximately 3.7% of company shares. This solid-value, non-technology franchise business may appeal more to Buffett than his existing overinflated Apple stock. The stock is trading slightly below Guru Focus's fair market value estimate of $428.28, with an overall score of 92 and a profitability rank of 10 out of 10. Domino's share price is expected to rise approximately 10% in the next 12 months versus Apple's, which is predicted to increase by less than 1%. Domino's fortressing strategy, global master franchise agreements, Pulse POS system, and recently upgraded customer loyalty program have helped the company expand globally and drive domestic carryout traffic. The company is the prominent market leader in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) pizza business and outperformed Papa John's and Pizza Hut (owned by Yum Brands) in 2024. The company has an impressive 56% ROIC, contrasting sharply with a meager 9.95% WACC, suggesting the company is effectively allocating capital and accreting value despite a heavy debt burden.\n\nDomino's debt burden is reflected in the company's long history of negative debt-to-equity and equity-to-asset ratios. However, these metrics align with Papa John's and Yum Brands in this competitive, capital-intensive industry. With its huge cash pile, Berkshire Hathaway's interest in the company may help alleviate investor concerns. Domino's paid investors a $1.51 per share dividend in September and has had a 20% dividend growth rate over the last 10 years. That policy may be questionable, given their negative equity history.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nDPZ Data by GuruFocus\n\nHere's how Domino's metrics currently stack up with competitors (Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Domino's Pizza Inc Yum Brands Inc (Pizza Hut) Papa John's International Inc Symbol DPZ YUM PZZA Industry Restaurants Restaurants Restaurants GF Score 92 87 74 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Wide Narrow Predictability Rank 4/10 1/10 1/10 GF Value Rank 7/10 9/10 4/10 GF Valuation  Fairly Valued Modestly Undervalued Significantly Undervalued Profitability Rank 10/10 9/10 8/10 Financial Strength 4/10 4/10 4/10 Growth Rank 9/10 7/10 5/10 GF Value 429.80 144.33 79.35 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 443.84 0.00 0.00 Price Target 483.07 144.17 57.73 Revenue 4,665.47 7,223.00 2,099.94 PE Ratio 26.27 23.42 12.50 PEG Ratio 2.07 4.36 0.61 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 27.96 28.81 16.89 PB Ratio 0.00 0.00 0.00 PS Ratio 3.22 4.94 0.56 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 30.09 26.10 23.93 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 24.37 21.96 9.69 EV-to-EBITDA 20.00 18.28 8.91 Debt-to-Equity -1.31 -1.46 -2.23 Interest Coverage 4.41 4.74 3.11 Current Ratio 1.71 1.37 0.80 ROIC % 56.18 39.80 15.10 WACC % 10.06 7.66 7.66 Gross Margin % 39.05 48.57 20.25 Operating Margin % 18.49 32.19 6.58 Net Margin % 12.26 21.13 4.51 ROE % Negative Equity Negative Equity Negative Equity ROA % 32.99 24.31 11.02 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate 5.50 13.30 14.10 Dividends per Share (TTM)  5.74 2.62 1.84 Dividend Yield % 1.41 2.14 5.11 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.35 0.51 0.70 FCF Yield % 3.38 3.91 4.20 Buyback Yield % 1.85 0.93 0.00\n\nApple's Short and Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple's stock rose more than 30% in 2024 and is trading at all-time highs. Many fear the stock may lose momentum, as reflected in Guru Focus's flat share price target for the next 12 months. However, Apple investors might not want to unload their stock just yet.\n\nNear-term prospects are mixed due to geopolitical risks related to Apple's supply chain in China and Taiwan. With Trump's return to office, we might see a continuation of his previous trade policies, which previously have included tariffs on Chinese products and stricter enforcement of trade agreements.\n\nApple also has antitrust concerns. Since Google is the default search engine on Safari, Apple has taken an interest in the Department of Justice versus Google case, which may negatively impact Apple's ability to provide premium products to users. Weakened consumer spending may exacerbate these problems.\n\nHowever, the release of the new iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 holds some promise that the stock may maintain a similar 2024 trajectory, including record revenues of 9.4 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase, and a 12% earnings increase. Apple is also developing a proprietary cellular modem, expected to roll out in 2025, starting with the iPhone SE and even eventually moving to premium models by 2027. This vertical integration strategy is expected to drive margin expansion.\n\nWith the adoption of Apple Intelligence, Apple's latest artificial intelligence system, introduced at the company's tradeshow, Worldwide Developers Conference 2024, dedicated Apple users are expected to upgrade their current iPhone models in 2026. The company is also expected to have an 11.4% compounded annual growth rate in service revenue through fiscal year 2027. For these reasons, Morgan Stanley forecasts a 12.3% revenue growth and earnings per share of $8.52 for 2026.\n\nThe Stalwart Parent\n\nCautious investors can't go wrong with Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway shows moderate short-term gain potential with strong financial health and profitability metrics. Net margin, return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital indicate strong financial health compared to the S&P 500. The company had a record $325.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q3 2024, up from $276.9 billion at the end of June 2024. Berkshire Hathaway A and B shares are priced slightly above Guru Focus's calculated values. Investment income trends for the company remain strong due to increased bond reinvestment rates and Berkshire also exhibits attractive long-term prospects due to consistent revenue and net income growth, improved financial health, and a diversified business model. Berkshire Hathaway is expected to earn over $23.00 per share by 2027 through 2029 and may also continue to benefit from strategic acquisitions.\n\nHowever, there are a few cracks in the armor. Operating earnings were $4.68 per share in the third quarter of 2024, a decline due to decreased underwriting income from industrywide catastrophes. The company has a history of rising debt and inconsistent per-share cash flow within the last 5 years.What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nBRK.A Data by GuruFocus\n\nIn November 2024, CFRA downgraded its rating on Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares from 'Buy' to 'Hold,' attributing the decision to lower EPS estimates and revenue forecasts caused by widespread declines in operating revenues and insurance premiums.\n\nMorningstar lowered Berkshire Hathaway's moat rating from wide to narrow due to several factors. They observed signs of slippage in the railroad business and increased litigation exposure for the utilities/energy business, which have put downward pressure on excess returns for the noninsurance operations. Moreover, following Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s inevitable departure, the company will likely find it challenging to replicate the historic advantages he provided, making it harder for Berkshire to achieve superior returns consistently over the next decade.\n\nBelow is a comparison of significant metrics for the three main companies discussed in this report (BRK.A & BRK.B refer to the same company but have slightly different metrics due to market fluctuations; Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Apple Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Domino's Pizza Inc Symbol AAPL BRK.A BRK.B DPZ Industry Hardware Insurance Insurance Restaurants GF Score 96 72 69 92 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Narrow Narrow Wide Predictability Rank 5 Stars 1 Star 1 Star 4 Stars GF Value Rank 5/10 5/10 3/10 7/10 GF Valuation Modestly Overvalued Modestly Overvalued Significantly Overvalued Fairly Valued Profitability Rank 10/10 6/10 6/10 10/10 Financial Strength 6/10 7/10 7/10 4/10 Growth Rank 10/10 2/10 2/10 9/10 GF Value 189.76 564,060.75 353.49 429.80 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 144.50 0.00 0.00 443.84 Price Target 243.60 762,340.33 513.00 483.07 Revenue 391,035.00 452,954.00 452,954.00 4,665.47 PE Ratio 37.83 9.47 9.47 26.27 PEG Ratio 2.14 0.00 0.00 2.07 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 34.94 8.78 8.78 27.96 PB Ratio 61.05 1.61 1.61 0.00 PS Ratio 9.07 2.23 2.23 3.22 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 32.60 48.11 48.11 30.09 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 30.00 25.06 25.06 24.37 EV-to-EBITDA 25.99 7.28 7.28 20.00 Debt-to-Equity 1.87 0.20 0.20 -1.31 Interest Coverage N/A 27.47 27.47 4.41 Current Ratio 0.87 0.00 0.00 1.71 ROIC % 32.51 10.65 10.65 56.18 WACC %  11.41 9.07 9.07 10.06 Gross Margin % 46.21 0.00 0.00 39.05 Operating Margin % 31.51 0.00 0.00 18.49 Net Margin % 23.97 23.60 23.60 12.26 ROE %  140.28 18.50 18.50 Negative Equity ROA % 26.93 9.87 9.87 32.99 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate  3.00 25.10 25.10 5.50 Dividends per Share (TTM)  0.98 0.00 0.00 5.74 Dividend Yield % 0.43 0.00 0.00 1.41 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.15 0.00 0.00 0.35 FCF Yield % 3.15 2.08 2.08 3.38 Buyback Yield % 2.75 0.51 0.51 1.85\n\nGiven the current metrics of these three companies, Domino's appears to be the best value investment for those seeking a balance of growth potential and dividend yield. It is fairly valued with a significant expected price increase and offers a high dividend yield. Still, prospective investors should be wary of the company's high debt levels and negative equity.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is the clear winner for more risk-averse investors. The company has low PE and EV/EBITDA ratios and a nearly 70% margin of safety based on GuruFocus's discounted cash flow model. Still, these calculations may be highly unpredictable due to the company's narrowing moat, challenges in capital allocation, and inevitable leadership transition.\n\nTake-Aways\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway significantly reduced its Apple holdings, selling over 615 million shares due to concerns about Apple's overvaluation and future tax rates. This shift reflects Buffett's cautious stance on technology stocks following the passing of his partner, Charlie Munger.\n\nThe proceeds from these sales have been partially reinvested in Domino's Pizza, a high-quality, non-technology franchise that aligns more closely with Buffett's investment philosophy.\n\nDespite Apple's strong performance and promising product rollouts, its overvaluation and geopolitical risks present challenges. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway faces headwinds such as decreased underwriting income, rising debt, and a narrowing moat, compounded by the impending leadership transition post-Buffett. Domino's Pizza emerges as a compelling value investment, offering a balance of growth potential and dividend yield despite its high debt levels.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a successful technology fund suggests a positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires indicates a preference for stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading, which could bode well for established companies like Apple. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, while there is a positive sentiment, the lack of immediate triggers leads to a moderate probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings due to overvaluation and potential tax increases is a negative signal. His shift towards Domino's, a value stock, further reinforces this concern. Geopolitical risks and antitrust issues also weigh on Apple's near-term prospects. However, upcoming product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4) and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential for revenue and earnings growth. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue growth and EPS for 2026 provides a positive counterpoint. Considering these factors, the negative signals from Buffett's actions and the overvaluation concerns slightly outweigh the positive catalysts, leading to a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a prediction of Apple reaching a $4 trillion valuation by 2025,  a prediction unrelated to any specific news about Apple itself. The article's title highlights skepticism towards this prediction.  The core information is that Apple is Warren Buffett's largest holding and is close to a $4 trillion valuation. While a $4 trillion valuation implies significant future growth, the news itself doesn't provide any new information about Apple's performance or prospects that would directly cause a stock price movement.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this news alone is low.  Market movements are influenced by many factors beyond this single news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the broader AI PC market. Cramer highlighted concerns about consumer demand for AI PCs, noting that a Morgan Stanley survey indicated weak consumer interest in paying extra for AI features. While Cramer remains bullish on enterprise AI applications, his skepticism about the consumer AI PC super cycle could negatively impact sentiment around Apple, given its reliance on consumer electronics. Additionally, the mention of Apple's iPhone struggling in China adds to the negative sentiment. However, Cramer also downplays the impact of consensus estimates, suggesting that the market may already be pricing in some negative expectations. Overall, the negative aspects of the news outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and its potential impact on the stock price. Apple's stock has had a rough start in 2025, down 8% and underperforming the S&P 500. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include Apple's China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales, particularly the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. Given the mixed expectations and the stock's recent underperformance, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple. Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, the Services segment missed revenue expectations. Despite this mixed quarter, the stock is up 2% since the results. Considering the overall positive trend in the consumer electronics sector and Apple's ability to top operating income expectations, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not contain specific information related to Apple Inc. It appears to be a general query or title, likely referring to an article or report detailing Berkshire Hathaway's holdings.

The overall trend of ISA millionaires indicates a preference for reliable investments, which may support a positive outlook for Apple. Therefore, while there are some negative signals, the general trend of increased investment in blue-chip stocks leads to a higher probability of price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects. Some models highlight positive factors like potential product releases and revenue growth, while others emphasize concerns about overvaluation, geopolitical risks, and weakening consumer demand.  Given the lack of concrete news directly affecting Apple and the conflicting predictions, I assign a near-even probability to both price rise and fall.  The long-term $4 trillion valuation prediction is too far out to significantly influence short-term probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

Geopolitical risks, potential antitrust issues, and weakened consumer spending add to the downside pressure. However, upcoming product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4) and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential for revenue and earnings growth. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue growth and EPS for 2026 provides a positive counterpoint.

The previous predictions from various models present a mixed outlook, with some models showing a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the lack of direct information about Apple's performance or specific events, the news itself is unlikely to strongly influence the stock price direction.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. This suggests a positive sentiment towards stable, long-term investments, which could bode well for established companies like Apple. However, there are mixed signals from previous predictions, with some analysts citing concerns about overvaluation and geopolitical risks. The overall trend of ISA millionaires indicates a preference for reliable investments, which may support a positive outlook for Apple. Therefore, while there are some negative signals, the general trend of increased investment in blue-chip stocks leads to a higher probability of price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Warren Buffett's reduction in Apple holdings due to overvaluation and potential tax increases is a significant negative signal, reinforced by his investment in Domino's. Geopolitical risks, antitrust issues, and potential weakening consumer spending add to the downside pressure. However, upcoming product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4) and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential for revenue and earnings growth. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue growth and EPS for 2026 provides a positive counterpoint. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight leaning towards a negative outlook. I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect this balance, giving slightly more weight to the negative factors due to Buffett's actions and overvaluation concerns. The fact that Buffett is moving to Domino's, a value stock, is a strong signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a long-term prediction of Apple's valuation, not on any immediate news impacting its stock price.  The article itself expresses skepticism towards this $4 trillion valuation by 2025. While Apple's status as Warren Buffett's largest holding is positive, the news lacks specific short-term catalysts.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.  Some models highlight positive factors like potential product releases and revenue growth, while others emphasize concerns about overvaluation, geopolitical risks, and weakening consumer demand.  The lack of concrete news directly affecting Apple and the conflicting predictions lead to a near-even probability assignment for both price rise and fall.  The long-term valuation prediction is too distant to significantly influence short-term probabilities.  However, the slight trend towards a higher probability of a price fall in later rounds suggests a cautious outlook.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the mixed signals, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on concerns around consumer demand for AI PCs and the broader AI market. Cramer highlights a lack of evidence for a super-cycle in AI PCs, which could negatively impact Apple given its reliance on consumer electronics. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's struggles in China and the lack of immediate positive catalysts. While Cramer remains optimistic about enterprise AI, his skepticism about consumer AI PCs and the overall negative sentiment around Apple's near-term prospects suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Previous predictions also lean towards a negative outlook, with most models giving a higher probability of a price fall. However, the stock's current underperformance and mixed expectations from analysts indicate that the downside risk is somewhat priced in, leading to a slightly less negative outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report, highlighting its rough start in 2025 with an 8% decline and underperformance relative to the S&P 500. Earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with expected 8% growth in EPS and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include Apple's China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales, particularly the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. Given the mixed expectations and the stock's recent underperformance, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising. However, the first positive year-over-year change in China sales in several quarters and robust Services results could provide some support. Analyzing the diverse predictions from previous models, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple. Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, the Services segment missed revenue expectations. Despite this mixed quarter, the stock is up 2% since the results. Considering the overall positive trend in the consumer electronics sector and Apple's ability to top operating income expectations, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but the most recent ones tend to have a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. Given the mixed results and the slight increase in stock price post-earnings, it's reasonable to estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not provide specific information related to Apple Inc., making it difficult to determine the direct impact on the stock price. The previous predictions from various models present a mixed outlook, with some models showing a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling.
