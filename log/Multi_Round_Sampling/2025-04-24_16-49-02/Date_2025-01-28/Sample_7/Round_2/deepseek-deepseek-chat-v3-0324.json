(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a successful technology fund suggests a positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires indicates a preference for stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading, which could bode well for established companies like Apple. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, while there is a positive sentiment, the lack of immediate triggers leads to a moderate probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings due to overvaluation and potential tax increases is a negative signal. His shift towards Domino's, a value stock, further reinforces this concern. Geopolitical risks and antitrust issues also weigh on Apple's near-term prospects. However, upcoming product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4) and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential for revenue and earnings growth. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue growth and EPS for 2026 provides a positive counterpoint. Considering these factors, the negative signals from Buffett's actions and the overvaluation concerns slightly outweigh the positive catalysts, leading to a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a prediction of Apple reaching a $4 trillion valuation by 2025,  a prediction unrelated to any specific news about Apple itself. The article's title highlights skepticism towards this prediction.  The core information is that Apple is Warren Buffett's largest holding and is close to a $4 trillion valuation. While a $4 trillion valuation implies significant future growth, the news itself doesn't provide any new information about Apple's performance or prospects that would directly cause a stock price movement.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this news alone is low.  Market movements are influenced by many factors beyond this single news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the broader AI PC market. Cramer highlighted concerns about consumer demand for AI PCs, noting that a Morgan Stanley survey indicated weak consumer interest in paying extra for AI features. While Cramer remains bullish on enterprise AI applications, his skepticism about the consumer AI PC super cycle could negatively impact sentiment around Apple, given its reliance on consumer electronics. Additionally, the mention of Apple's iPhone struggling in China adds to the negative sentiment. However, Cramer also downplays the impact of consensus estimates, suggesting that the market may already be pricing in some negative expectations. Overall, the negative aspects of the news outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and its potential impact on the stock price. Apple's stock has had a rough start in 2025, down 8% and underperforming the S&P 500. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include Apple's China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales, particularly the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. Given the mixed expectations and the stock's recent underperformance, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple. Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, the Services segment missed revenue expectations. Despite this mixed quarter, the stock is up 2% since the results. Considering the overall positive trend in the consumer electronics sector and Apple's ability to top operating income expectations, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not contain specific information related to Apple Inc. It appears to be a general query or title, likely referring to an article or report detailing Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Without additional context or details about Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple, it is impossible to determine how this news would affect Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. This suggests a positive sentiment towards stable, long-term investments, which could bode well for established companies like Apple. However, there are mixed signals from previous predictions, with some analysts citing concerns about overvaluation and geopolitical risks. The overall trend of ISA millionaires indicates a preference for reliable investments, which may support a positive outlook for Apple. Therefore, while there are some negative signals, the general trend of increased investment in blue-chip stocks leads to a higher probability of price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings due to overvaluation and potential tax increases is a negative signal. His shift towards Domino's, a value stock, further reinforces this concern.

However, upcoming product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4) and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential for revenue and earnings growth. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue growth and EPS for 2026 provides a positive counterpoint. Considering these factors, the negative signals from Buffett's actions and the overvaluation concerns slightly outweigh the positive catalysts, leading to a higher probability of a price fall. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, the models are quite diverse in their predictions. I will stick to my original assessment and slightly adjust the probabilities based on the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a prediction of Apple reaching a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, a long-term prediction unrelated to any immediate news impacting Apple's stock price.  The article itself expresses skepticism towards this prediction. While Apple's position as Warren Buffett's largest holding is positive, the news lacks specific catalysts for short-term price movement.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects. Some models highlight positive factors like potential product releases and revenue growth, while others emphasize concerns about overvaluation, geopolitical risks, and weakening consumer demand.  Given the lack of concrete news directly affecting Apple and the conflicting predictions, I assign a near-even probability to both price rise and fall.  The long-term $4 trillion valuation prediction is too far out to significantly influence short-term probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding concerns about consumer demand for AI PCs and the broader AI market. Cramer highlights a lack of evidence for a super-cycle in AI PCs, which could negatively impact Apple given its consumer electronics focus. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's struggles in China and the lack of immediate positive catalysts. While Cramer remains optimistic about enterprise AI, his skepticism about consumer AI PCs and the overall negative sentiment around Apple's near-term prospects suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Previous predictions also lean towards a negative outlook, with most models giving a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report, highlighting that the stock has had a rough start in 2025, down 8% and underperforming the S&P 500.

The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. Given the mixed expectations and the stock's recent underperformance, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising. However, the first positive year-over-year change in China sales in several quarters and robust Services results could provide some support.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple.

Considering the overall positive trend in the consumer electronics sector and Apple's ability to top operating income expectations, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but the most recent ones tend to have a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not contain specific information related to Apple Inc. It appears to be a general query or title, likely referring to an article or report detailing Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. There is no direct information about Apple's performance or any specific events that would influence its stock price. Given the lack of specific information about Apple and considering the mixed views expressed in previous predictions, it is reasonable to assume that the news itself does not strongly indicate a significant price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
