(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\nNews Content: Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model than its other Big Tech rivals who have invested heavily in building out their AI capabilities, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts argued that the iPhone maker, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on [large language models] or infrastructure\".\n\nAlthough the company is continuing to roll out its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service in its latest iPhone offerings, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is \"limited\", the analysts said. Indeed, longer term, expanding generative AI capabilities could catalyze a \"better cycle\" of product upgrades, they noted.\n\nDeepSeek, a small Chinese start-up, roiled global stock markets on Monday after it introduced a free chatbot it says can compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant, which is run on the model, became the top-rated app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said the company represented a \"wake-up call\" for America's tech giants.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\nApple is due to report its December quarter results after the closing bell on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\n\nNextEra Energy's XPLR Infrastructure shares tank on dividend suspension\n\nS&P, Nasdaq eye higher open as AI stocks recover, earnings roll in\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple, as it reports that the iPhone was the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which could boost investor sentiment. However, there are concerns about the overall market share decline and a significant drop in device sales compared to the previous year. The mixed signals from the market share data and the commentary from analysts about Apple's valuation being high may temper enthusiasm. Therefore, while there is a positive catalyst, the overall sentiment may be cautious, leading to a moderate probability of price rise and a notable probability of price fall due to the negative sales trend.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report overall revenue and EPS growth, driven by Services and Mac sales, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competition in China. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests negative sentiment. The underperformance of AAPL shares compared to the sector and the stretched valuation are also negative signals. However, the positive aspects include the AI push with Apple Intelligence and the growth in the Services segment. Considering these factors, the negative aspects seem to outweigh the positives in the short term, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, including Apple. While Apple's revenue slightly exceeded expectations, its Services segment missed targets.  The article notes the stock is up 2% since the results, suggesting the market reacted positively despite the mixed performance.  However, the overall news is not specifically about Apple and focuses more broadly on the consumer electronics sector. The macroeconomic context mentions positive market trends due to rate cuts and the election of Donald Trump, which could positively influence Apple's stock price irrespective of the Q3 earnings report.  Given the mixed Q3 results and the broader positive market sentiment, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the impact of this specific news is relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns over the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, to U.S. tech giants, including Apple. The article suggests that DeepSeek's cheaper and competitive AI model could challenge the dominance of U.S. hyperscalers in AI, potentially impacting future earnings growth for companies like Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings have been a key driver of the bull market, any threat to its earnings growth could negatively affect its stock price. Additionally, the broader market reaction on Monday, with a significant drop in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, indicates investor concern over tech earnings. This suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the near term due to these concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's stock price movement is uncertain due to mixed factors. The company's expected revenue growth of 3.73% year over year, and an estimated 8.26% increase in earnings per share, are positive indicators. However, iPhone sales are likely to fall due to stiff competition in China, and a delay in Apple Intelligence launch has been a concern. Additionally, the stock has a stretched valuation, indicated by a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and a high forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 28.97X. Despite these factors, Apple's AI push and growth in Services segment are expected to drive prospects. Considering these factors, we estimate a slightly positive movement in the stock price due to steady growth in Services and Mac sales, but potential risks due to competition in China and valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, the Services segment missed revenue expectations. Despite this mixed quarter, the stock is up 2% since the results. Considering the overall positive trend in the consumer electronics sector and Apple's strong brand loyalty and pricing power, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. However, the uncertainty surrounding future rate cuts and trade policy changes may impact the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple, as it reports that the iPhone was the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which could boost investor sentiment. However, there are concerns about the overall market share decline and a significant drop in device sales compared to the previous year. The mixed signals from the market share data and the commentary from analysts about Apple's valuation being high may temper enthusiasm. While the recent price action shows a slight recovery, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the competitive landscape in China and the potential for further declines in market share. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of price rise and a notable probability of price fall due to the negative sales trend and valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On the positive side, Apple expects revenue growth, earnings are projected to increase, and the Services segment is expected to continue its double-digit growth. Mac sales are also expected to rise. Apple's AI push with Apple Intelligence is a long-term positive. However, iPhone sales are expected to decline due to competition in China, and the company faces a stretched valuation. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates negative sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight shift towards a more negative outlook. The negative aspects seem to outweigh the positives in the short term, but the AI push and Services growth provide some support. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, with Apple mentioned as having a mixed quarter. While Apple exceeded revenue expectations slightly and saw operating income surpass predictions, its Services segment underperformed.  The stock is reported to be up 2% since the earnings announcement, suggesting a positive market reaction despite the mixed results.  However, the article's primary focus is not on Apple, but rather a broader overview of the consumer electronics sector. The macroeconomic context, including rate cuts and the election of Donald Trump, introduces significant uncertainty and potential for broader market influences on Apple's stock price.  Considering the mixed Q3 results, the positive market reaction, and the significant macroeconomic uncertainties, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the impact of this specific news is relatively low.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement.  My prediction leans towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the positive market reaction, but acknowledges the significant external factors that could easily shift the balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a competitive threat from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, which has sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, particularly affecting tech giants like Apple. The concern is that DeepSeek's cheaper and more efficient AI model could challenge the dominance of U.S. hyperscalers in AI, potentially impacting future earnings growth for companies like Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings have been a key driver of the bull market, any threat to its earnings growth could negatively affect its stock price. The broader market reaction, with significant drops in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, indicates investor concern over tech earnings. This suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the near term due to these concerns. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified product portfolio may provide some resilience, but the immediate impact of the news is likely negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings report, expectations of low to mid-single digit revenue growth, and specific segment performances. iPhone sales are expected to decline due to competition in China, while Services and Mac sales are anticipated to grow. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and a stretched valuation. Considering these mixed factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to growth in Services and Mac sales, but risks remain due to competition and valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple. Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, the Services segment missed revenue expectations. Despite this mixed quarter, the stock is up 2% since the results. Considering the overall positive trend in the consumer electronics sector and Apple's strong brand loyalty and pricing power, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. However, the uncertainty surrounding future rate cuts and trade policy changes may impact the stock price. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price fall due to concerns over competition, valuation, and earnings growth, while others predict a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to steady growth in Services and Mac sales.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple is less exposed to the competitive threat from DeepSeek's AI model compared to its peers. Analysts at Baird suggest that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without significant investment in large language models or infrastructure, potentially catalyzing better cycles of product upgrades. These points are supportive of Apple's stock price. However, there is still caution due to the overall market sentiment around AI and the mixed historical performance of Apple\u2019s stock, particularly in terms of iPhone sales in China.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
