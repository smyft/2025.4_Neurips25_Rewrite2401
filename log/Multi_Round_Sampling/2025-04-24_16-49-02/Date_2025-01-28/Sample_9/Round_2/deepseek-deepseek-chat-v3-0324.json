(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why DeepSeek has been so unsettling for the stock market in 3 charts\nNews Content: A cheaper, competitive AI model from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) on Monday as it challenged one of the key drivers of the current bull market.\n\nFor the first time in a while, investors had a tangible reason to believe some US tech giants, namely Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), might not grow earnings by as much as initially hoped in the coming year. The team behind DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence model maker, claimed that the technology uses cheaper chips and less data. Investors are concerned this could hurt future AI chip sales for a company like Nvidia as well as bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI.\n\nThe problem for markets is that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years.\n\n\"The key pillar of this bull market is earning estimates moving higher,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \"Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year.\"\n\nAs Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, Big Tech earnings from the giants \u2014 Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 have seen earnings estimates rise more than the rest of the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe (IEUR) index over the past 12 months.\n\nYesterday's more than 3% decline in the Nasdaq and 1.5% drop in the S&P 500 show how the market could react if both the blue (Big Tech earnings estimates) and green lines (the rest of S&P 500 estimates) in Krishna's chart below begin reversing direction.\n\nThe expected scrutiny over tech earnings will come amid a market that Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told Yahoo Finance is ripe for change. Bernstein'scontribution to Yahoo Finance's Chartbook showed how just 29% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024 and 30% outperformed in 2023. This marked the lowest number of outperformers since the late 1990s.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably incorrect that there is a new paradigm in which the 'Magnificent Seven' secularly dominate the market,\" Bernstein said. \"Such extreme, narrow leadership is rare because it goes against capitalism, open markets, and competition.\"\n\n\"We think 2025 [will] be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBernstein's call for broader returns in 2025 matches the takeaway from a chart shared with Yahoo Finance by Nicole Inui, HSBC's head of equity research for the Americas. Inui's chart shows that while Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow more than the other 493 stocks in the index in 2025, the gap is expected to narrow, making the case for a broadening of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Mag 7, while still outpacing the overall index on earnings growth, is expected to be less of an outlier.\"\n\nTo both Bernstein and Inui's credit, that market action played out on Monday. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Nvidia's large losses led to most of the downside action in the overall index.\n\nThis introduces a stark reality for investors. Should Big Tech's dominance wane, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500. But it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Jan. 15, 2025, in New York City.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple, as it reports that the iPhone was the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which could boost investor sentiment. However, there are concerns about the overall market share decline and a significant drop in device sales compared to the previous year. The mixed signals from the market share data and the commentary from analysts about Apple's valuation being high may temper enthusiasm. Therefore, while there is a positive catalyst, the overall sentiment may be cautious, leading to a moderate probability of price rise and a notable probability of price fall due to the negative sales trend.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report overall revenue and EPS growth, driven by Services and Mac sales, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competition in China. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests negative sentiment. The underperformance of AAPL shares compared to the sector and the stretched valuation are also negative signals. However, the positive aspects include the AI push with Apple Intelligence and the growth in the Services segment. Considering these factors, the negative aspects seem to outweigh the positives in the short term, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, including Apple. While Apple's revenue slightly exceeded expectations, its Services segment missed targets.  The article notes the stock is up 2% since the results, suggesting the market reacted positively despite the mixed performance.  However, the overall news is not specifically about Apple and focuses more broadly on the consumer electronics sector. The macroeconomic context mentions positive market trends due to rate cuts and the election of Donald Trump, which could positively influence Apple's stock price irrespective of the Q3 earnings report.  Given the mixed Q3 results and the broader positive market sentiment, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the impact of this specific news is relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns over the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, to U.S. tech giants, including Apple. The article suggests that DeepSeek's cheaper and competitive AI model could challenge the dominance of U.S. hyperscalers in AI, potentially impacting future earnings growth for companies like Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings have been a key driver of the bull market, any threat to its earnings growth could negatively affect its stock price. Additionally, the broader market reaction on Monday, with a significant drop in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, indicates investor concern over tech earnings. This suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the near term due to these concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's stock price movement is uncertain due to mixed factors. The company's expected revenue growth of 3.73% year over year, and an estimated 8.26% increase in earnings per share, are positive indicators. However, iPhone sales are likely to fall due to stiff competition in China, and a delay in Apple Intelligence launch has been a concern. Additionally, the stock has a stretched valuation, indicated by a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and a high forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 28.97X. Despite these factors, Apple's AI push and growth in Services segment are expected to drive prospects. Considering these factors, we estimate a slightly positive movement in the stock price due to steady growth in Services and Mac sales, but potential risks due to competition in China and valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. However, the Services segment missed revenue expectations. Despite this mixed quarter, the stock is up 2% since the results. Considering the overall positive trend in the consumer electronics sector and Apple's strong brand loyalty and pricing power, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. However, the uncertainty surrounding future rate cuts and trade policy changes may impact the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple, as it reports that the iPhone was the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, which could boost investor sentiment. However, there are concerns about the overall market share decline and a significant drop in device sales compared to the previous year. The mixed signals from the market share data and the commentary from analysts about Apple's valuation being high may temper enthusiasm. While the recent price action shows a slight recovery, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the competitive landscape in China and the potential for further declines in market share. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of price rise and a notable probability of price fall due to the negative sales trend and valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On the positive side, Apple expects revenue growth, earnings are projected to increase, and the Services segment is expected to continue its double-digit growth. Mac sales are also expected to rise. Apple's AI push with Apple Intelligence is a long-term positive. However, iPhone sales are expected to decline due to competition in China, and the company faces a stretched valuation. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates negative sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight shift towards a more negative outlook. The negative aspects seem to outweigh the positives in the short term, but the AI push and Services growth provide some support. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the Q3 earnings of several consumer electronics companies, with Apple mentioned as having a mixed quarter. While Apple exceeded revenue expectations slightly and saw operating income surpass predictions, its Services segment underperformed.  The stock is reported to be up 2% since the earnings announcement, suggesting a positive market reaction despite the mixed results.  However, the article's primary focus is not on Apple, but rather a broader overview of the consumer electronics sector. The macroeconomic context, including rate cuts and the election of Donald Trump, introduces significant uncertainty and potential for broader market influences on Apple's stock price.  Considering the mixed Q3 results, the positive market reaction, and the significant macroeconomic uncertainties, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the impact of this specific news is relatively low.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement.  My prediction leans towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the positive market reaction, but acknowledges the significant external factors that could easily shift the balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a competitive threat from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, which has sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, particularly affecting tech giants like Apple. The concern is that DeepSeek's cheaper and more efficient AI model could challenge the dominance of U.S. hyperscalers in AI, potentially impacting future earnings growth for companies like Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings have been a key driver of the bull market, any threat to its earnings growth could negatively affect its stock price. The broader market reaction, with significant drops in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, indicates investor concern over tech earnings. This suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the near term due to these concerns. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified product portfolio may provide some resilience, but the immediate impact of the news is likely negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings report, expectations of low to mid-single digit revenue growth, and specific segment performances. iPhone sales are expected to decline due to competition in China, while Services and Mac sales are anticipated to grow. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and a stretched valuation. Considering these mixed factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to growth in Services and Mac sales, but risks remain due to competition and valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple.

However, the uncertainty surrounding future rate cuts and trade policy changes may impact the stock price. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price fall due to concerns over competition, valuation, and earnings growth, while others predict a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to steady growth in Services and Mac sales.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple is less exposed to the competitive threat from DeepSeek's AI model compared to its peers. Analysts at Baird suggest that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without significant investment in large language models or infrastructure, potentially catalyzing better cycles of product upgrades. These points are supportive of Apple's stock price. However, there is still caution due to the overall market sentiment around AI and the mixed historical performance of Apple\u2019s stock, particularly in terms of iPhone sales in China.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
