(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Where the UK\u2019s ISA millionaires are investing\nNews Content: The number of investors with \u00a31 million or more in their stocks and shares individual savings account (ISA) is on the rise, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's (HL.L) platform data, which revealed where they are putting their money.\n\nThe UK's biggest investment platform said there were 1,322 \"ISA millionaires\" on its platform as of the end of December.\n\nThe figure was up 14% over the previous six months alone and was much higher when compared to the 168 ISA millionaires on the platform seven years ago, with just three recorded in 2012.\n\nHL found that the average age of an ISA millionaire on its platform was now 72 years old, down from 74 six months ago. However, the gender split of ISA millionaires had not changed from two years ago, with just over two-thirds found to be men.\n\n\"Some people get into investment in the hope of getting rich quick, but the vast majority of ISA millionaires have built a fortune through the far more reliable approach of getting rich slow,\" said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at HL.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\n\"They don\u2019t necessarily take enormous risks: many consistently invest as much as possible of their annual allowance, in a diverse and balanced portfolio, every year, for decades.\"\n\nMarshall pointed out that the top 10 stocks bought by this group were dominated by UK-listed blue-chip companies, including those that have traditionally paid strong dividends.\n\n\"It means most of them aren\u2019t speculating,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not in a hurry to trade them regularly either as, while most ISA millionaires traded in 2024, this has tended to be infrequent.\"\n\nAs for the most bought funds, Marshall said ISA millionaires were investing in a broad international mix of popular funds. Half of these funds were focused on a diversified mix of global companies, though there were also a couple of UK funds on the list, including an income fund.\n\n\"This reflects that as investors get older, some of the portfolio may have been reconfigured for income,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a larger portfolio, you have more scope to add specialist funds into the mix, which is why we see a technology and India fund in the list of popular investments. Investors with a larger portfolio may be willing to take more risks, partly as they may have more scope for loss, or have sufficient stores of value elsewhere, such as cash ISAs, savings accounts, or annuities.\"\n\nHere's more detail on which were the most popular stocks and funds with HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLegal & General Group (LGEN.L)\n\nFinancial services company Legal & General Group was one name on the list, despite its shares trading nearly 8% in the red on a one-year basis.\n\nIn December, the firm said it was planning to return capital to investors and was on track to meet financial targets. L&G said it was on track to deliver mid-single digital growth in operating profit for the 2024 fiscal year, in line with guidance\n\nOperating profit in its half-year results came in at \u00a3920m ($1.14bn), slightly below the \u00a3924m it delivered in the first half of 2023. Profit after tax attributable to shareholders was down 41% to \u00a3223m.\n\nHowever, L&G raised its half-year dividend by 5% to 6p per share. The company's full-year results are due out on 12 March.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(LGEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nAnother big name on the list was BP, though shares in the oil major are down nearly 10% on a one-year basis.\n\nIn October, BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The oil major reported a nearly 30% slump in underlying replacement cost profit to $2.3bn (\u00a31.85bn) in the third quarter. Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric BP uses as its version of net income.\n\nBP attributed the fall in net income in the third quarter to factors such as weaker realised refining margins and a poor oil trading result.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite worse quarterly results, BP announced a share buyback of $1.75bn as part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that is still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\n\nOil prices have been under pressure over concerns about weaker demand and geopolitical tensions, which has pushed brent crude (BZ=F) back below $78 per barrel.\n\nBP's fourth quarter results and its latest dividend announcement are due out on 11 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(BP.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMiner Rio Tinto also made HL's list of the most-bought stocks by ISA millionaires. While the stock is down nearly 12% over the past year, it recently ticked up slightly on reports that it had been in talks with Glencore (GLEN.L) about a potential merger, though discussions were said to no longer be active.\n\nIn its recently released fourth quarter production results, Rio Tinto said its mined copper production was up 13% in 2024 on the previous year.\n\nCEO Jakob Stausholm said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that US president Donald Trump will give the green light to the company's copper mine in Arizona.\n\n\"I do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he said. It comes after a long battle over permits for the mine.\n\nThe Resolution mine would be the biggest copper mine in North America once completed, capable of producing as much as 25% of US copper demand each year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(RIO.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nISA millionaire top funds\n\nFive Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) index funds were among those most bought by HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nThis included the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P000023MW.L), which tracks the performance of the FTSE World \u2013 Technology index.\n\nThe \u00a33.8bn fund is up nearly 38% over the past year, with its top holdings including iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAnother popular fund with ISA millionaires was Jupiter India (0P0000U20R.L), which has delivered a return of 24% over one year. This return was ahead of its target benchmark of the 13% return from the MSCI India index with net dividends re-invested.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nThe biggest sectors the fund is allocated to are financials and healthcare. Its biggest holdings include tobacco manufacturer Godfrey Phillips India (GODFRYPHLP.NS) and private hospital network Fortis Healthcare (FORTIS.NS).\n\nArtemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L), which invests in UK companies, was also named on HL's list. The fund has produced a return of 15% over one year, beating the FTSE All-Share's (0P00000CNT.L) 9.5%.\n\nFinancials also make up the biggest share of sector exposure in this fund, followed by consumer discretionary and staples firms.\n\nTop holdings include Pearson (PSON.L), which provides educational materials and technology, along with private equity investment trust 3i Group (III.L).\n\nRead more:\n\n6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency Five ways to save on the cost of having children\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in a popular technology fund, which suggests strong investor confidence in the company. The overall trend of ISA millionaires indicates a preference for stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading, which could positively influence AAPL's stock price. However, external factors such as market volatility and economic conditions could still impact the stock negatively. Given the positive sentiment around technology investments and AAPL's inclusion in a well-performing fund, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article provides a mixed view of Apple's Q3 performance. While revenue exceeded expectations and operating income was encouraging, the Services segment missed revenue targets. The stock is already up 2% since the results were released, suggesting some positive sentiment is already priced in. The overall market update mentions rate cuts and a surge after Trump's election, but also highlights uncertainty for 2025. Given the mixed results and existing price increase, further significant upside is less likely in the short term. The market uncertainty also adds a degree of risk. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a significant rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success raises concerns about the overall AI spending outlook and negatively impacted Nvidia and other tech giants, Apple's situation is nuanced.  The article highlights DeepSeek's app becoming the top download on the Apple App Store. This suggests a potential positive indirect impact on Apple's services revenue. However, the broader market sell-off and uncertainty surrounding future AI spending could still negatively affect Apple's stock price, especially given its upcoming earnings report.  The overall market reaction is uncertain, with some analysts calling Monday's sell-off an overreaction.  Considering the mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more likely in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator for the stock. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an above-average valuation, which could deter some investors due to potential overvaluation concerns. The balance between strong financial performance and high valuation leads to a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Given Apple's consistent performance and brand strength, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the high valuation introduces some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors are considering buying Apple stock before January 30, implying potential positive expectations. However, the news content mentions that Apple trades at an above-average valuation, which could be a negative factor. Despite this, the fact that Apple is described as 'still printing money' indicates strong financial performance. The mixed signals suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, but the above-average valuation might temper significant gains. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities reflect a degree of uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of DeepSeek's cheaper and competitive AI model on the stock market, particularly on US tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. The article suggests that this development could hurt future AI chip sales and bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI. As a result, the earnings estimates of Big Tech companies, including Apple, may be revised downward. However, the article also notes that this could lead to a broader market rally, with more stocks outperforming the index. Considering Apple's position as a leader in the tech industry, its stock price may be affected by the potential decline in earnings estimates, but the company's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty may mitigate the impact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not contain specific information related to Apple Inc. It appears to be a general query or title, likely referring to an article or report detailing Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Without additional context or details about Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple, it is impossible to determine how this news would affect Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
