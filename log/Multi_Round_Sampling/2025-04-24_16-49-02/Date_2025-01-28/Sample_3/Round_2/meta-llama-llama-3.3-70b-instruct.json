(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why DeepSeek has been so unsettling for the stock market in 3 charts\nNews Content: A cheaper, competitive AI model from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) on Monday as it challenged one of the key drivers of the current bull market.\n\nFor the first time in a while, investors had a tangible reason to believe some US tech giants, namely Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), might not grow earnings by as much as initially hoped in the coming year. The team behind DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence model maker, claimed that the technology uses cheaper chips and less data. Investors are concerned this could hurt future AI chip sales for a company like Nvidia as well as bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI.\n\nThe problem for markets is that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years.\n\n\"The key pillar of this bull market is earning estimates moving higher,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \"Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year.\"\n\nAs Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, Big Tech earnings from the giants \u2014 Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 have seen earnings estimates rise more than the rest of the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe (IEUR) index over the past 12 months.\n\nYesterday's more than 3% decline in the Nasdaq and 1.5% drop in the S&P 500 show how the market could react if both the blue (Big Tech earnings estimates) and green lines (the rest of S&P 500 estimates) in Krishna's chart below begin reversing direction.\n\nThe expected scrutiny over tech earnings will come amid a market that Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told Yahoo Finance is ripe for change. Bernstein'scontribution to Yahoo Finance's Chartbook showed how just 29% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024 and 30% outperformed in 2023. This marked the lowest number of outperformers since the late 1990s.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably incorrect that there is a new paradigm in which the 'Magnificent Seven' secularly dominate the market,\" Bernstein said. \"Such extreme, narrow leadership is rare because it goes against capitalism, open markets, and competition.\"\n\n\"We think 2025 [will] be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBernstein's call for broader returns in 2025 matches the takeaway from a chart shared with Yahoo Finance by Nicole Inui, HSBC's head of equity research for the Americas. Inui's chart shows that while Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow more than the other 493 stocks in the index in 2025, the gap is expected to narrow, making the case for a broadening of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Mag 7, while still outpacing the overall index on earnings growth, is expected to be less of an outlier.\"\n\nTo both Bernstein and Inui's credit, that market action played out on Monday. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Nvidia's large losses led to most of the downside action in the overall index.\n\nThis introduces a stark reality for investors. Should Big Tech's dominance wane, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500. But it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Jan. 15, 2025, in New York City.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in a popular technology fund, which suggests strong investor confidence in the company. The overall trend of ISA millionaires indicates a preference for stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading, which could positively influence AAPL's stock price. However, external factors such as market volatility and economic conditions could still impact the stock negatively. Given the positive sentiment around technology investments and AAPL's inclusion in a well-performing fund, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article provides a mixed view of Apple's Q3 performance. While revenue exceeded expectations and operating income was encouraging, the Services segment missed revenue targets. The stock is already up 2% since the results were released, suggesting some positive sentiment is already priced in. The overall market update mentions rate cuts and a surge after Trump's election, but also highlights uncertainty for 2025. Given the mixed results and existing price increase, further significant upside is less likely in the short term. The market uncertainty also adds a degree of risk. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a significant rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success raises concerns about the overall AI spending outlook and negatively impacted Nvidia and other tech giants, Apple's situation is nuanced.  The article highlights DeepSeek's app becoming the top download on the Apple App Store. This suggests a potential positive indirect impact on Apple's services revenue. However, the broader market sell-off and uncertainty surrounding future AI spending could still negatively affect Apple's stock price, especially given its upcoming earnings report.  The overall market reaction is uncertain, with some analysts calling Monday's sell-off an overreaction.  Considering the mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more likely in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still generating significant revenue ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator for the stock. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an above-average valuation, which could deter some investors due to potential overvaluation concerns. The balance between strong financial performance and high valuation leads to a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Given Apple's consistent performance and brand strength, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the high valuation introduces some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors are considering buying Apple stock before January 30, implying potential positive expectations. However, the news content mentions that Apple trades at an above-average valuation, which could be a negative factor. Despite this, the fact that Apple is described as 'still printing money' indicates strong financial performance. The mixed signals suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, but the above-average valuation might temper significant gains. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities reflect a degree of uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of DeepSeek's cheaper and competitive AI model on the stock market, particularly on US tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. The article suggests that this development could hurt future AI chip sales and bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI. As a result, the earnings estimates of Big Tech companies, including Apple, may be revised downward. However, the article also notes that this could lead to a broader market rally, with more stocks outperforming the index. Considering Apple's position as a leader in the tech industry, its stock price may be affected by the potential decline in earnings estimates, but the company's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty may mitigate the impact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not contain specific information related to Apple Inc. It appears to be a general query or title, likely referring to an article or report detailing Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Without additional context or details about Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple, it is impossible to determine how this news would affect Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies, with Apple Inc. being a top holding in a popular technology fund. This suggests strong investor confidence in Apple, particularly as ISA millionaires tend to favor stable, long-term investments. However, there are mixed signals from previous predictions, with some indicating concerns about market volatility and economic conditions. Overall, the positive sentiment around technology investments and AAPL's inclusion in a well-performing fund leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising, despite some caution due to external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article provides a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple. While it highlights that the Services segment missed revenue expectations, overall revenue exceeded expectations and operating income was encouraging. The stock is already up 2% since the results, indicating some positive market reaction. The comparison to other consumer electronics companies like Sonos, GoPro, and Peloton provides context, showing that Apple's performance is relatively stable. The market update mentions both positive factors (rate cuts, post-election surge) and uncertainties (future rate cuts, trade policy). Considering the existing positive momentum and Apple's overall strong position, I believe the probability of a further rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the uncertainties prevent a very high probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The DeepSeek AI model's success creates uncertainty regarding future AI spending, impacting Nvidia and other tech giants. This sell-off could negatively affect Apple, especially given its upcoming earnings report. However, DeepSeek's app topping the Apple App Store suggests a potential positive indirect impact on Apple's services revenue.  The overall market reaction is uncertain, with some analysts viewing Monday's sell-off as an overreaction.  While the broader market downturn and concerns about AI spending weigh heavily, Apple's strong brand, diversified product portfolio, and the potential positive impact from DeepSeek's app success on its App Store mitigate the negative impact to some extent.  Considering the mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more likely in the short term.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall due to the prevailing negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty surrounding AI spending, but the potential for a positive impact from the App Store success prevents a significantly negative prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is still performing well financially ('printing money'), which is a positive indicator. However, it also notes that the stock trades at an above-average valuation, which could deter some investors due to perceived overvaluation. The mixed signals\u2014strong financial performance versus high valuation\u2014suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook. Given Apple's strong brand and consistent performance, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the high valuation introduces some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of DeepSeek's cheaper and competitive AI model on the stock market, particularly on US tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. While this development could hurt future AI chip sales and bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI, it may also lead to a broader market rally with more stocks outperforming the index. Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty may mitigate the negative impact. However, the article suggests that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher, and any challenge to this trend could negatively affect Apple's stock price. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for a broader market rally, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not contain specific information related to Apple Inc. It appears to be a general query or title, likely referring to an article or report detailing Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Without additional context or details about Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple, it is impossible to determine how this news would directly affect Apple's stock price. The previous models' predictions show a mix of sentiments, ranging from slightly positive to significantly negative. Since the news itself does not provide direct information about Apple's performance or market standing, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement will depend on factors unrelated to this particular headline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
