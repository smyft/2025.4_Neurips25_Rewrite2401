      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\nNews Content: Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model than its other Big Tech rivals who have invested heavily in building out their AI capabilities, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts argued that the iPhone maker, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on [large language models] or infrastructure\".\n\nAlthough the company is continuing to roll out its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service in its latest iPhone offerings, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is \"limited\", the analysts said. Indeed, longer term, expanding generative AI capabilities could catalyze a \"better cycle\" of product upgrades, they noted.\n\nDeepSeek, a small Chinese start-up, roiled global stock markets on Monday after it introduced a free chatbot it says can compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant, which is run on the model, became the top-rated app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said the company represented a \"wake-up call\" for America's tech giants.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\nApple is due to report its December quarter results after the closing bell on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\n\nNextEra Energy's XPLR Infrastructure shares tank on dividend suspension\n\nS&P, Nasdaq eye higher open as AI stocks recover, earnings roll in\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in a popular technology fund, which suggests strong investor confidence in the company. The overall sentiment from ISA millionaires indicates a preference for stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading. Given Apple's position in a well-performing fund and the general positive outlook for technology stocks, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. However, external factors such as market volatility and economic conditions could still lead to a potential decline, but these seem less likely based on the current news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. Baird's analysis suggests Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI without massive capital expenditure, mitigating concerns about DeepSeek's emergence. The article highlights Apple's strategic advantage in leveraging generative AI for product upgrades. While DeepSeek's app topping the App Store is a point of concern, the overall sentiment is that Apple's approach to AI is sustainable and efficient. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty, but the Baird's analysis provides a positive outlook. Given the positive sentiment and strategic positioning, a slight upward movement is more likely than a fall. However, the market's reaction to the earnings report will be a significant factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: BofA's positive outlook on Apple, citing its defensive nature, growth potential amidst market volatility, and specific catalysts like the upcoming iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and iPhone 17 release, significantly increases the probability of a price rise.  Apple's 3% rise on a day of significant market downturn further strengthens this positive outlook. The mention of edge AI benefits from DeepSeek's advancements also adds to the bullish sentiment.  While there's always inherent market risk, the confluence of positive factors presented by BofA makes a price increase more likely than a decrease in the short to medium term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) financial news suggests mixed signals. On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth, with a 14% year-over-year increase, and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the overall sentiment is bearish, as indicated by the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflecting analyst concerns. The stagnant top-line growth, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence add to the negative outlook. The key metrics to watch\u2014China results, Services growth, and iPhone sales\u2014will likely dictate the stock's movement post-earnings. Given the mixed signals but leaning towards bearish sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK's ISA millionaires, who tend to invest in a diverse and balanced portfolio of blue-chip companies, including those that pay strong dividends. The article mentions that Apple (AAPL) is one of the top holdings in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has seen a significant return of nearly 38% over the past year. This suggests that Apple's stock is likely to be positively affected by the investment trends of ISA millionaires. However, the article does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, which could impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated based on the indirect positive sentiment and the overall trend of investment in technology stocks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported revenues of $94.93 billion, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite the mixed performance in the Services segment, the operating income surpassed expectations, leading to a 2% increase in stock price post-earnings. The overall market context, including rate cuts and a thriving stock market in 2024, suggests positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being a top holding in a popular technology fund. This suggests strong investor confidence in Apple, as ISA millionaires tend to favor stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading. The overall sentiment from the news is positive, indicating a preference for reliable investments, which bodes well for AAPL's stock price. Additionally, previous predictions from various models show a general bullish sentiment towards Apple, with probabilities leaning towards a price rise. However, external market factors and upcoming earnings reports could introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news suggests Apple is strategically positioned to benefit from AI advancements without incurring massive capital expenditures, unlike its competitors.

The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the Baird's analysis provides a positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight decrease in the bullish sentiment compared to earlier rounds, possibly due to the DeepSeek news and the upcoming earnings report. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards for a rise and upwards for a fall, while still maintaining a slightly positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive for Apple.  BofA's recommendation, coupled with Apple's 3% gain on a down market day, strongly suggests a bullish outlook.  The analysts cite several catalysts for future growth, including new product launches, improved margins, and the potential for edge AI benefits from DeepSeek's technology. While there's always inherent market risk, the weight of positive factors significantly outweighs any negative implications from the broader market sell-off. The previous predictions also largely lean towards a price increase, although there is some variation in the degree of confidence. Considering the specific positive factors mentioned in the BofA report and Apple's performance on the day of the news, a higher probability of a price rise is justified.  The previous predictions provide a range of probabilities, but the consensus is positive, supporting a higher probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

(AAPL) as a key player in the AI and technology sector, referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio'. Cramer's bullish stance on AI and Apple's strategic positioning in the market, particularly with its upcoming products and services, contribute to a positive sentiment. However, recent iPhone shipment declines in China and analyst downgrades have impacted the stock. Despite these mixed signals, Cramer's overall confidence in Apple's role in the AI ecosystem and its historical performance suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling. The mention of Apple's potential in AI and its defensive nature, along with growth catalysts like new iPhone releases and modem insourcing, supports a bullish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the investment habits of UK's ISA millionaires, who tend to invest in a diverse and balanced portfolio of blue-chip companies, including those that pay strong dividends.

Previous predictions from various models generally lean towards a positive outlook, with probabilities ranging between 0.6 and 0.75 for a stock price rise. However, the mixed signals from different sources and some bearish sentiments suggest a balanced view. Considering the current earnings results and market context, the probability of a stock price rise appears slightly higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies, with Apple Inc.
