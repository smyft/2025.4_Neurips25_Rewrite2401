(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\nNews Content: This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) : Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in a popular technology fund, which suggests strong investor confidence in the company. The overall sentiment from ISA millionaires indicates a preference for stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading. Given Apple's position in a well-performing fund and the general positive outlook for technology stocks, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. However, external factors such as market volatility and economic conditions could still lead to a potential decline, but these seem less likely based on the current news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. Baird's analysis suggests Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI without massive capital expenditure, mitigating concerns about DeepSeek's emergence. The article highlights Apple's strategic advantage in leveraging generative AI for product upgrades. While DeepSeek's app topping the App Store is a point of concern, the overall sentiment is that Apple's approach to AI is sustainable and efficient. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty, but the Baird's analysis provides a positive outlook. Given the positive sentiment and strategic positioning, a slight upward movement is more likely than a fall. However, the market's reaction to the earnings report will be a significant factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: BofA's positive outlook on Apple, citing its defensive nature, growth potential amidst market volatility, and specific catalysts like the upcoming iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and iPhone 17 release, significantly increases the probability of a price rise.  Apple's 3% rise on a day of significant market downturn further strengthens this positive outlook. The mention of edge AI benefits from DeepSeek's advancements also adds to the bullish sentiment.  While there's always inherent market risk, the confluence of positive factors presented by BofA makes a price increase more likely than a decrease in the short to medium term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) financial news suggests mixed signals. On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth, with a 14% year-over-year increase, and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the overall sentiment is bearish, as indicated by the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflecting analyst concerns. The stagnant top-line growth, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence add to the negative outlook. The key metrics to watch\u2014China results, Services growth, and iPhone sales\u2014will likely dictate the stock's movement post-earnings. Given the mixed signals but leaning towards bearish sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK's ISA millionaires, who tend to invest in a diverse and balanced portfolio of blue-chip companies, including those that pay strong dividends. The article mentions that Apple (AAPL) is one of the top holdings in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has seen a significant return of nearly 38% over the past year. This suggests that Apple's stock is likely to be positively affected by the investment trends of ISA millionaires. However, the article does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, which could impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated based on the indirect positive sentiment and the overall trend of investment in technology stocks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported revenues of $94.93 billion, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite the mixed performance in the Services segment, the operating income surpassed expectations, leading to a 2% increase in stock price post-earnings. The overall market context, including rate cuts and a thriving stock market in 2024, suggests positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being a top holding in a popular technology fund. This suggests strong investor confidence in Apple, as ISA millionaires tend to favor stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading. The overall sentiment from the news is positive, indicating a preference for reliable investments, which bodes well for AAPL's stock price. Additionally, previous predictions from various models show a general bullish sentiment towards Apple, with probabilities leaning towards a price rise. However, external market factors and upcoming earnings reports could introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news suggests Apple is strategically positioned to benefit from AI advancements without incurring massive capital expenditures, unlike its competitors. Baird's analysis highlights Apple's advantage as a consumer-facing product manufacturer, potentially leading to a better product upgrade cycle. While DeepSeek's emergence and its app's success on the App Store raise concerns, the overall sentiment is that Apple's approach to AI is sustainable and efficient. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the Baird's analysis provides a positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight decrease in the bullish sentiment compared to earlier rounds, possibly due to the DeepSeek news and the upcoming earnings report. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards for a rise and upwards for a fall, while still maintaining a slightly positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive for Apple.  BofA's recommendation, coupled with Apple's 3% gain on a down market day, strongly suggests a bullish outlook.  The analysts cite several catalysts for future growth, including new product launches, improved margins, and the potential for edge AI benefits from DeepSeek's technology. While there's always inherent market risk, the weight of positive factors significantly outweighs any negative implications from the broader market sell-off. The previous predictions also largely lean towards a price increase, although there is some variation in the degree of confidence. Considering the specific positive factors mentioned in the BofA report and Apple's performance on the day of the news, a higher probability of a price rise is justified.  The previous predictions provide a range of probabilities, but the consensus is positive, supporting a higher probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth (14% year-over-year), and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the overall sentiment is bearish, as indicated by the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflecting analyst concerns. The stagnant top-line growth, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence add to the negative outlook. The key metrics to watch\u2014China results, Services growth, and iPhone sales\u2014will likely dictate the stock's movement post-earnings. Given the mixed signals but leaning towards bearish sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a key player in the AI and technology sector, referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio'. Cramer's bullish stance on AI and Apple's strategic positioning in the market, particularly with its upcoming products and services, contribute to a positive sentiment. However, recent iPhone shipment declines in China and analyst downgrades have impacted the stock. Despite these mixed signals, Cramer's overall confidence in Apple's role in the AI ecosystem and its historical performance suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling. The mention of Apple's potential in AI and its defensive nature, along with growth catalysts like new iPhone releases and modem insourcing, supports a bullish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the investment habits of UK's ISA millionaires, who tend to invest in a diverse and balanced portfolio of blue-chip companies, including those that pay strong dividends. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has seen a significant return of nearly 38% over the past year.

The overall market context, including rate cuts and a thriving stock market in 2024, suggests positive sentiment. Previous predictions from various models generally lean towards a positive outlook, with probabilities ranging between 0.6 and 0.75 for a stock price rise. However, the mixed signals from different sources and some bearish sentiments suggest a balanced view. Considering the current earnings results and market context, the probability of a stock price rise appears slightly higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
