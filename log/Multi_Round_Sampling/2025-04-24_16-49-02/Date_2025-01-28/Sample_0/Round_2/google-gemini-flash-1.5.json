(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\nNews Content: Investing.com -- The stock market suffered a sharp sell-off Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.46% and the Nasdaq falling 3% after Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough sparked concerns over lower AI-related spending.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America believe that the pullback created idiosyncratic buy opportunities in certain stocks. They highlighted Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), noting that \u201ceach name has compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/datacenter spending.\u201d\n\nBofA also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), citing their defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility.\n\nApple is one of the rare technology stocks that rose higher on Monday.\n\n\u201cOn a day when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, Apple shares were up 3% as investors realize the potential for edge AI and there is a flight to safety driven by Apple\u2019s earnings resiliency,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan noted.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is truly able to lower the cost of AI inferencing and better models are developed faster and cheaper, then edge AI applications and Apple as the edge device maker, stands to benefit. We view Apple as the ultimate play on having an LLM in your pocket,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA analysts believe several key drivers could drive upside in the tech giant\u2019s shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE in March or April, insourcing of modem production to improve gross margins, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025.\n\nFor IBM, BofA highlighted catalysts including a new mainframe cycle, acceleration in its Software (ETR:SOWGn) division, and mergers and acquisitions activity. Analysts project higher growth in Software for the next three years, driven by Enterprise AI opportunities and the launch of a new Mainframe (z17) in 2025.\n\n\u201cFor IBM, AI represents an opportunity in its Consulting business as it seeks to position itself as the go-to partner of choice for AI consulting.\n\nCorning's stock fell by 8.7% on Monday, but BofA analysts point out multiple key drivers that could foster recovery and growth. These include the cyclical recovery in its Optical business, the Lumen/Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program ramps, opportunities in the Solar sector, consistent profitability in the Display segment, and its upcoming Investor Day on March 18.\n\nFor HPE, which saw its shares sink 5.8%, the firm points to the Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) acquisition and cost reduction initiatives as factors that could improve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAI server exposure is not embedded in the valuation multiple,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan added.\n\nBofA also sees a significant value unlock for Western Digital with its anticipated spin-off, estimating value creation between $5-10 billion. The firm also references the SanDisk Analyst Day (February 11) and Western Digital Analyst Day (February 12) as key catalysts. The company\u2019s stock lost 4.5% Monday.\n\nSeagate also saw a pullback, but BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing improvements in the HDD industry structure since the last downturn.\n\nThe company's focus on ramping up Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology, increasing gross margins through a higher mix of high-capacity/HAMR drives, and continued data center spending (excluding AI) are seen as primary growth drivers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\n\nMorgan Stanley cuts Nvidia stock target after DeepSeek release\n\nUS stock futures edge higher; Fed meeting, tech sector in focus\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in a popular technology fund, which suggests strong investor confidence in the company. The overall sentiment from ISA millionaires indicates a preference for stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading. Given Apple's position in a well-performing fund and the general positive outlook for technology stocks, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. However, external factors such as market volatility and economic conditions could still lead to a potential decline, but these seem less likely based on the current news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. Baird's analysis suggests Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI without massive capital expenditure, mitigating concerns about DeepSeek's emergence. The article highlights Apple's strategic advantage in leveraging generative AI for product upgrades. While DeepSeek's app topping the App Store is a point of concern, the overall sentiment is that Apple's approach to AI is sustainable and efficient. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty, but the Baird's analysis provides a positive outlook. Given the positive sentiment and strategic positioning, a slight upward movement is more likely than a fall. However, the market's reaction to the earnings report will be a significant factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: BofA's positive outlook on Apple, citing its defensive nature, growth potential amidst market volatility, and specific catalysts like the upcoming iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and iPhone 17 release, significantly increases the probability of a price rise.  Apple's 3% rise on a day of significant market downturn further strengthens this positive outlook. The mention of edge AI benefits from DeepSeek's advancements also adds to the bullish sentiment.  While there's always inherent market risk, the confluence of positive factors presented by BofA makes a price increase more likely than a decrease in the short to medium term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) financial news suggests mixed signals. On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth, with a 14% year-over-year increase, and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the overall sentiment is bearish, as indicated by the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflecting analyst concerns. The stagnant top-line growth, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence add to the negative outlook. The key metrics to watch\u2014China results, Services growth, and iPhone sales\u2014will likely dictate the stock's movement post-earnings. Given the mixed signals but leaning towards bearish sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of UK's ISA millionaires, who tend to invest in a diverse and balanced portfolio of blue-chip companies, including those that pay strong dividends. The article mentions that Apple (AAPL) is one of the top holdings in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has seen a significant return of nearly 38% over the past year. This suggests that Apple's stock is likely to be positively affected by the investment trends of ISA millionaires. However, the article does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, which could impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated based on the indirect positive sentiment and the overall trend of investment in technology stocks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported revenues of $94.93 billion, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite the mixed performance in the Services segment, the operating income surpassed expectations, leading to a 2% increase in stock price post-earnings. The overall market context, including rate cuts and a thriving stock market in 2024, suggests positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend of ISA millionaires investing in a diverse range of stocks, including technology and blue-chip companies, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being a top holding in a popular technology fund. This suggests strong investor confidence in Apple, as ISA millionaires tend to favor stable, long-term investments rather than speculative trading. The overall sentiment from the news is positive, indicating a preference for reliable investments, which bodes well for AAPL's stock price. Additionally, previous predictions from various models show a general bullish sentiment towards Apple, with probabilities leaning towards a price rise. However, external market factors and upcoming earnings reports could introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news suggests Apple is strategically positioned to benefit from AI advancements without incurring massive capital expenditures, unlike its competitors. Baird's analysis highlights Apple's advantage as a consumer-facing product manufacturer, potentially leading to a better product upgrade cycle. While DeepSeek's emergence and its app's success on the App Store raise concerns, the overall sentiment is that Apple's approach to AI is sustainable and efficient. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the Baird's analysis provides a positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight decrease in the bullish sentiment compared to earlier rounds, possibly due to the DeepSeek news and the upcoming earnings report. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards for a rise and upwards for a fall, while still maintaining a slightly positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive for Apple.  BofA's recommendation, coupled with Apple's 3% gain on a down market day, strongly suggests a bullish outlook.  The analysts cite several catalysts for future growth, including new product launches, improved margins, and the potential for edge AI benefits from DeepSeek's technology. While there's always inherent market risk, the weight of positive factors significantly outweighs any negative implications from the broader market sell-off. The previous predictions also largely lean towards a price increase, although there is some variation in the degree of confidence. Considering the specific positive factors mentioned in the BofA report and Apple's performance on the day of the news, a higher probability of a price rise is justified.  The previous predictions provide a range of probabilities, but the consensus is positive, supporting a higher probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth (14% year-over-year), and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.

(AAPL) as a key player in the AI and technology sector, referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio'. Cramer's bullish stance on AI and Apple's strategic positioning in the market, particularly with its upcoming products and services, contribute to a positive sentiment. However, recent iPhone shipment declines in China and analyst downgrades have impacted the stock. Despite these mixed signals, Cramer's overall confidence in Apple's role in the AI ecosystem and its historical performance suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling. The mention of Apple's potential in AI and its defensive nature, along with growth catalysts like new iPhone releases and modem insourcing, supports a bullish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the investment habits of UK's ISA millionaires, who tend to invest in a diverse and balanced portfolio of blue-chip companies, including those that pay strong dividends.

However, the mixed signals from different sources and some bearish sentiments suggest a balanced view. Considering the current earnings results and market context, the probability of a stock price rise appears slightly higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
