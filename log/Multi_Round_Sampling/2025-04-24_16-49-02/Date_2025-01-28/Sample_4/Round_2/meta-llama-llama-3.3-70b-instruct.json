(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model, which could impact the earnings growth of major tech companies, including Apple. The overall sentiment in the market is cautious, with a significant sell-off in tech stocks, particularly affecting the Nasdaq. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings estimates are closely tied to the performance of other tech giants, the probability of its stock price falling is higher. The market's reaction indicates a shift in investor sentiment, leading to increased scrutiny over tech earnings, which could negatively impact Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are generally positive, highlighting Apple's historical success in creating wealth for investors. However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't contain any specific information about Apple's current performance or future prospects. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as positive association, but the lack of concrete details limits the impact. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. A slight positive bias is assigned due to the positive sentiment, but the probabilities are close to neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's investment in AI infrastructure and partnerships with major players like Google Cloud and NVIDIA. While this is positive for the overall AI sector, the direct impact on Apple is minimal.  The article mentions Apple's stock price rose 3.2% on the day, but this is likely due to broader market factors or other company-specific news not detailed here. The news about Verizon's AI initiatives is not directly relevant to Apple's core business or its AI strategy. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this specific news is considered low, with the likelihood of a price change in either direction being roughly equal.  The provided data shows Apple already had a positive day, unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase, anticipated revenue growth, and strong prospects in AI innovation. The 4% rally in shares indicates immediate positive market reaction. The focus on AI advancements and the expected growth in the Services segment further bolster confidence in the company's future performance. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the overall tone of the news is optimistic, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's views on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and AI PCs, highlighting his concerns about the lack of consumer interest in AI-enabled products and his personal use of ChatGPT. Cramer's comments suggest that while he sees potential in AI, he is skeptical about the immediate impact on Apple's stock due to lukewarm consumer response to AI PCs and concerns about the company's iPhone sales in China. He also mentions that investors focus too much on the iPhone and not enough on enterprise AI use cases. The article does not provide a clear bullish or bearish signal but indicates a cautious approach towards AI-related stocks, including AAPL. Given Cramer's discussion on AI's potential but current lack of impact on consumer demand and his focus on enterprise AI use cases, the news may have a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on AAPL stock price as it fails to provide a strong bullish case for AI-related products.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the technology sector's potential for 20% earnings growth in 2025, according to a portfolio manager. Despite initial losses due to the introduction of a new AI model, the manager remains optimistic about the sector's growth prospects. This optimism, combined with the historical trend of new product entries creating increased demand, suggests a positive outlook for the sector. However, the article also mentions uncertainty regarding the impact of DeepSeek's new AI model and valuation concerns. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the uncertainties mentioned.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook on Apple Inc., highlighted by the analyst's bullish stance, increased price target, and potential growth in AI-driven innovations. The forecasted revenue growth in the Services segment and the potential for AI advancements to drive mobile upgrades further support optimistic expectations. While there are warnings and regulatory risks mentioned, the overall sentiment from the analyst and the market reaction suggest a positive trajectory.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model, which could negatively impact the earnings growth of major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment is cautious, as evidenced by the recent sell-off in tech stocks, particularly affecting the Nasdaq. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings estimates are closely tied to the performance of other tech giants, the probability of its stock price falling is higher. While some analysts maintain a positive outlook on Apple's long-term prospects, the immediate reaction to the news suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, associating Apple with wealth creation alongside Nvidia and AMD. However, it's backward-looking and lacks specific details about Apple's current situation. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, reflecting uncertainty. Round 0 had predictions ranging from 0.25 to 0.8 for the stock price rising. Considering the general positive sentiment but the lack of concrete, forward-looking information, I'll lean slightly positive, but not as strongly as some previous predictions. The fact that the news is about past performance tempers the potential impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Verizon's AI infrastructure investments and partnerships, which have minimal direct impact on Apple.  Apple's stock price already rose 3.2% on the day the article was published, suggesting the movement was driven by other factors. The news about Verizon is positive for the broader AI sector but doesn't provide specific information relevant to Apple's business or future prospects.  While some previous models predicted a higher probability of a price rise based on other, unspecified news, this article itself offers no significant bullish or bearish signals for Apple. Considering the lack of direct relevance and the already positive market movement, the probability of a price change due to this news is low.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement in the short term, independent of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a predominantly positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a 4% rally in shares following a bullish analyst rating and increased price target to $250. The anticipation of revenue growth in the December quarter and the March 2025 quarter, along with the potential for AI-driven innovations to spur device upgrades, further supports a positive sentiment. The Services segment's expected 12% year-over-year revenue increase also highlights Apple's ability to diversify its revenue streams. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the overall tone of the news is optimistic, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising in the near term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a positive outlook, with most assigning higher probabilities to a stock price rise. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is assessed to be higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's views on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and AI PCs, highlighting his concerns about the lack of consumer interest in AI-enabled products and his personal use of ChatGPT. Cramer expresses skepticism about the immediate impact on Apple's stock due to lukewarm consumer response to AI PCs and concerns about the company's iPhone sales in China. However, he also acknowledges the potential of AI in enterprise use cases. Given Cramer's cautious approach towards AI-related stocks and the lack of a strong bullish case for AI-related products, the news may have a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on AAPL stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for the technology sector, with a portfolio manager predicting 20% earnings growth in 2025. Despite initial losses due to the introduction of a new AI model, the manager remains optimistic about the sector's growth prospects. This optimism, combined with the historical trend of new product entries creating increased demand, suggests a positive outlook for the sector. However, the article also mentions uncertainty regarding the impact of DeepSeek's new AI model and valuation concerns. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. Additionally, analyzing the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend towards a more positive outlook, with some models assigning a high probability of the stock price rising. Taking into account the overall sentiment and the trend in previous predictions, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.7, while the probability of the stock price falling is 0.3.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as a bullish analyst rating, increased price target, anticipated revenue growth, and strong AI innovation prospects. The immediate 4% rally in shares indicates a strong positive market reaction. While there are cautionary notes about regulatory risks and competitive threats, the overall tone of the news is optimistic, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Previous predictions from various models were mixed, but many indicated a positive outlook.
