(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model, which could impact the earnings growth of major tech companies, including Apple. The overall sentiment in the market is cautious, with a significant sell-off in tech stocks, particularly affecting the Nasdaq. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings estimates are closely tied to the performance of other tech giants, the probability of its stock price falling is higher. The market's reaction indicates a shift in investor sentiment, leading to increased scrutiny over tech earnings, which could negatively impact Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are generally positive, highlighting Apple's historical success in creating wealth for investors. However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't contain any specific information about Apple's current performance or future prospects. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as positive association, but the lack of concrete details limits the impact. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. A slight positive bias is assigned due to the positive sentiment, but the probabilities are close to neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's investment in AI infrastructure and partnerships with major players like Google Cloud and NVIDIA. While this is positive for the overall AI sector, the direct impact on Apple is minimal.  The article mentions Apple's stock price rose 3.2% on the day, but this is likely due to broader market factors or other company-specific news not detailed here. The news about Verizon's AI initiatives is not directly relevant to Apple's core business or its AI strategy. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this specific news is considered low, with the likelihood of a price change in either direction being roughly equal.  The provided data shows Apple already had a positive day, unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase, anticipated revenue growth, and strong prospects in AI innovation. The 4% rally in shares indicates immediate positive market reaction. The focus on AI advancements and the expected growth in the Services segment further bolster confidence in the company's future performance. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the overall tone of the news is optimistic, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's views on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and AI PCs, highlighting his concerns about the lack of consumer interest in AI-enabled products and his personal use of ChatGPT. Cramer's comments suggest that while he sees potential in AI, he is skeptical about the immediate impact on Apple's stock due to lukewarm consumer response to AI PCs and concerns about the company's iPhone sales in China. He also mentions that investors focus too much on the iPhone and not enough on enterprise AI use cases. The article does not provide a clear bullish or bearish signal but indicates a cautious approach towards AI-related stocks, including AAPL. Given Cramer's discussion on AI's potential but current lack of impact on consumer demand and his focus on enterprise AI use cases, the news may have a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on AAPL stock price as it fails to provide a strong bullish case for AI-related products.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the technology sector's potential for 20% earnings growth in 2025, according to a portfolio manager. Despite initial losses due to the introduction of a new AI model, the manager remains optimistic about the sector's growth prospects. This optimism, combined with the historical trend of new product entries creating increased demand, suggests a positive outlook for the sector. However, the article also mentions uncertainty regarding the impact of DeepSeek's new AI model and valuation concerns. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the uncertainties mentioned.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook on Apple Inc., highlighted by the analyst's bullish stance, increased price target, and potential growth in AI-driven innovations. The forecasted revenue growth in the Services segment and the potential for AI advancements to drive mobile upgrades further support optimistic expectations. While there are warnings and regulatory risks mentioned, the overall sentiment from the analyst and the market reaction suggest a positive trajectory.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model, which could negatively impact the earnings growth of major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment is cautious, as evidenced by the recent sell-off in tech stocks, particularly affecting the Nasdaq. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings estimates are closely tied to the performance of other tech giants, the probability of its stock price falling is higher. While some analysts maintain a positive outlook on Apple's long-term prospects, the immediate reaction to the news suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, associating Apple with wealth creation alongside Nvidia and AMD. However, it's backward-looking and lacks specific details about Apple's current situation. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, reflecting uncertainty. Round 0 had predictions ranging from 0.25 to 0.8 for the stock price rising. Considering the general positive sentiment but the lack of concrete, forward-looking information, I'll lean slightly positive, but not as strongly as some previous predictions. The fact that the news is about past performance tempers the potential impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Verizon's AI infrastructure investments and partnerships, which have minimal direct impact on Apple.  Apple's stock price already rose 3.2% on the day the article was published, suggesting the movement was driven by other factors. The news about Verizon is positive for the broader AI sector but doesn't provide specific information relevant to Apple's business or future prospects.  While some previous models predicted a higher probability of a price rise based on other, unspecified news, this article itself offers no significant bullish or bearish signals for Apple. Considering the lack of direct relevance and the already positive market movement, the probability of a price change due to this news is low.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement in the short term, independent of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a predominantly positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a 4% rally in shares following a bullish analyst rating and increased price target to $250. The anticipation of revenue growth in the December quarter and the March 2025 quarter, along with the potential for AI-driven innovations to spur device upgrades, further supports a positive sentiment. The Services segment's expected 12% year-over-year revenue increase also highlights Apple's ability to diversify its revenue streams. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the overall tone of the news is optimistic, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising in the near term. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a positive outlook, with most assigning higher probabilities to a stock price rise. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is assessed to be higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's views on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and AI PCs, highlighting his concerns about the lack of consumer interest in AI-enabled products and his personal use of ChatGPT. Cramer expresses skepticism about the immediate impact on Apple's stock due to lukewarm consumer response to AI PCs and concerns about the company's iPhone sales in China. However, he also acknowledges the potential of AI in enterprise use cases. Given Cramer's cautious approach towards AI-related stocks and the lack of a strong bullish case for AI-related products, the news may have a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on AAPL stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for the technology sector, with a portfolio manager predicting 20% earnings growth in 2025. Despite initial losses due to the introduction of a new AI model, the manager remains optimistic about the sector's growth prospects. This optimism, combined with the historical trend of new product entries creating increased demand, suggests a positive outlook for the sector. However, the article also mentions uncertainty regarding the impact of DeepSeek's new AI model and valuation concerns. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. Additionally, analyzing the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend towards a more positive outlook, with some models assigning a high probability of the stock price rising. Taking into account the overall sentiment and the trend in previous predictions, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.7, while the probability of the stock price falling is 0.3.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as a bullish analyst rating, increased price target, anticipated revenue growth, and strong AI innovation prospects. The immediate 4% rally in shares indicates a strong positive market reaction. While there are cautionary notes about regulatory risks and competitive threats, the overall tone of the news is optimistic, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Previous predictions from various models were mixed, but many indicated a positive outlook. The combination of these factors leads to a higher probability of stock price rising.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model, which could negatively impact the earnings growth of major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment is cautious, as evidenced by the recent sell-off in tech stocks, particularly affecting the Nasdaq. While some analysts maintain a positive outlook on Apple's long-term prospects, the immediate reaction to the news suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term. Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds, with a tendency towards caution, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, associating Apple with wealth creation alongside Nvidia and AMD. However, it's backward-looking and lacks specific details about Apple's current situation. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, reflecting uncertainty. Considering the general positive sentiment but the lack of concrete, forward-looking information, I'll lean slightly positive, but not as strongly as some previous predictions. The fact that the news is about past performance tempers the potential impact. The trend of the previous predictions seems to be stabilizing around a slightly positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Verizon's AI infrastructure investments and partnerships, which have minimal direct impact on Apple.

While some models lean towards a positive outlook based on other information, this article itself offers no significant bullish or bearish signals for Apple.  Therefore, I assign a near-neutral probability to both price increase and decrease, slightly favoring a neutral stance given the lack of direct relevance and the already positive market movement observed before this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a predominantly positive outlook for Apple Inc.
