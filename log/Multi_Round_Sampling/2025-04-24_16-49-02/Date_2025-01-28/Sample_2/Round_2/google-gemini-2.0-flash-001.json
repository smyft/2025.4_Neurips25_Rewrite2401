(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\nNews Content: Investing.com -- The stock market suffered a sharp sell-off Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.46% and the Nasdaq falling 3% after Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough sparked concerns over lower AI-related spending.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America believe that the pullback created idiosyncratic buy opportunities in certain stocks. They highlighted Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), noting that \u201ceach name has compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/datacenter spending.\u201d\n\nBofA also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), citing their defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility.\n\nApple is one of the rare technology stocks that rose higher on Monday.\n\n\u201cOn a day when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, Apple shares were up 3% as investors realize the potential for edge AI and there is a flight to safety driven by Apple\u2019s earnings resiliency,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan noted.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is truly able to lower the cost of AI inferencing and better models are developed faster and cheaper, then edge AI applications and Apple as the edge device maker, stands to benefit. We view Apple as the ultimate play on having an LLM in your pocket,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA analysts believe several key drivers could drive upside in the tech giant\u2019s shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE in March or April, insourcing of modem production to improve gross margins, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025.\n\nFor IBM, BofA highlighted catalysts including a new mainframe cycle, acceleration in its Software (ETR:SOWGn) division, and mergers and acquisitions activity. Analysts project higher growth in Software for the next three years, driven by Enterprise AI opportunities and the launch of a new Mainframe (z17) in 2025.\n\n\u201cFor IBM, AI represents an opportunity in its Consulting business as it seeks to position itself as the go-to partner of choice for AI consulting.\n\nCorning's stock fell by 8.7% on Monday, but BofA analysts point out multiple key drivers that could foster recovery and growth. These include the cyclical recovery in its Optical business, the Lumen/Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program ramps, opportunities in the Solar sector, consistent profitability in the Display segment, and its upcoming Investor Day on March 18.\n\nFor HPE, which saw its shares sink 5.8%, the firm points to the Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) acquisition and cost reduction initiatives as factors that could improve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAI server exposure is not embedded in the valuation multiple,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan added.\n\nBofA also sees a significant value unlock for Western Digital with its anticipated spin-off, estimating value creation between $5-10 billion. The firm also references the SanDisk Analyst Day (February 11) and Western Digital Analyst Day (February 12) as key catalysts. The company\u2019s stock lost 4.5% Monday.\n\nSeagate also saw a pullback, but BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing improvements in the HDD industry structure since the last downturn.\n\nThe company's focus on ramping up Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology, increasing gross margins through a higher mix of high-capacity/HAMR drives, and continued data center spending (excluding AI) are seen as primary growth drivers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\n\nMorgan Stanley cuts Nvidia stock target after DeepSeek release\n\nUS stock futures edge higher; Fed meeting, tech sector in focus\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend among ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a popular fund that has performed well suggests positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires investing for long-term growth rather than speculation indicates a stable investment environment. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts for a significant price movement in Apple's stock, leading to a balanced outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively close.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the initial market sell-off was triggered by concerns about AI spending, Bank of America (BofA) sees this as a buying opportunity, specifically highlighting Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth. The fact that Apple's stock rose 3% on a day when AI stocks were down significantly suggests investor confidence in Apple's resilience and potential in edge AI. BofA analysts point to several upcoming catalysts, including the iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and the iPhone 17 release. These factors, combined with the 'flight to safety' sentiment towards Apple, suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, general market volatility and unforeseen negative news could still cause a price decline, so the probability of a fall is not negligible.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov and the impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. While OpenAI's government partnership is positive, the main focus is on DeepSeek's disruptive potential.  The article highlights that Apple gained ground during the market sell-off caused by DeepSeek's success, suggesting that Apple's existing platforms could benefit from cheaper AI models. This implies that Apple might see increased efficiency and potentially lower costs in developing its own AI initiatives.  However, the overall impact is uncertain, as DeepSeek's long-term success and the true cost of its model remain unclear. The news is more likely to be viewed as a positive catalyst for Apple due to the potential for cost savings and increased competitiveness in the AI space, rather than a direct negative impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov, which strengthens its partnership with the US government and positions its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership. This development could be seen as positive for the tech sector, including Apple, as it suggests continued innovation and investment in AI. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's rise, on the belief that its platforms would benefit from more cost-effective AI models. This indicates a potential positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the broader industry dynamics and Apple's positioning in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. Analysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The top line revisions have been slightly more negative, but stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The article highlights key metrics to watch, including China results, Services results, and iPhone results. Given the mixed expectations and the current bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the launch of ChatGPT Gov by OpenAI, aimed at streamlining government access to AI models, which positions OpenAI as a key player in AI technology. The news also mentions the potential benefits of more cost-effective AI models and innovation. While the market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout has caused some panic, the broader perspective suggests that increased competition could drive further innovation and growth. Apple Inc., although not directly involved in the mentioned AI initiatives, may indirectly benefit from a push towards more cost-effective AI solutions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend among ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a popular fund that has performed well suggests positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires investing for long-term growth rather than speculation indicates a stable investment environment. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts for a significant price movement in Apple's stock, leading to a balanced outlook. Considering previous predictions, there is a general positive sentiment towards Apple, but market volatility and external factors could still impact the stock negatively. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is overall positive for Apple. BofA sees a buying opportunity due to the DeepSeek selloff, highlighting Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth. The fact that Apple's stock rose 3% while other AI stocks fell significantly is a strong indicator of investor confidence. BofA analysts also point to several upcoming catalysts, including the iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and the iPhone 17 release. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a positive outlook, with most models assigning a higher probability to the stock price rising. Considering all these factors, I believe the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  While the OpenAI/government partnership and the Stargate Project suggest continued investment in AI, the main focus is the disruptive potential of DeepSeek.  The article highlights that Apple benefited from the DeepSeek-induced sell-off, suggesting a potential for cost savings and increased competitiveness due to cheaper AI models. This is a positive factor. However, the long-term impact of DeepSeek remains uncertain, and the news doesn't directly impact Apple's core business.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 probability of a price rise. Considering the indirect positive impact from cheaper AI and the overall market uncertainty, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but it remains close to even odds.  The uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's long-term impact and the lack of direct Apple-specific news contribute to a relatively neutral outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov, which strengthens its partnership with the US government and positions its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership. This development could be seen as positive for the tech sector, including Apple, as it suggests continued innovation and investment in AI. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's rise, on the belief that its platforms would benefit from more cost-effective AI models. This indicates a potential positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the broader industry dynamics and Apple's positioning in the AI space. However, the initial market panic caused by DeepSeek's breakout and the uncertainty around its true costs and capabilities introduce some risk. Considering the mixed signals and the overall positive sentiment towards Apple's resilience and potential benefits from cost-effective AI models, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's positive views on Apple Inc., referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio'. Cramer emphasizes Apple's steady performance and potential for growth, comparing it to a reliable player in a portfolio. The article also mentions Apple's position in the AI space and the potential benefits from the growing demand for AI technologies. However, it notes that since Cramer's comments in September, the stock has only seen a negligible 0.18% increase, with some fluctuations due to analyst downgrades and reports on iPhone shipments in China. Despite this, the overall sentiment from Cramer and the company's positioning in AI suggest a positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. Analysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The top line revisions have been slightly more negative, but stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The article highlights key metrics to watch, including China results, Services results, and iPhone results. Given the mixed expectations and the current bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, considering the potential for positive surprises in the earnings report, such as improved China sales or strong Services results, the probability of a rise is not negligible. Comparing with previous predictions, the trend seems to be towards a more cautious outlook, with some models predicting a higher probability of a fall. Taking into account the overall analysis and the trend in previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.42 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech industry, including OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov and the disruptive potential of DeepSeek's AI model. OpenAI's government partnership with ChatGPT Gov can positively influence the tech sector by promoting AI innovation and investment. However, the rise of DeepSeek, which claims to offer cost-effective AI solutions, could cause concern among investors regarding traditional tech giants' competitive advantage. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off period indicates investor confidence in the company's resilience, potentially benefiting from these broader industry dynamics. Overall, the news seems to have a mixed but mildly positive impact on Apple\u2019s stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
