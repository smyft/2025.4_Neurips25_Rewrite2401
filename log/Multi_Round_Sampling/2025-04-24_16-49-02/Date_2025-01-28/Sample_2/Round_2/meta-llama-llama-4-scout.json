(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend among ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a popular fund that has performed well suggests positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires investing for long-term growth rather than speculation indicates a stable investment environment. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts for a significant price movement in Apple's stock, leading to a balanced outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively close.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the initial market sell-off was triggered by concerns about AI spending, Bank of America (BofA) sees this as a buying opportunity, specifically highlighting Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth. The fact that Apple's stock rose 3% on a day when AI stocks were down significantly suggests investor confidence in Apple's resilience and potential in edge AI. BofA analysts point to several upcoming catalysts, including the iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and the iPhone 17 release. These factors, combined with the 'flight to safety' sentiment towards Apple, suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, general market volatility and unforeseen negative news could still cause a price decline, so the probability of a fall is not negligible.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov and the impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. While OpenAI's government partnership is positive, the main focus is on DeepSeek's disruptive potential.  The article highlights that Apple gained ground during the market sell-off caused by DeepSeek's success, suggesting that Apple's existing platforms could benefit from cheaper AI models. This implies that Apple might see increased efficiency and potentially lower costs in developing its own AI initiatives.  However, the overall impact is uncertain, as DeepSeek's long-term success and the true cost of its model remain unclear. The news is more likely to be viewed as a positive catalyst for Apple due to the potential for cost savings and increased competitiveness in the AI space, rather than a direct negative impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov, which strengthens its partnership with the US government and positions its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership. This development could be seen as positive for the tech sector, including Apple, as it suggests continued innovation and investment in AI. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's rise, on the belief that its platforms would benefit from more cost-effective AI models. This indicates a potential positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the broader industry dynamics and Apple's positioning in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. Analysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The top line revisions have been slightly more negative, but stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The article highlights key metrics to watch, including China results, Services results, and iPhone results. Given the mixed expectations and the current bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the launch of ChatGPT Gov by OpenAI, aimed at streamlining government access to AI models, which positions OpenAI as a key player in AI technology. The news also mentions the potential benefits of more cost-effective AI models and innovation. While the market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout has caused some panic, the broader perspective suggests that increased competition could drive further innovation and growth. Apple Inc., although not directly involved in the mentioned AI initiatives, may indirectly benefit from a push towards more cost-effective AI solutions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend among ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a popular fund that has performed well suggests positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires investing for long-term growth rather than speculation indicates a stable investment environment. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts for a significant price movement in Apple's stock, leading to a balanced outlook. Considering previous predictions, there is a general positive sentiment towards Apple, but market volatility and external factors could still impact the stock negatively. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is overall positive for Apple. BofA sees a buying opportunity due to the DeepSeek selloff, highlighting Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth. The fact that Apple's stock rose 3% while other AI stocks fell significantly is a strong indicator of investor confidence. BofA analysts also point to several upcoming catalysts, including the iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and the iPhone 17 release. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a positive outlook, with most models assigning a higher probability to the stock price rising. Considering all these factors, I believe the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  While the OpenAI/government partnership and the Stargate Project suggest continued investment in AI, the main focus is the disruptive potential of DeepSeek.  The article highlights that Apple benefited from the DeepSeek-induced sell-off, suggesting a potential for cost savings and increased competitiveness due to cheaper AI models. This is a positive factor. However, the long-term impact of DeepSeek remains uncertain, and the news doesn't directly impact Apple's core business.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 probability of a price rise. Considering the indirect positive impact from cheaper AI and the overall market uncertainty, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but it remains close to even odds.  The uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's long-term impact and the lack of direct Apple-specific news contribute to a relatively neutral outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov, which strengthens its partnership with the US government and positions its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership. This development could be seen as positive for the tech sector, including Apple, as it suggests continued innovation and investment in AI. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's rise, on the belief that its platforms would benefit from more cost-effective AI models. This indicates a potential positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the broader industry dynamics and Apple's positioning in the AI space. However, the initial market panic caused by DeepSeek's breakout and the uncertainty around its true costs and capabilities introduce some risk. Considering the mixed signals and the overall positive sentiment towards Apple's resilience and potential benefits from cost-effective AI models, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's positive views on Apple Inc., referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio'. Cramer emphasizes Apple's steady performance and potential for growth, comparing it to a reliable player in a portfolio. The article also mentions Apple's position in the AI space and the potential benefits from the growing demand for AI technologies. However, it notes that since Cramer's comments in September, the stock has only seen a negligible 0.18% increase, with some fluctuations due to analyst downgrades and reports on iPhone shipments in China. Despite this, the overall sentiment from Cramer and the company's positioning in AI suggest a positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price.

The article highlights key metrics to watch, including China results, Services results, and iPhone results. Given the mixed expectations and the current bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, considering the potential for positive surprises in the earnings report, such as improved China sales or strong Services results, the probability of a rise is not negligible. Comparing with previous predictions, the trend seems to be towards a more cautious outlook, with some models predicting a higher probability of a fall. Taking into account the overall analysis and the trend in previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.42 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech industry, including OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov and the disruptive potential of DeepSeek's AI model. OpenAI's government partnership with ChatGPT Gov can positively influence the tech sector by promoting AI innovation and investment. However, the rise of DeepSeek, which claims to offer cost-effective AI solutions, could cause concern among investors regarding traditional tech giants' competitive advantage. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off period indicates investor confidence in the company's resilience, potentially benefiting from these broader industry dynamics. Overall, the news seems to have a mixed but mildly positive impact on Apple\u2019s stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
