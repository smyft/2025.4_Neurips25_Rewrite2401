(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Where the UK\u2019s ISA millionaires are investing\nNews Content: The number of investors with \u00a31 million or more in their stocks and shares individual savings account (ISA) is on the rise, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's (HL.L) platform data, which revealed where they are putting their money.\n\nThe UK's biggest investment platform said there were 1,322 \"ISA millionaires\" on its platform as of the end of December.\n\nThe figure was up 14% over the previous six months alone and was much higher when compared to the 168 ISA millionaires on the platform seven years ago, with just three recorded in 2012.\n\nHL found that the average age of an ISA millionaire on its platform was now 72 years old, down from 74 six months ago. However, the gender split of ISA millionaires had not changed from two years ago, with just over two-thirds found to be men.\n\n\"Some people get into investment in the hope of getting rich quick, but the vast majority of ISA millionaires have built a fortune through the far more reliable approach of getting rich slow,\" said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at HL.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\n\"They don\u2019t necessarily take enormous risks: many consistently invest as much as possible of their annual allowance, in a diverse and balanced portfolio, every year, for decades.\"\n\nMarshall pointed out that the top 10 stocks bought by this group were dominated by UK-listed blue-chip companies, including those that have traditionally paid strong dividends.\n\n\"It means most of them aren\u2019t speculating,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not in a hurry to trade them regularly either as, while most ISA millionaires traded in 2024, this has tended to be infrequent.\"\n\nAs for the most bought funds, Marshall said ISA millionaires were investing in a broad international mix of popular funds. Half of these funds were focused on a diversified mix of global companies, though there were also a couple of UK funds on the list, including an income fund.\n\n\"This reflects that as investors get older, some of the portfolio may have been reconfigured for income,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a larger portfolio, you have more scope to add specialist funds into the mix, which is why we see a technology and India fund in the list of popular investments. Investors with a larger portfolio may be willing to take more risks, partly as they may have more scope for loss, or have sufficient stores of value elsewhere, such as cash ISAs, savings accounts, or annuities.\"\n\nHere's more detail on which were the most popular stocks and funds with HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLegal & General Group (LGEN.L)\n\nFinancial services company Legal & General Group was one name on the list, despite its shares trading nearly 8% in the red on a one-year basis.\n\nIn December, the firm said it was planning to return capital to investors and was on track to meet financial targets. L&G said it was on track to deliver mid-single digital growth in operating profit for the 2024 fiscal year, in line with guidance\n\nOperating profit in its half-year results came in at \u00a3920m ($1.14bn), slightly below the \u00a3924m it delivered in the first half of 2023. Profit after tax attributable to shareholders was down 41% to \u00a3223m.\n\nHowever, L&G raised its half-year dividend by 5% to 6p per share. The company's full-year results are due out on 12 March.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(LGEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nAnother big name on the list was BP, though shares in the oil major are down nearly 10% on a one-year basis.\n\nIn October, BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The oil major reported a nearly 30% slump in underlying replacement cost profit to $2.3bn (\u00a31.85bn) in the third quarter. Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric BP uses as its version of net income.\n\nBP attributed the fall in net income in the third quarter to factors such as weaker realised refining margins and a poor oil trading result.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite worse quarterly results, BP announced a share buyback of $1.75bn as part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that is still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\n\nOil prices have been under pressure over concerns about weaker demand and geopolitical tensions, which has pushed brent crude (BZ=F) back below $78 per barrel.\n\nBP's fourth quarter results and its latest dividend announcement are due out on 11 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(BP.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMiner Rio Tinto also made HL's list of the most-bought stocks by ISA millionaires. While the stock is down nearly 12% over the past year, it recently ticked up slightly on reports that it had been in talks with Glencore (GLEN.L) about a potential merger, though discussions were said to no longer be active.\n\nIn its recently released fourth quarter production results, Rio Tinto said its mined copper production was up 13% in 2024 on the previous year.\n\nCEO Jakob Stausholm said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that US president Donald Trump will give the green light to the company's copper mine in Arizona.\n\n\"I do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he said. It comes after a long battle over permits for the mine.\n\nThe Resolution mine would be the biggest copper mine in North America once completed, capable of producing as much as 25% of US copper demand each year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(RIO.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nISA millionaire top funds\n\nFive Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) index funds were among those most bought by HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nThis included the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P000023MW.L), which tracks the performance of the FTSE World \u2013 Technology index.\n\nThe \u00a33.8bn fund is up nearly 38% over the past year, with its top holdings including iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAnother popular fund with ISA millionaires was Jupiter India (0P0000U20R.L), which has delivered a return of 24% over one year. This return was ahead of its target benchmark of the 13% return from the MSCI India index with net dividends re-invested.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nThe biggest sectors the fund is allocated to are financials and healthcare. Its biggest holdings include tobacco manufacturer Godfrey Phillips India (GODFRYPHLP.NS) and private hospital network Fortis Healthcare (FORTIS.NS).\n\nArtemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L), which invests in UK companies, was also named on HL's list. The fund has produced a return of 15% over one year, beating the FTSE All-Share's (0P00000CNT.L) 9.5%.\n\nFinancials also make up the biggest share of sector exposure in this fund, followed by consumer discretionary and staples firms.\n\nTop holdings include Pearson (PSON.L), which provides educational materials and technology, along with private equity investment trust 3i Group (III.L).\n\nRead more:\n\n6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency Five ways to save on the cost of having children\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend among ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a popular fund that has performed well suggests positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires investing for long-term growth rather than speculation indicates a stable investment environment. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts for a significant price movement in Apple's stock, leading to a balanced outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively close.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the initial market sell-off was triggered by concerns about AI spending, Bank of America (BofA) sees this as a buying opportunity, specifically highlighting Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth. The fact that Apple's stock rose 3% on a day when AI stocks were down significantly suggests investor confidence in Apple's resilience and potential in edge AI. BofA analysts point to several upcoming catalysts, including the iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and the iPhone 17 release. These factors, combined with the 'flight to safety' sentiment towards Apple, suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, general market volatility and unforeseen negative news could still cause a price decline, so the probability of a fall is not negligible.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov and the impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. While OpenAI's government partnership is positive, the main focus is on DeepSeek's disruptive potential.  The article highlights that Apple gained ground during the market sell-off caused by DeepSeek's success, suggesting that Apple's existing platforms could benefit from cheaper AI models. This implies that Apple might see increased efficiency and potentially lower costs in developing its own AI initiatives.  However, the overall impact is uncertain, as DeepSeek's long-term success and the true cost of its model remain unclear. The news is more likely to be viewed as a positive catalyst for Apple due to the potential for cost savings and increased competitiveness in the AI space, rather than a direct negative impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov, which strengthens its partnership with the US government and positions its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership. This development could be seen as positive for the tech sector, including Apple, as it suggests continued innovation and investment in AI. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's rise, on the belief that its platforms would benefit from more cost-effective AI models. This indicates a potential positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the broader industry dynamics and Apple's positioning in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. Analysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The top line revisions have been slightly more negative, but stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The article highlights key metrics to watch, including China results, Services results, and iPhone results. Given the mixed expectations and the current bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the launch of ChatGPT Gov by OpenAI, aimed at streamlining government access to AI models, which positions OpenAI as a key player in AI technology. The news also mentions the potential benefits of more cost-effective AI models and innovation. While the market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout has caused some panic, the broader perspective suggests that increased competition could drive further innovation and growth. Apple Inc., although not directly involved in the mentioned AI initiatives, may indirectly benefit from a push towards more cost-effective AI solutions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend among ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The mention of Apple in the context of a popular fund that has performed well suggests positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the overall trend of ISA millionaires investing for long-term growth rather than speculation indicates a stable investment environment. However, the news does not provide any specific catalysts for a significant price movement in Apple's stock, leading to a balanced outlook. Considering previous predictions, there is a general positive sentiment towards Apple, but market volatility and external factors could still impact the stock negatively. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is overall positive for Apple. BofA sees a buying opportunity due to the DeepSeek selloff, highlighting Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth. The fact that Apple's stock rose 3% while other AI stocks fell significantly is a strong indicator of investor confidence. BofA analysts also point to several upcoming catalysts, including the iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and the iPhone 17 release. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a positive outlook, with most models assigning a higher probability to the stock price rising. Considering all these factors, I believe the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  While the OpenAI/government partnership and the Stargate Project suggest continued investment in AI, the main focus is the disruptive potential of DeepSeek.  The article highlights that Apple benefited from the DeepSeek-induced sell-off, suggesting a potential for cost savings and increased competitiveness due to cheaper AI models. This is a positive factor. However, the long-term impact of DeepSeek remains uncertain, and the news doesn't directly impact Apple's core business.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 probability of a price rise. Considering the indirect positive impact from cheaper AI and the overall market uncertainty, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but it remains close to even odds.  The uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's long-term impact and the lack of direct Apple-specific news contribute to a relatively neutral outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov, which strengthens its partnership with the US government and positions its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership.

This indicates a potential positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the broader industry dynamics and Apple's positioning in the AI space. However, the initial market panic caused by DeepSeek's breakout and the uncertainty around its true costs and capabilities introduce some risk. Considering the mixed signals and the overall positive sentiment towards Apple's resilience and potential benefits from cost-effective AI models, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's positive views on Apple Inc., referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio'. Cramer emphasizes Apple's steady performance and potential for growth, comparing it to a reliable player in a portfolio. The article also mentions Apple's position in the AI space and the potential benefits from the growing demand for AI technologies. However, it notes that since Cramer's comments in September, the stock has only seen a negligible 0.18% increase, with some fluctuations due to analyst downgrades and reports on iPhone shipments in China. Despite this, the overall sentiment from Cramer and the company's positioning in AI suggest a positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price.

Given the mixed expectations and the current bearish sentiment among analysts, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, considering the potential for positive surprises in the earnings report, such as improved China sales or strong Services results, the probability of a rise is not negligible. Comparing with previous predictions, the trend seems to be towards a more cautious outlook, with some models predicting a higher probability of a fall. Taking into account the overall analysis and the trend in previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.42 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech industry, including OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov and the disruptive potential of DeepSeek's AI model. OpenAI's government partnership with ChatGPT Gov can positively influence the tech sector by promoting AI innovation and investment. However, the rise of DeepSeek, which claims to offer cost-effective AI solutions, could cause concern among investors regarding traditional tech giants' competitive advantage. The fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off period indicates investor confidence in the company's resilience, potentially benefiting from these broader industry dynamics. Overall, the news seems to have a mixed but mildly positive impact on Apple\u2019s stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights a growing trend among ISA millionaires investing in blue-chip companies, including technology stocks like Apple. The positive sentiment towards Apple is reinforced by its inclusion in popular funds that have performed well. Additionally, the trend of ISA millionaires investing for long-term growth suggests a stable investment environment. However, there are no specific catalysts mentioned that would lead to significant price movement, leading to a balanced outlook. Considering previous predictions, there is a general positive sentiment towards Apple, but market volatility and external factors could still impact the stock negatively.

Apple's stock rose 3% while other AI stocks declined, indicating investor confidence. BofA highlights upcoming catalysts like the iPhone SE launch, modem insourcing, WWDC, and the iPhone 17 release. Previous predictions also lean towards a positive outlook. However, the overall market volatility and the uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's long-term impact introduce some risk. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  The OpenAI/government partnership and the Stargate Project are positive for the overall AI sector and suggest continued investment, potentially benefiting Apple indirectly.  However, the main focus is the disruptive potential of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup offering cost-effective AI models.  The article highlights that Apple benefited from the DeepSeek-induced sell-off, suggesting a potential for cost savings and increased competitiveness due to cheaper AI models. This is a positive factor for Apple's long-term prospects.  However, the long-term impact of DeepSeek remains uncertain, and the news doesn't directly impact Apple's core business.
