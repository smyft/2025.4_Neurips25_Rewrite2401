(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why AAPL Is Climbing Today\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) is advancing 4% today after a research firm reported that the company's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter. Earlier this month, another research firm stated that AAPL had dropped to third place in terms of smartphone market share in the Asian country.Dan Niles on Apple (AAPL): Data is \u2018Somewhat Disappointing\u2019 and Stock is \u2018Pretty Expensive\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nThe iPhone Was Reportedly the Q4 Market Share Leader in China\n\nThe device's market share in China came in at 17.4% last quarter, the International Data Corporation (IDC) reported. That was slightly above second-place Huawei's 17.2% share. However, the device's market share was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, when it controlled 20% of the market. Further, for all of 2024, its market share dropped to 15.6% from 17.4% in 2023.\n\nLast week, another research firm, Counterpoint, reported that the iPhone's market share had been 17.1% in China last quarter, leaving the device in third place in the huge market. Counterpoint added that the number of devices handed over by Apple in China had tumbled 18.2% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier. In Q4 of 2023, iPhone's market share was 20.2%.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of AAPL Stock\n\nIn the last month, the shares have fallen 4.5%, while they are up 2.5% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a key player in the AI sector, which could attract investor interest. However, the recent performance of AAPL has been mixed, with a significant drop following analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments in China. While Cramer's endorsement may provide some support, the negative sentiment from analysts and the stock's recent decline suggest a higher probability of a price fall. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a price rise due to Cramer's influence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive. A major analyst firm (TD Cowen) reiterated a \"Buy\" rating and significantly increased the price target to $250. This is a strong signal of confidence. The anticipation of a 4% revenue growth in the December quarter and mid-single-digit growth guidance for the March 2025 quarter are also positive indicators. The potential for AI innovation, particularly with Apple's AFM LLM, is a significant growth catalyst. The 12% year-over-year growth in the Services segment further strengthens the bullish case. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the overall sentiment is that Apple is well-positioned for future growth. The GuruFocus warning signs are noted, but the analyst upgrade and AI prospects seem to outweigh those concerns in the short term. Given the positive analyst sentiment, revenue growth expectations, and AI innovation potential, the probability of a stock price rise is significantly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) reports Apple as the top-selling smartphone brand in Q4 with a 17.4% market share, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and an 18.2% year-over-year decline in shipments.  The discrepancy between these reports creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a significant drop in market share compared to the previous year (from 20% to 15.6% for the full year 2024).  The author also expresses skepticism about Apple's future performance relative to AI stocks, suggesting the stock is 'pretty expensive'.  Considering the mixed signals and the author's bearish sentiment, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the initial 4% jump suggests some positive market reaction to the IDC report. However, this initial jump might be short-lived given the conflicting data and overall negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off, attributing the sell-off to concerns over AI-related spending due to DeepSeek's AI breakthrough. BofA analysts see Apple as a defensive stock with potential for growth, especially in edge AI applications, which could benefit from lower AI inferencing costs. They also cite several catalysts for Apple, including the launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, AI-driven use cases at WWDC, and the future release of the iPhone 17. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given BofA's bullish stance and the identified growth drivers, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is high, while the probability of a fall is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. On the positive side, Apple's Services segment is expected to show double-digit growth, and the company's AI push with Apple Intelligence is seen as a competitive advantage. However, concerns include weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a stretched valuation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be 0.45, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be 0.55.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly influence its stock price. The news appears to be about Berkshire Hathaway's ownership, which does not inherently imply a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Without relevant information linking Berkshire Hathaway's ownership to Apple Inc., it's reasonable to assume that this news may not significantly affect Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low and nearly equal, reflecting the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported revenues of $94.93 billion, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite the mixed performance in the Services segment, the operating income surpassed expectations, leading to a 2% increase in stock price post-earnings. The overall market context, including rate cuts and a thriving stock market in 2024, suggests positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
