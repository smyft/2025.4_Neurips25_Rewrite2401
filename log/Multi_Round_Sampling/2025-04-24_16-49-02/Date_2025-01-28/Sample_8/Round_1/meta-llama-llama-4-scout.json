(AAPL)\nNews Headline: The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Dell Technologies, HP and Microsoft\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 28, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBuy, Sell or Hold Apple Stock? Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAppleis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nApple expects the December quarter's (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAAPL's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\n\nLet's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple's iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple's fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion.\n\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple's installed base has been a concern.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL's Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\n\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple's Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple's Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple's estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC's vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo's growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies and HP saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies' 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple's market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\n\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner's list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 27.5%.\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 27.54X.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL's Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nApple's AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul.\n\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \"Magnificent 7\" group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple's stringent privacy standards.\n\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple's near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\n\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a key player in the AI sector, which could attract investor interest. However, the recent performance of AAPL has been mixed, with a significant drop following analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments in China. While Cramer's endorsement may provide some support, the negative sentiment from analysts and the stock's recent decline suggest a higher probability of a price fall. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a price rise due to Cramer's influence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive. A major analyst firm (TD Cowen) reiterated a \"Buy\" rating and significantly increased the price target to $250. This is a strong signal of confidence. The anticipation of a 4% revenue growth in the December quarter and mid-single-digit growth guidance for the March 2025 quarter are also positive indicators. The potential for AI innovation, particularly with Apple's AFM LLM, is a significant growth catalyst. The 12% year-over-year growth in the Services segment further strengthens the bullish case. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the overall sentiment is that Apple is well-positioned for future growth. The GuruFocus warning signs are noted, but the analyst upgrade and AI prospects seem to outweigh those concerns in the short term. Given the positive analyst sentiment, revenue growth expectations, and AI innovation potential, the probability of a stock price rise is significantly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) reports Apple as the top-selling smartphone brand in Q4 with a 17.4% market share, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and an 18.2% year-over-year decline in shipments.  The discrepancy between these reports creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a significant drop in market share compared to the previous year (from 20% to 15.6% for the full year 2024).  The author also expresses skepticism about Apple's future performance relative to AI stocks, suggesting the stock is 'pretty expensive'.  Considering the mixed signals and the author's bearish sentiment, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the initial 4% jump suggests some positive market reaction to the IDC report. However, this initial jump might be short-lived given the conflicting data and overall negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off, attributing the sell-off to concerns over AI-related spending due to DeepSeek's AI breakthrough. BofA analysts see Apple as a defensive stock with potential for growth, especially in edge AI applications, which could benefit from lower AI inferencing costs. They also cite several catalysts for Apple, including the launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, AI-driven use cases at WWDC, and the future release of the iPhone 17. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given BofA's bullish stance and the identified growth drivers, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is high, while the probability of a fall is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. On the positive side, Apple's Services segment is expected to show double-digit growth, and the company's AI push with Apple Intelligence is seen as a competitive advantage. However, concerns include weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a stretched valuation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be 0.45, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be 0.55.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly influence its stock price. The news appears to be about Berkshire Hathaway's ownership, which does not inherently imply a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Without relevant information linking Berkshire Hathaway's ownership to Apple Inc., it's reasonable to assume that this news may not significantly affect Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low and nearly equal, reflecting the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported revenues of $94.93 billion, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite the mixed performance in the Services segment, the operating income surpassed expectations, leading to a 2% increase in stock price post-earnings. The overall market context, including rate cuts and a thriving stock market in 2024, suggests positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
