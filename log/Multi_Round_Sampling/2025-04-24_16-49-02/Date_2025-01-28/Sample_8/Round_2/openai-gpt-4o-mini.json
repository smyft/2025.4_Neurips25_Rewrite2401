(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a key player in the AI sector, which could attract investor interest. However, the recent performance of AAPL has been mixed, with a significant drop following analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments in China. While Cramer's endorsement may provide some support, the negative sentiment from analysts and the stock's recent decline suggest a higher probability of a price fall. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a price rise due to Cramer's influence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive. A major analyst firm (TD Cowen) reiterated a \"Buy\" rating and significantly increased the price target to $250. This is a strong signal of confidence. The anticipation of a 4% revenue growth in the December quarter and mid-single-digit growth guidance for the March 2025 quarter are also positive indicators. The potential for AI innovation, particularly with Apple's AFM LLM, is a significant growth catalyst. The 12% year-over-year growth in the Services segment further strengthens the bullish case. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the overall sentiment is that Apple is well-positioned for future growth. The GuruFocus warning signs are noted, but the analyst upgrade and AI prospects seem to outweigh those concerns in the short term. Given the positive analyst sentiment, revenue growth expectations, and AI innovation potential, the probability of a stock price rise is significantly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) reports Apple as the top-selling smartphone brand in Q4 with a 17.4% market share, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and an 18.2% year-over-year decline in shipments.  The discrepancy between these reports creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a significant drop in market share compared to the previous year (from 20% to 15.6% for the full year 2024).  The author also expresses skepticism about Apple's future performance relative to AI stocks, suggesting the stock is 'pretty expensive'.  Considering the mixed signals and the author's bearish sentiment, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the initial 4% jump suggests some positive market reaction to the IDC report. However, this initial jump might be short-lived given the conflicting data and overall negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off, attributing the sell-off to concerns over AI-related spending due to DeepSeek's AI breakthrough. BofA analysts see Apple as a defensive stock with potential for growth, especially in edge AI applications, which could benefit from lower AI inferencing costs. They also cite several catalysts for Apple, including the launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, AI-driven use cases at WWDC, and the future release of the iPhone 17. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given BofA's bullish stance and the identified growth drivers, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is high, while the probability of a fall is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. On the positive side, Apple's Services segment is expected to show double-digit growth, and the company's AI push with Apple Intelligence is seen as a competitive advantage. However, concerns include weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a stretched valuation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be 0.45, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be 0.55.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly influence its stock price. The news appears to be about Berkshire Hathaway's ownership, which does not inherently imply a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Without relevant information linking Berkshire Hathaway's ownership to Apple Inc., it's reasonable to assume that this news may not significantly affect Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low and nearly equal, reflecting the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported revenues of $94.93 billion, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite the mixed performance in the Services segment, the operating income surpassed expectations, leading to a 2% increase in stock price post-earnings. The overall market context, including rate cuts and a thriving stock market in 2024, suggests positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a key player in the AI sector, which could attract investor interest. However, the recent performance of AAPL has been mixed, with a significant drop following analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments in China. While Cramer's endorsement may provide some support, the negative sentiment from analysts and the stock's recent decline suggest a cautious outlook. The mixed signals from various analysts and the overall bearish sentiment regarding iPhone sales in China contribute to a higher probability of a price fall. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a price rise due to Cramer's influence, but overall, the sentiment leans more towards a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive. TD Cowen's reiterated \"Buy\" rating and increased price target to $250 are strong bullish signals. The expected 4% revenue growth for the December quarter and mid-single-digit growth guidance for March 2025 are also positive. The potential for AI innovation with Apple's AFM LLM is a significant catalyst. The 12% year-over-year growth in the Services segment further supports a positive outlook. While regulatory risks in 2025 are mentioned, the overall sentiment is that Apple is well-positioned for growth. The GuruFocus warning signs are a minor concern, but the analyst upgrade and AI prospects seem to outweigh them in the short term. The stock already jumped 4% on the news. Considering the previous predictions, there is a wide range of opinions. I will adjust my prediction to be slightly more conservative than the most bullish predictions, but still leaning towards a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's market share in China. While IDC reports Apple as the top seller, Counterpoint places it third, highlighting a significant year-over-year decline in shipments. This discrepancy creates uncertainty.  The initial 4% price jump suggests a positive market reaction to the IDC report, but this might be short-lived given the conflicting data and the overall negative sentiment expressed in the article, which mentions the stock being 'pretty expensive' and compares it unfavorably to AI stocks.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.05 to 0.8 probability of a price rise. Considering the conflicting data, the negative sentiment, and the range of previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for a short-term positive impact from the IDC report but also the risk of a subsequent correction due to the conflicting Counterpoint data and overall bearish sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Bank of America's positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) following a market sell-off, attributing the sell-off to concerns over AI-related spending due to DeepSeek's AI breakthrough. BofA analysts see Apple as a defensive stock with potential for growth, especially in edge AI applications, which could benefit from lower AI inferencing costs. They also cite several catalysts for Apple, including the launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, AI-driven use cases at WWDC, and the future release of the iPhone 17. Apple's stock already rose 3% on the day of the sell-off, indicating investor confidence. Given BofA's bullish stance and the identified growth drivers, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is high, while the probability of a fall is low. Previous predictions also show a trend towards a positive outlook, with most models favoring a rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. On the positive side, Apple's Services segment is expected to show double-digit growth, and the company's AI push with Apple Intelligence is seen as a competitive advantage. Additionally, Apple's Mac sales are expected to rise year-over-year. However, concerns include weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a stretched valuation. The company is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on January 30, with expectations of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly lower than the probability of it falling, reflecting a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly influence its stock price. The news appears to be about Berkshire Hathaway's ownership, which does not inherently imply a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance and considering the mixed predictions from other models, which may indicate varying interpretations of indirect influences or external information not provided in the news, a neutral stance is taken. The probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low and nearly equal, reflecting the lack of direct relevance and the mixed market sentiment indicated by other predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Q3 earnings report, highlighting a revenue beat by 0.5%, and an encouraging operating income performance. Despite the mixed performance in the Services segment, the stock price has increased by 2% since the report. Previous predictions show a mix of sentiments, with some models predicting a rise due to bullish analyst ratings and others predicting a fall due to various concerns such as iPhone shipments in China and valuation concerns. The overall market context, including rate cuts and a thriving stock market in 2024, adds a positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
