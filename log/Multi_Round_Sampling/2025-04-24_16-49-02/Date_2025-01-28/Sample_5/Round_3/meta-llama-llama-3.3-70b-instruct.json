(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\nNews Content: This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, which positions OpenAI as a key player in the AI sector, particularly in government applications. While the emergence of DeepSeek has caused initial panic in the market, it is suggested that increased competition could lead to greater innovation and spending in the industry. Apple, along with Meta, is seen as a potential beneficiary of this shift, as their platforms may leverage more cost-effective AI models. Given this context, the overall sentiment appears to favor a rise in Apple's stock price, despite the competitive pressures introduced by DeepSeek.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on investment trends among UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for blue-chip stocks and diversified funds. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which is popular among these investors, the article doesn't directly provide strong positive or negative signals for Apple's stock. The general trend of ISA millionaires investing in technology funds suggests a positive sentiment towards technology stocks, but this is indirect. The article also mentions other stocks and funds, diluting the impact on any single stock like Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Given the indirect nature of the information, a significant price movement is unlikely. The probability of a rise is slightly favored due to the positive sentiment towards technology funds, but the overall impact is limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader tech sector (XLK), not specifically Apple. While a 20% earnings growth projection for Big Tech in 2025 is positive, it's a future prediction and doesn't guarantee immediate stock price movement for Apple.  The mention of 'erosion' in PE ratios and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's impact introduces downside risk.  The news is generally positive for the tech sector, but its impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and uncertain. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral stance, with a slightly higher chance of a rise due to the overall positive sector outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc., including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase, expected revenue growth, and advancements in AI technology that could drive future demand. The Services segment is also showing robust growth, which diversifies revenue streams. These factors collectively suggest a positive outlook for the stock. However, there is mention of potential regulatory risks in 2025, which could pose headwinds. On balance, the positive aspects seem to outweigh the potential negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. However, the article highlights some positive metrics, such as the expected growth in China sales and the robust performance of Apple's Services segment. The iPhone results will also be closely watched, and the adoption rate of Apple Intelligence will be a key factor in determining the stock's movement. Given the mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, due to the overall bearish sentiment among analysts and the company's recent underperformance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple Inc. continues to generate significant profits ('printing money') which is positive for the stock price. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an above-average valuation, which might make it less attractive to some investors. Given the overall positive context of continued profitability, the probability leans slightly towards a stock price rise, but the high valuation could temper this optimism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, which positions OpenAI as a significant player in the AI sector, particularly in government applications. While the emergence of DeepSeek has caused initial panic in the market, it is suggested that increased competition could lead to greater innovation and spending in the industry. Apple, along with Meta, is seen as a potential beneficiary of this shift, as their platforms may leverage more cost-effective AI models. The overall sentiment appears to favor a rise in Apple's stock price, despite the competitive pressures introduced by DeepSeek. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise due to the positive implications of the news for Apple's position in the tech sector.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires, noting their holdings in Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which includes Apple (AAPL) as a top holding. While this indicates a positive sentiment towards technology and Apple, the article's primary focus is on broader investment trends rather than specific catalysts for Apple's stock. The mention of other stocks and funds dilutes the direct impact on Apple. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise due to positive factors like AI advancements and revenue growth, while others are more cautious due to valuation concerns and potential regulatory risks. Given the indirect nature of the news and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'll assign a slightly positive probability for a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for the tech sector, projecting 20% earnings growth in 2025.  However, this is a future projection and doesn't guarantee immediate impact on Apple's stock price.  The mention of PE ratio erosion and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's impact introduces significant downside risk. While the overall sector outlook is positive, the impact on Apple is indirect and uncertain.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. Considering the uncertainty and the future-oriented nature of the positive news, a neutral stance is most appropriate, with a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the positive sector outlook.  The lack of Apple-specific news further supports a neutral prediction.  The previous predictions' range (0.42 to 0.75 for a price rise) also informs this prediction, leaning towards the lower end of that range given the lack of direct Apple-related positive news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting a 4% increase in stock price following a 'Buy' rating reiteration and raised price target by TD Cowan analysts. Positive factors include expected revenue growth, advancements in AI technology (specifically Apple's AFM LLM), and robust growth in the Services segment. These indicators suggest strong future performance and innovation potential. While there are mentions of regulatory risks in 2025, the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Previous predictions also leaned towards a rise, with most models favoring a higher probability of stock price increase. Given the combination of analyst optimism, AI innovation prospects, and strong revenue growth, the probability of the stock price rising is deemed higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics stocks, including Sonos (SONO), GoPro (GPRO), and Peloton, but does not directly provide information about Apple's (AAPL) stock price movement. However, it mentions Apple's Q3 earnings report, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%, and its Services segment showed robust growth. This mixed performance, with the company beating revenue expectations but missing on the Services segment, could lead to a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Given that Apple's stock price has held steady and is up 2% since the results, it suggests that investors are cautiously optimistic. The overall tech sector's positive performance and the company's ability to beat analysts' operating income expectations are encouraging signs. However, the impact of the news on Apple's stock price seems indirect, and with the sector's general trend, there's a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. However, the article highlights some positive metrics, such as the expected growth in China sales and the robust performance of Apple's Services segment. The iPhone results will also be closely watched, and the adoption rate of Apple Intelligence will be a key factor in determining the stock's movement. Considering the mixed signals and the overall bearish sentiment among analysts, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. However, the positive metrics mentioned in the article suggest that the probability of a rise is still significant. Taking into account the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions, I will take a moderate stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s continued profitability as a 'premium smartphone brand' but notes that it trades at an above-average valuation. Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise (e.g., 0.75 from deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall (e.g., 0.58 from meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct). Overall, the news presents a scenario where Apple's strong profitability supports a positive outlook, but the high valuation may deter some investors. The consensus seems to lean slightly towards a positive outlook despite the valuations.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, which positions OpenAI as a significant player in the AI sector, particularly in government applications.

The overall sentiment appears to favor a rise in Apple's stock price, despite the competitive pressures introduced by DeepSeek. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the general trend leans towards a positive outlook for Apple due to its strong profitability and potential benefits from advancements in AI technology.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on the investment preferences of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their holdings in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which includes Apple (AAPL) as a top holding. This suggests a positive sentiment towards technology and Apple. However, the article's primary focus is on broader investment trends rather than specific catalysts for Apple's stock. The mention of other stocks and funds dilutes the direct impact on Apple. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise due to positive factors like AI advancements and revenue growth, while others are more cautious due to valuation concerns and potential regulatory risks. Given the indirect nature of the news and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'll assign a slightly positive probability for a rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The fact that ISA millionaires are investing in funds that hold Apple is a positive signal, but it's not a strong enough signal to warrant a high probability of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news is positive for the broader tech sector, projecting 20% earnings growth in 2025.

However, the overall positive sector outlook and the consistent leaning towards a rise in previous rounds (though not overwhelmingly so) slightly favors a higher probability of a rise.  The previous predictions' range informs this prediction, leaning towards the middle of that range given the lack of direct Apple-related positive news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a bullish outlook for Apple Inc.
