(AAPL)\nNews Headline: OpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov as industry reels from DeepSeek's breakout\nNews Content: OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project.

Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, which positions OpenAI as a key player in the AI sector, particularly in government applications. While the emergence of DeepSeek has caused initial panic in the market, it is suggested that increased competition could lead to greater innovation and spending in the industry. Apple, along with Meta, is seen as a potential beneficiary of this shift, as their platforms may leverage more cost-effective AI models. Given this context, the overall sentiment appears to favor a rise in Apple's stock price, despite the competitive pressures introduced by DeepSeek.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on investment trends among UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for blue-chip stocks and diversified funds. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which is popular among these investors, the article doesn't directly provide strong positive or negative signals for Apple's stock. The general trend of ISA millionaires investing in technology funds suggests a positive sentiment towards technology stocks, but this is indirect. The article also mentions other stocks and funds, diluting the impact on any single stock like Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Given the indirect nature of the information, a significant price movement is unlikely. The probability of a rise is slightly favored due to the positive sentiment towards technology funds, but the overall impact is limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader tech sector (XLK), not specifically Apple. While a 20% earnings growth projection for Big Tech in 2025 is positive, it's a future prediction and doesn't guarantee immediate stock price movement for Apple.  The mention of 'erosion' in PE ratios and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's impact introduces downside risk.  The news is generally positive for the tech sector, but its impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and uncertain. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral stance, with a slightly higher chance of a rise due to the overall positive sector outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc., including a bullish analyst rating and price target increase, expected revenue growth, and advancements in AI technology that could drive future demand. The Services segment is also showing robust growth, which diversifies revenue streams. These factors collectively suggest a positive outlook for the stock. However, there is mention of potential regulatory risks in 2025, which could pose headwinds. On balance, the positive aspects seem to outweigh the potential negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. However, the article highlights some positive metrics, such as the expected growth in China sales and the robust performance of Apple's Services segment. The iPhone results will also be closely watched, and the adoption rate of Apple Intelligence will be a key factor in determining the stock's movement. Given the mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, due to the overall bearish sentiment among analysts and the company's recent underperformance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple Inc. continues to generate significant profits ('printing money') which is positive for the stock price. However, it also mentions that the stock trades at an above-average valuation, which might make it less attractive to some investors. Given the overall positive context of continued profitability, the probability leans slightly towards a stock price rise, but the high valuation could temper this optimism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
