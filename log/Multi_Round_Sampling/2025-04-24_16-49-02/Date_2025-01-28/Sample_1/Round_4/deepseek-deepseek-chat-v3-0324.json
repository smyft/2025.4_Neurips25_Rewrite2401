      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: OpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov as industry reels from DeepSeek's breakout\nNews Content: OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe move further cements OpenAI's partnership with the US government, positioning its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership.\n\nLast week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office. Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential recovery in tech stocks after a sell-off, which could positively impact Apple Inc. as a major player in the tech sector. The commentary from T. Rowe Price suggests that while there may be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. This could imply that Apple, which invests heavily in AI and technology, may benefit from increased demand and innovation in the sector. However, there is also a cautionary note regarding potential overconcentration and scaling back of investments by some tech players, which could create uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment appears to lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, but with some risk of volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are generally positive, highlighting Apple's historical success in creating wealth for investors. However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't contain any specific information about current or future performance. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as positive association, but the lack of concrete details limits the impact. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, with a slight bias towards a positive, but not significant, movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential threat posed by DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to Nvidia and other tech giants, including Apple.  While the article doesn't directly address Apple's specific vulnerabilities, the overall market reaction (Nasdaq down over 3%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) and the concern about slowing Big Tech earnings growth suggest a negative impact on the broader tech sector.  Apple, as a major tech company, is likely to be affected indirectly. The article highlights a shift away from Big Tech dominance, suggesting a potential decrease in Apple's outsized influence on market performance.  However, Apple's diverse product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate the negative impact to some extent.  Therefore, while a price drop is more likely due to the overall market sentiment and the threat to the AI sector, the probability of a significant fall is tempered by Apple's resilience.  The probability of a rise is low, given the negative market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov product and its partnership with the US government, which could be seen as a positive for the broader AI sector, including Apple (AAPL). However, the emergence of DeepSeek as a cost-efficient competitor has caused market volatility, particularly affecting AI-focused companies like Nvidia. Apple, which is not as heavily reliant on AI as some other tech giants, actually gained ground during the sell-off, as investors believe its platform could benefit from more cost-effective AI models. Given Apple's diversified business and the potential for cost savings from new AI technologies, the stock is more likely to rise than fall in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares following a sell-off triggered by a breakthrough from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. BofA analysts believe Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They cite several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investor confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications. Based on this positive outlook from BofA analysts and the company's recent stock performance, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI hardware super cycle. Cramer expresses skepticism about the consumer demand for AI PCs, citing a Morgan Stanley consumer survey that shows only 15% of respondents bought AI-enabled products primarily for AI features. However, Cramer remains positive about AI's potential in enterprise use cases and its applications in areas like healthcare. He also mentions that Apple's stock price may not be significantly affected by a potential earnings miss, as the consensus estimate is already low. Considering Cramer's mixed views on Apple and AI, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated based on the overall neutral tone of the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on AI and the impact of projects like Stargate on Apple Inc.'s stock. While Cramer praises Apple as a steady performer likened to a 'quarterback' in a portfolio, recent stock performance has been volatile with analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments impacting the stock. Cramer's positive views provide some support, but recent negative developments suggest ongoing market skepticism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential recovery in tech stocks following a sell-off, which could positively impact Apple Inc. as a major player in the tech sector. While there are concerns about AI spending and potential overconcentration in the sector, the medium-term outlook remains strong according to T. Rowe Price's commentary. This suggests that while there may be short-term volatility, the overall sentiment leans towards a positive outlook for Apple. However, the mixed predictions from other models indicate some uncertainty, particularly regarding the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the broader tech landscape. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, tempered by the potential for short-term consolidation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, highlighting Apple's past success in creating wealth. However, it's backward-looking and lacks specific details about current or future performance. The association with Nvidia and AMD is a positive signal, but the absence of concrete information limits the impact. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on Apple's resilience and potential in AI, while others predicted a fall due to market volatility and concerns about the tech sector. Given the limited new information and the existing mixed sentiment, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities towards a more neutral stance, leaning slightly positive due to the initial positive framing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential negative impact of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model on the broader tech sector, particularly Nvidia.  While Apple isn't directly targeted, the overall market reaction and concerns about slowing Big Tech earnings growth suggest a potential negative spillover effect.  The article highlights a potential shift away from Big Tech dominance, which could affect Apple's performance. However, Apple's diversified business and strong brand loyalty might mitigate the negative impact.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall.  Considering the overall market sentiment and the potential for reduced growth in the AI sector, a price drop is more likely than a rise. However, Apple's resilience and diversified portfolio suggest the drop won't be drastic. The consensus leans slightly towards a fall, but the probability isn't overwhelmingly high due to Apple's inherent strengths.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov product and its partnership with the US government, which could be seen as a positive for the broader AI sector, including Apple (AAPL).

However, it's a retrospective view and lacks specific details about Apple's current or future performance. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a rise based on Apple's resilience and potential in AI, while others predict a fall due to market volatility and concerns about the tech sector. Considering the limited new information and the existing mixed sentiment, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities towards a more neutral stance, leaning slightly positive due to the initial positive framing and the general upward trend in the previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential threat of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to the broader tech sector, particularly Nvidia.  While Apple isn't directly mentioned as a primary target, the negative market reaction and concerns about slowing Big Tech earnings growth suggest a potential negative impact on Apple.  The article highlights a potential shift away from Big Tech dominance, which could affect Apple's performance. However, Apple's diversified business, strong brand loyalty, and relatively less reliance on AI compared to Nvidia mitigate the potential negative impact.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  While some models predict a rise based on Apple's resilience and diversified portfolio, others predict a fall due to the overall market sentiment and concerns about the AI sector. Considering the overall market reaction, the potential for reduced growth in the AI sector, and the mixed predictions, a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock price is more likely than a significant rise. However, Apple's inherent strengths suggest the drop won't be drastic.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect this nuanced assessment, leaning slightly towards a fall but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to Apple's resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov product and its partnership with the US government, which could be seen as a positive for the broader AI sector, including Apple (AAPL).

The overall trend in previous predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of a price rise over the rounds.  Considering the market reaction, potential for reduced growth in the AI sector, and the mixed but slightly positive predictions, a neutral stance is warranted.  Apple's inherent strengths suggest a significant drop is unlikely, and its diversified portfolio and strong brand loyalty could buffer against negative market sentiment.
