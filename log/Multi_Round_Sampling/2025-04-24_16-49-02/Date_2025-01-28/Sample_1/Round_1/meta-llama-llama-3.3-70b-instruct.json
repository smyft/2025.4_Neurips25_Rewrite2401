(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential recovery in tech stocks after a sell-off, which could positively impact Apple Inc. as a major player in the tech sector. The commentary from T. Rowe Price suggests that while there may be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. This could imply that Apple, which invests heavily in AI and technology, may benefit from increased demand and innovation in the sector. However, there is also a cautionary note regarding potential overconcentration and scaling back of investments by some tech players, which could create uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment appears to lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, but with some risk of volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are generally positive, highlighting Apple's historical success in creating wealth for investors. However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't contain any specific information about current or future performance. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as positive association, but the lack of concrete details limits the impact. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, with a slight bias towards a positive, but not significant, movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential threat posed by DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to Nvidia and other tech giants, including Apple.  While the article doesn't directly address Apple's specific vulnerabilities, the overall market reaction (Nasdaq down over 3%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) and the concern about slowing Big Tech earnings growth suggest a negative impact on the broader tech sector.  Apple, as a major tech company, is likely to be affected indirectly. The article highlights a shift away from Big Tech dominance, suggesting a potential decrease in Apple's outsized influence on market performance.  However, Apple's diverse product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate the negative impact to some extent.  Therefore, while a price drop is more likely due to the overall market sentiment and the threat to the AI sector, the probability of a significant fall is tempered by Apple's resilience.  The probability of a rise is low, given the negative market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov product and its partnership with the US government, which could be seen as a positive for the broader AI sector, including Apple (AAPL). However, the emergence of DeepSeek as a cost-efficient competitor has caused market volatility, particularly affecting AI-focused companies like Nvidia. Apple, which is not as heavily reliant on AI as some other tech giants, actually gained ground during the sell-off, as investors believe its platform could benefit from more cost-effective AI models. Given Apple's diversified business and the potential for cost savings from new AI technologies, the stock is more likely to rise than fall in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares following a sell-off triggered by a breakthrough from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. BofA analysts believe Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They cite several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investor confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications. Based on this positive outlook from BofA analysts and the company's recent stock performance, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI hardware super cycle. Cramer expresses skepticism about the consumer demand for AI PCs, citing a Morgan Stanley consumer survey that shows only 15% of respondents bought AI-enabled products primarily for AI features. However, Cramer remains positive about AI's potential in enterprise use cases and its applications in areas like healthcare. He also mentions that Apple's stock price may not be significantly affected by a potential earnings miss, as the consensus estimate is already low. Considering Cramer's mixed views on Apple and AI, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated based on the overall neutral tone of the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on AI and the impact of projects like Stargate on Apple Inc.'s stock. While Cramer praises Apple as a steady performer likened to a 'quarterback' in a portfolio, recent stock performance has been volatile with analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments impacting the stock. Cramer's positive views provide some support, but recent negative developments suggest ongoing market skepticism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
