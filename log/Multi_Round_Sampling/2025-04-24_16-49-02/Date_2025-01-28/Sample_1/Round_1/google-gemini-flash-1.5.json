(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why DeepSeek has been so unsettling for the stock market in 3 charts\nNews Content: A cheaper, competitive AI model from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) on Monday as it challenged one of the key drivers of the current bull market.\n\nFor the first time in a while, investors had a tangible reason to believe some US tech giants, namely Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), might not grow earnings by as much as initially hoped in the coming year. The team behind DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence model maker, claimed that the technology uses cheaper chips and less data. Investors are concerned this could hurt future AI chip sales for a company like Nvidia as well as bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI.\n\nThe problem for markets is that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years.\n\n\"The key pillar of this bull market is earning estimates moving higher,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \"Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year.\"\n\nAs Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, Big Tech earnings from the giants \u2014 Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 have seen earnings estimates rise more than the rest of the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe (IEUR) index over the past 12 months.\n\nYesterday's more than 3% decline in the Nasdaq and 1.5% drop in the S&P 500 show how the market could react if both the blue (Big Tech earnings estimates) and green lines (the rest of S&P 500 estimates) in Krishna's chart below begin reversing direction.\n\nThe expected scrutiny over tech earnings will come amid a market that Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told Yahoo Finance is ripe for change. Bernstein'scontribution to Yahoo Finance's Chartbook showed how just 29% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024 and 30% outperformed in 2023. This marked the lowest number of outperformers since the late 1990s.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably incorrect that there is a new paradigm in which the 'Magnificent Seven' secularly dominate the market,\" Bernstein said. \"Such extreme, narrow leadership is rare because it goes against capitalism, open markets, and competition.\"\n\n\"We think 2025 [will] be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBernstein's call for broader returns in 2025 matches the takeaway from a chart shared with Yahoo Finance by Nicole Inui, HSBC's head of equity research for the Americas. Inui's chart shows that while Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow more than the other 493 stocks in the index in 2025, the gap is expected to narrow, making the case for a broadening of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Mag 7, while still outpacing the overall index on earnings growth, is expected to be less of an outlier.\"\n\nTo both Bernstein and Inui's credit, that market action played out on Monday. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Nvidia's large losses led to most of the downside action in the overall index.\n\nThis introduces a stark reality for investors. Should Big Tech's dominance wane, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500. But it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Jan. 15, 2025, in New York City.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential recovery in tech stocks after a sell-off, which could positively impact Apple Inc. as a major player in the tech sector. The commentary from T. Rowe Price suggests that while there may be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. This could imply that Apple, which invests heavily in AI and technology, may benefit from increased demand and innovation in the sector. However, there is also a cautionary note regarding potential overconcentration and scaling back of investments by some tech players, which could create uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment appears to lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, but with some risk of volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are generally positive, highlighting Apple's historical success in creating wealth for investors. However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't contain any specific information about current or future performance. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as positive association, but the lack of concrete details limits the impact. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, with a slight bias towards a positive, but not significant, movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential threat posed by DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to Nvidia and other tech giants, including Apple.  While the article doesn't directly address Apple's specific vulnerabilities, the overall market reaction (Nasdaq down over 3%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) and the concern about slowing Big Tech earnings growth suggest a negative impact on the broader tech sector.  Apple, as a major tech company, is likely to be affected indirectly. The article highlights a shift away from Big Tech dominance, suggesting a potential decrease in Apple's outsized influence on market performance.  However, Apple's diverse product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate the negative impact to some extent.  Therefore, while a price drop is more likely due to the overall market sentiment and the threat to the AI sector, the probability of a significant fall is tempered by Apple's resilience.  The probability of a rise is low, given the negative market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov product and its partnership with the US government, which could be seen as a positive for the broader AI sector, including Apple (AAPL). However, the emergence of DeepSeek as a cost-efficient competitor has caused market volatility, particularly affecting AI-focused companies like Nvidia. Apple, which is not as heavily reliant on AI as some other tech giants, actually gained ground during the sell-off, as investors believe its platform could benefit from more cost-effective AI models. Given Apple's diversified business and the potential for cost savings from new AI technologies, the stock is more likely to rise than fall in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares following a sell-off triggered by a breakthrough from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. BofA analysts believe Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They cite several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investor confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications. Based on this positive outlook from BofA analysts and the company's recent stock performance, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI hardware super cycle. Cramer expresses skepticism about the consumer demand for AI PCs, citing a Morgan Stanley consumer survey that shows only 15% of respondents bought AI-enabled products primarily for AI features. However, Cramer remains positive about AI's potential in enterprise use cases and its applications in areas like healthcare. He also mentions that Apple's stock price may not be significantly affected by a potential earnings miss, as the consensus estimate is already low. Considering Cramer's mixed views on Apple and AI, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated based on the overall neutral tone of the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on AI and the impact of projects like Stargate on Apple Inc.'s stock. While Cramer praises Apple as a steady performer likened to a 'quarterback' in a portfolio, recent stock performance has been volatile with analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments impacting the stock. Cramer's positive views provide some support, but recent negative developments suggest ongoing market skepticism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
