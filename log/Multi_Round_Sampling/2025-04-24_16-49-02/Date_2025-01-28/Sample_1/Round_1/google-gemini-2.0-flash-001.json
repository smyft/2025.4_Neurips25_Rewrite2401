      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks to Consider\nNews Content: Apple, Nvidia, and AMD minted a lot of millionaires over the past few decades.\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential recovery in tech stocks after a sell-off, which could positively impact Apple Inc. as a major player in the tech sector. The commentary from T. Rowe Price suggests that while there may be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. This could imply that Apple, which invests heavily in AI and technology, may benefit from increased demand and innovation in the sector. However, there is also a cautionary note regarding potential overconcentration and scaling back of investments by some tech players, which could create uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment appears to lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, but with some risk of volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are generally positive, highlighting Apple's historical success in creating wealth for investors. However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't contain any specific information about current or future performance. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as positive association, but the lack of concrete details limits the impact. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, with a slight bias towards a positive, but not significant, movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential threat posed by DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to Nvidia and other tech giants, including Apple.  While the article doesn't directly address Apple's specific vulnerabilities, the overall market reaction (Nasdaq down over 3%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) and the concern about slowing Big Tech earnings growth suggest a negative impact on the broader tech sector.  Apple, as a major tech company, is likely to be affected indirectly. The article highlights a shift away from Big Tech dominance, suggesting a potential decrease in Apple's outsized influence on market performance.  However, Apple's diverse product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate the negative impact to some extent.  Therefore, while a price drop is more likely due to the overall market sentiment and the threat to the AI sector, the probability of a significant fall is tempered by Apple's resilience.  The probability of a rise is low, given the negative market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov product and its partnership with the US government, which could be seen as a positive for the broader AI sector, including Apple (AAPL). However, the emergence of DeepSeek as a cost-efficient competitor has caused market volatility, particularly affecting AI-focused companies like Nvidia. Apple, which is not as heavily reliant on AI as some other tech giants, actually gained ground during the sell-off, as investors believe its platform could benefit from more cost-effective AI models. Given Apple's diversified business and the potential for cost savings from new AI technologies, the stock is more likely to rise than fall in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Bank of America (BofA) sees a buying opportunity in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares following a sell-off triggered by a breakthrough from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. BofA analysts believe Apple's defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility make it an attractive buy. They cite several key drivers that could drive upside in Apple's shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE, insourcing of modem production, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025. Additionally, Apple's stock was up 3% on Monday when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, indicating investor confidence in the company's earnings resiliency and potential for edge AI applications. Based on this positive outlook from BofA analysts and the company's recent stock performance, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI hardware super cycle. Cramer expresses skepticism about the consumer demand for AI PCs, citing a Morgan Stanley consumer survey that shows only 15% of respondents bought AI-enabled products primarily for AI features. However, Cramer remains positive about AI's potential in enterprise use cases and its applications in areas like healthcare. He also mentions that Apple's stock price may not be significantly affected by a potential earnings miss, as the consensus estimate is already low. Considering Cramer's mixed views on Apple and AI, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated based on the overall neutral tone of the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on AI and the impact of projects like Stargate on Apple Inc.'s stock. While Cramer praises Apple as a steady performer likened to a 'quarterback' in a portfolio, recent stock performance has been volatile with analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments impacting the stock. Cramer's positive views provide some support, but recent negative developments suggest ongoing market skepticism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
