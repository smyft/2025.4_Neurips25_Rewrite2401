(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, which positions OpenAI as a key player in the government sector, potentially increasing demand for AI technologies. While the emergence of DeepSeek has caused initial panic in the market, it may also lead to increased competition and innovation, which could benefit established companies like Apple. The overall sentiment suggests that while there may be short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple could be positive as they adapt to a more competitive landscape. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are generally positive, highlighting Apple's historical success in creating wealth for investors. However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't contain any specific information about current or future performance. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as positive association, but the lack of concrete details limits the impact. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, with a slight bias towards a positive, but not significant, movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Zacks analyst blog presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report low to mid-single-digit revenue growth and a slight increase in earnings, key concerns exist.  iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  However, the Services segment is expected to show strong double-digit growth.  The Mac segment also shows positive growth.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a significant negative factor, suggesting analysts believe the stock is overvalued and poised for a decline.  The article highlights a stretched valuation (Value Score of F) and underperformance compared to the sector. While the AI push with Apple Intelligence is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds in China and the delayed launch of Apple Intelligence outweigh the positives in the short term. Considering the mixed signals and the strong negative signal from the Zacks Rank, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently overvalued, with concerns about future tax rates and geopolitical risks affecting its supply chain. Additionally, Warren Buffett's significant reduction in holdings suggests a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term prospects. However, Apple has strong product rollouts and growth in service revenue, which could support the stock price. The mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not directly mention Apple Inc. or provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or future outlook. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, is known to have significant investments in various companies, including Apple. However, without specific details on Berkshire Hathaway's current holdings or actions related to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. Given that the news does not provide negative information about Apple, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising, albeit still a small one, as the general market sentiment and other factors might still influence the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of DeepSeek AI on Big Tech's spending on AI. While there may be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook remains strong. The article quotes a portfolio manager suggesting that AI spending could actually increase in the medium term, which could benefit companies like Nvidia. However, the article also mentions that some tech players may scale back their investments. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to slightly positive for Apple Inc., as it is a major player in the tech industry and may benefit from increased AI spending. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on AI and the impact of projects like Stargate on Apple Inc.'s stock. While Cramer praises Apple as a steady performer likened to a 'quarterback' in a portfolio, recent stock performance has been volatile with analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments impacting the stock. Cramer's positive views provide some support, but recent negative developments suggest ongoing market skepticism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, which positions OpenAI as a key player in the government sector, potentially increasing demand for AI technologies. While the emergence of DeepSeek has caused initial panic in the market, it may also lead to increased competition and innovation, which could benefit established companies like Apple. The mixed predictions from previous rounds indicate a range of sentiments, with some analysts seeing potential for growth due to increased AI spending, while others express concerns about competition and valuation. Overall, the sentiment leans slightly positive for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise despite some short-term volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, associating Apple with 'millionaire-maker' stocks. However, it's backward-looking and lacks specific details about Apple's current financial situation or future prospects. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price decrease due to concerns about valuation, competition, and analyst ratings. Others are more optimistic, citing Apple's potential in AI and overall market strength. Considering the lack of concrete, forward-looking information in the current news and the existing mixed sentiment, I'll slightly favor a price rise, but not significantly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for AAPL. While projected revenue growth is modest and earnings are expected to increase slightly, significant concerns exist.  A projected decline in iPhone sales due to Chinese competition and a delayed Apple Intelligence launch are major headwinds.  Counterbalancing this is strong projected growth in the Services segment and positive Mac sales. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a strong negative indicator, suggesting overvaluation and potential decline.  The report also highlights a stretched valuation and underperformance relative to the sector.  While the AI push is positive long-term, near-term headwinds in China and the delayed Apple Intelligence launch appear to outweigh the positives in the short term.  Considering the mixed signals and the negative Zacks Rank, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to long-term AI potential and others predicting a fall due to near-term challenges.  I'm weighting the Zacks Rank heavily due to its professional analysis and the near-term focus of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings, citing overvaluation and tax concerns, which could signal a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term prospects. Additionally, geopolitical risks, antitrust concerns, and potential supply chain disruptions add to the negative sentiment. However, Apple's strong product pipeline, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence, along with expected service revenue growth, provide some positive counterpoints. The mixed signals from previous predictions, with a slight lean towards negative sentiment, suggest cautious optimism but with higher risks. Given the overvaluation and Buffett's exit, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not directly mention Apple Inc. or provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or future outlook. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, is known to have significant investments in various companies, including Apple. However, without specific details on Berkshire Hathaway's current holdings or actions related to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price.

However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't offer any specific insights into Apple's current or future performance. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment. Some models lean towards a price decrease due to concerns about valuation, competition, and analyst ratings (Zacks Rank). Others are more optimistic, citing Apple's potential in AI and overall market strength. Considering the lack of concrete, forward-looking information in the current news and the existing mixed sentiment, I'll slightly favor a price rise, but not significantly. The positive association with Nvidia and AMD, which are currently strong performers, provides a slight boost to the probability of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks analyst report presents a mixed outlook for Apple.
