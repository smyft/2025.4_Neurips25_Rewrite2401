(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, which positions OpenAI as a key player in the government sector, potentially increasing demand for AI technologies. While the emergence of DeepSeek has caused initial panic in the market, it may also lead to increased competition and innovation, which could benefit established companies like Apple. The overall sentiment suggests that while there may be short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for companies like Apple could be positive as they adapt to a more competitive landscape. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are generally positive, highlighting Apple's historical success in creating wealth for investors. However, it's a retrospective view and doesn't contain any specific information about current or future performance. The mention alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as positive association, but the lack of concrete details limits the impact. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, with a slight bias towards a positive, but not significant, movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Zacks analyst blog presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report low to mid-single-digit revenue growth and a slight increase in earnings, key concerns exist.  iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  However, the Services segment is expected to show strong double-digit growth.  The Mac segment also shows positive growth.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a significant negative factor, suggesting analysts believe the stock is overvalued and poised for a decline.  The article highlights a stretched valuation (Value Score of F) and underperformance compared to the sector. While the AI push with Apple Intelligence is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds in China and the delayed launch of Apple Intelligence outweigh the positives in the short term. Considering the mixed signals and the strong negative signal from the Zacks Rank, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently overvalued, with concerns about future tax rates and geopolitical risks affecting its supply chain. Additionally, Warren Buffett's significant reduction in holdings suggests a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term prospects. However, Apple has strong product rollouts and growth in service revenue, which could support the stock price. The mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?' does not directly mention Apple Inc. or provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or future outlook. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, is known to have significant investments in various companies, including Apple. However, without specific details on Berkshire Hathaway's current holdings or actions related to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. Given that the news does not provide negative information about Apple, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising, albeit still a small one, as the general market sentiment and other factors might still influence the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of DeepSeek AI on Big Tech's spending on AI. While there may be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook remains strong. The article quotes a portfolio manager suggesting that AI spending could actually increase in the medium term, which could benefit companies like Nvidia. However, the article also mentions that some tech players may scale back their investments. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to slightly positive for Apple Inc., as it is a major player in the tech industry and may benefit from increased AI spending. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on AI and the impact of projects like Stargate on Apple Inc.'s stock. While Cramer praises Apple as a steady performer likened to a 'quarterback' in a portfolio, recent stock performance has been volatile with analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments impacting the stock. Cramer's positive views provide some support, but recent negative developments suggest ongoing market skepticism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
