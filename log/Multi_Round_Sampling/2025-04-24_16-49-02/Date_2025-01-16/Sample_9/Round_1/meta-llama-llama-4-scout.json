(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 9 of the 10 Largest Companies in the World Are Making Big Moves Into AI. Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention.\nNews Content: It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Apple's credit card partnership transition adds to investor concerns. Analysts predict a potential 10% drop in iPhone shipments for 2025, and external factors like tariffs could further complicate the situation. While Apple remains a dominant player with a strong market cap, the combination of declining sales, competitive pressures, and strategic uncertainties suggests a higher likelihood of stock price decline than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative development for Apple: losing market share in China, a crucial market for the company. The fact that local competitors, Vivo and Huawei, have surpassed Apple in sales suggests increased competition and potentially weakening brand appeal or pricing issues. This loss of market share directly impacts revenue projections and investor sentiment, making a stock price decrease more likely. While Apple is a large, diversified company and this is just one market, China's importance makes this a significant concern. The lack of specific sales figures or details about Apple's response makes a precise probability difficult, but the overall tone is clearly negative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China, is a positive development, but its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, one of its key markets, due to increased competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei. Apple's shipments dropped by 17%, while competitors saw substantial growth. This suggests potential revenue and profit challenges for Apple in the region, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the premarket trading reaction and the competitive pressures, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of AI in the market and how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are making significant moves in this area. Apple's development of Apple Intelligence and its inclusion in their software provides a strong indication that the company is heavily investing in AI technology, which could potentially drive growth and increase its stock value. The article also mentions that the AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030, suggesting a positive outlook for companies involved in AI, such as Apple. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech industry and is making strides in AI, it is likely that their stock price will benefit from this trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and market share in the region. Although the overall smartphone market in China is growing, Apple's loss of market share and decline in shipments are likely to have a negative effect on investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in the company's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is quite broad and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.'s involvement or plans regarding the Metaverse. Without concrete information about how Apple is positioning itself in the Metaverse space, it's difficult to assess the direct impact on its stock price. However, since Apple is a major technology player and any significant developments in emerging technologies like the Metaverse could be seen positively by investors, there might be a slight positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
