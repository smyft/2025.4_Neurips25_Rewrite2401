(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's China Nightmare: iPhone Sales Plummet as Huawei Surges -- Is the Empire Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Apple's credit card partnership transition adds to investor concerns. Analysts predict a potential 10% drop in iPhone shipments for 2025, and external factors like tariffs could further complicate the situation. While Apple remains a dominant player with a strong market cap, the combination of declining sales, competitive pressures, and strategic uncertainties suggests a higher likelihood of stock price decline than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative development for Apple: losing market share in China, a crucial market for the company. The fact that local competitors, Vivo and Huawei, have surpassed Apple in sales suggests increased competition and potentially weakening brand appeal or pricing issues. This loss of market share directly impacts revenue projections and investor sentiment, making a stock price decrease more likely. While Apple is a large, diversified company and this is just one market, China's importance makes this a significant concern. The lack of specific sales figures or details about Apple's response makes a precise probability difficult, but the overall tone is clearly negative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China, is a positive development, but its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, one of its key markets, due to increased competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei. Apple's shipments dropped by 17%, while competitors saw substantial growth. This suggests potential revenue and profit challenges for Apple in the region, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the premarket trading reaction and the competitive pressures, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of AI in the market and how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are making significant moves in this area. Apple's development of Apple Intelligence and its inclusion in their software provides a strong indication that the company is heavily investing in AI technology, which could potentially drive growth and increase its stock value. The article also mentions that the AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030, suggesting a positive outlook for companies involved in AI, such as Apple. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech industry and is making strides in AI, it is likely that their stock price will benefit from this trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and market share in the region. Although the overall smartphone market in China is growing, Apple's loss of market share and decline in shipments are likely to have a negative effect on investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in the company's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is quite broad and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.'s involvement or plans regarding the Metaverse. Without concrete information about how Apple is positioning itself in the Metaverse space, it's difficult to assess the direct impact on its stock price. However, since Apple is a major technology player and any significant developments in emerging technologies like the Metaverse could be seen positively by investors, there might be a slight positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
