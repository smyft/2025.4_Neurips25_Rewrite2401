A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Apple's credit card partnership transition adds to investor concerns. Analysts predict a potential 10% drop in iPhone shipments for 2025, and external factors like tariffs could further complicate the situation. While Apple remains a dominant player with a strong market cap, the combination of declining sales, competitive pressures, and strategic uncertainties suggests a higher likelihood of stock price decline than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative development for Apple: losing market share in China, a crucial market for the company. The fact that local competitors, Vivo and Huawei, have surpassed Apple in sales suggests increased competition and potentially weakening brand appeal or pricing issues. This loss of market share directly impacts revenue projections and investor sentiment, making a stock price decrease more likely. While Apple is a large, diversified company and this is just one market, China's importance makes this a significant concern. The lack of specific sales figures or details about Apple's response makes a precise probability difficult, but the overall tone is clearly negative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China, is a positive development, but its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, one of its key markets, due to increased competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei. Apple's shipments dropped by 17%, while competitors saw substantial growth. This suggests potential revenue and profit challenges for Apple in the region, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the premarket trading reaction and the competitive pressures, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of AI in the market and how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are making significant moves in this area. Apple's development of Apple Intelligence and its inclusion in their software provides a strong indication that the company is heavily investing in AI technology, which could potentially drive growth and increase its stock value. The article also mentions that the AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030, suggesting a positive outlook for companies involved in AI, such as Apple. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech industry and is making strides in AI, it is likely that their stock price will benefit from this trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and market share in the region. Although the overall smartphone market in China is growing, Apple's loss of market share and decline in shipments are likely to have a negative effect on investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in the company's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is quite broad and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.'s involvement or plans regarding the Metaverse. Without concrete information about how Apple is positioning itself in the Metaverse space, it's difficult to assess the direct impact on its stock price. However, since Apple is a major technology player and any significant developments in emerging technologies like the Metaverse could be seen positively by investors, there might be a slight positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, particularly in the Chinese market where iPhone sales have plummeted by 25% year-over-year, and local competitors like Huawei are gaining market share. The uncertainty surrounding Apple's credit card partnership transition adds to investor concerns. Analysts predict a potential 10% drop in iPhone shipments for 2025, and external factors such as potential tariffs could further complicate the situation. While Apple remains a dominant player with a strong market cap, the combination of declining sales, competitive pressures, and strategic uncertainties suggests a higher likelihood of stock price decline than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates a negative trend for Apple in a crucial market, China. Losing the top spot to local competitors like Vivo and Huawei signals weakening market share and increased competition. This is further substantiated by the reported 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales mentioned in Round 0. While some models in Round 0 considered other factors like AI investment or new store openings, the primary concern remains the loss of market share in China. Considering the previous predictions, especially the initial strong negative sentiment, and the lack of any offsetting positive news, the probability of the stock price falling remains high. The slight increase in some models' 'rising' probability in Round 0 seems to be based on unrelated news or general market trends, which are less relevant than the direct negative impact of the China news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news describes the opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China. While this is positive in terms of expansion and brand presence, the impact on Apple's overall stock price is likely to be minimal.  The event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's global operations and revenue.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty about Apple's performance in the Chinese market. Some models highlight concerns about declining market share and competition from local brands.  However, the new store opening is a neutral to slightly positive event, unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment in the short term.  Considering the previous predictions and the limited impact of a single store opening, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the effect is expected to be small and easily overshadowed by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, a critical market for the company, with a 17% drop in iPhone shipments and a loss of the top spot to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. This decline is attributed to increased competition from local brands offering advanced AI features and custom operating systems, which are resonating more with Chinese consumers. The premarket trading reaction shows a fractional slip, indicating initial negative investor sentiment. Given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's revenue and the competitive pressures, the likelihood of a stock price decline is higher. However, Apple's strong global brand and diversified product portfolio may mitigate some of the negative impact, but the immediate reaction is likely to be negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and market share in the region. Although the overall smartphone market in China is growing, Apple's loss of market share and decline in shipments are likely to have a negative effect on investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in the company's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise due to this news. However, the probabilities of stock price movement can be influenced by various factors, including the company's overall financial performance, industry trends, and market conditions. Given the information provided, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is vague and does not provide specific details about Apple's involvement or plans related to the Metaverse. Previous predictions have been mixed, with some indicating a potential negative impact due to market share losses in China and competitive pressures, while others suggest a positive outlook based on investments in AI. Given the lack of concrete information about Apple's Metaverse efforts, it is challenging to determine a clear direction. However, considering the mixed signals and the historical trends pointing towards negative sentiments, the probability of a decline seems slightly higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, particularly in the Chinese market where iPhone sales have plummeted by 25% year-over-year, and local competitors like Huawei are gaining market share. The uncertainty surrounding Apple's credit card partnership transition adds to investor concerns. Analysts predict a potential 10% drop in iPhone shipments for 2025, and external factors such as potential tariffs could further complicate the situation. While Apple remains a dominant player with a strong market cap, the combination of declining sales, competitive pressures, and strategic uncertainties suggests a higher likelihood of stock price decline than rise. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates a negative trend for Apple, specifically the loss of market share in China to local competitors like Vivo and Huawei. This is a significant concern as China is a crucial market for Apple. The previous rounds of predictions largely reflect this negative sentiment, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. While some models considered other factors like AI investment, the primary concern remains the loss of market share in China. Considering the consistent negative sentiment and the lack of any offsetting positive news, the probability of the stock price falling remains high. The trend in previous predictions shows a strengthening of the negative outlook, further supporting a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news is about the opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China.  This is a positive development, signifying continued investment and expansion in a key market. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term. The event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, largely driven by concerns about declining market share in China and increased competition.  While the new store opening is a positive sign, it's unlikely to significantly outweigh the negative sentiment stemming from those larger market trends. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a stock price remaining stable or experiencing a minor, temporary increase, rather than a significant rise or fall. The overall impact is likely to be muted by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, a critical market, with a 17% drop in iPhone shipments and losing the top spot to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. This indicates increased competition and potential revenue challenges. The premarket trading reaction shows a fractional slip, suggesting initial negative investor sentiment. While Apple's strong global brand and diversified portfolio may mitigate some impact, the immediate reaction is likely negative. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, aligning with the negative news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of AI in the market and how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are making significant moves in this area. Apple's development of Apple Intelligence and its inclusion in their software provides a strong indication that the company is heavily investing in AI technology, which could potentially drive growth and increase its stock value. However, the previous predictions and the context provided indicate a mixed sentiment with a generally negative outlook due to concerns about Apple's market share in China and competition from local brands. Considering the AI investment as a positive factor but also taking into account the negative sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and market share in the region.

Previous predictions have been mixed, with several indicating a potential negative impact due to market share losses in China and competitive pressures. However, there are also some predictions based on the potential positive impact of Apple's investments in AI. Given the conflicting signals and historical trends pointing towards negative sentiments, the probability of a decline seems slightly higher, but it is balanced by the potential for positive sentiments from emerging technologies.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, particularly in the Chinese market where iPhone sales have plummeted by 25% year-over-year, and local competitors like Huawei are gaining market share.

Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative news regarding Apple's declining market share in China, coupled with the rise of local competitors like Vivo and Huawei, strongly suggests a negative impact on the stock price. Previous predictions across multiple rounds have largely reflected this sentiment, with a clear trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. While some models have considered potentially positive factors like AI investments, the dominant concern remains the loss of market share in a crucial market like China. The 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales further reinforces this negative outlook. Therefore, I maintain a high probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about the opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China, is a positive development, signaling continued investment and expansion in a key market. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term.  The event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue. Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, largely driven by concerns about declining market share in China and increased competition.  These concerns are more significant than the impact of a single new store opening.  While the new store opening is a positive sign, it's unlikely to significantly outweigh the negative sentiment stemming from the larger market trends. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is low, and the probability of a fall or no significant change is higher.  The overall impact is likely to be muted by other market factors.  The consensus from previous models, which largely focused on negative news regarding Apple's performance in China, further supports this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, a critical market, with a 17% drop in iPhone shipments and losing the top spot to local competitors Vivo and Huawei.
