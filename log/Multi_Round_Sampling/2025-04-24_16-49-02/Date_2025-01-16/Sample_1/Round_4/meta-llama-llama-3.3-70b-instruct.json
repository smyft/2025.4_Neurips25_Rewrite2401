(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline raises a question about potential concerns regarding Apple, which may lead to investor anxiety. Such uncertainty can often result in a negative sentiment towards the stock, leading to a higher probability of a price decline. However, without specific details indicating a significant issue, the overall impact may be moderate. Therefore, while there is a notable chance of a price drop, the possibility of a price rise remains due to Apple's strong market position and historical resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is exploring new credit card partnerships with Barclays and Synchrony. This could be a positive development as it indicates Apple's continued interest in expanding its financial services offerings and potentially reaching a wider customer base. However, the full article is behind a paywall, so the details of the discussions (e.g., potential terms, exclusivity, etc.) are unknown. Without these details, it's difficult to assess the potential impact on Apple's stock price with high certainty. A partnership could increase revenue and customer loyalty, leading to a stock price increase. However, if the terms are unfavorable or the partnership doesn't materialize, the impact could be neutral or slightly negative. Given the limited information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, but acknowledging the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the significant drop in iPhone sales in China and the potential credit card partner transition are negative factors, Apple's overall market dominance, strong brand loyalty, and massive market capitalization suggest resilience. The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro headset and Apple Intelligence is concerning, but not necessarily a death knell.  The potential for further tariffs adds uncertainty.  Weighing these factors, the negative news is substantial enough to suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong given Apple's overall market position.  The probability estimates reflect this balance, with a higher probability assigned to a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed performance for Apple in China's smartphone market. While Apple recaptured the top spot in Q4 2024, its annual shipments fell by 17%, dropping to third place behind Vivo and Huawei. The decline in shipments, especially the 25% drop in Q4, indicates significant competitive pressure from domestic players like Huawei, which saw a 24% YoY growth in Q4 and 37% for the full year. The US-China tensions and patriotic rallying around Huawei further exacerbate Apple's challenges. However, Apple's efforts to enhance retail experiences, offer discounts, and expand financing options may mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the negative aspects (declining market share, competitive pressure) outweigh the positive (Q4 market leadership, strategic adjustments), suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs. This development could be seen as a strategic move to strengthen Apple's financial services offerings, particularly in the realm of credit cards. The involvement of Barclays and Synchrony could bring new dynamics to Apple's financial products and services. Given that this news does not inherently imply a negative outcome for Apple's stock and could potentially be viewed as a positive step in diversifying and enhancing its financial services, there is a likelihood of a positive stock price movement. However, the actual impact depends on various factors including investor perception, market competition, and the execution of the partnership.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses TSMC's upbeat outlook, which is likely to have a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple. The article mentions that TSMC's strong performance has buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle, which could drive growth for Apple. Additionally, TSMC's projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure are ahead of analysts' estimates, indicating a positive trend. However, the article also mentions uncertainties stemming from the US-China tech conflict, which could potentially disrupt supply chains and impact Apple's sales. Overall, the positive outlook from TSMC and the potential for growth in AI spending are likely to outweigh the negative factors, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's market share in China's smartphone market declined in 2024 compared to the previous year, falling behind competitors like Huawei and Vivo. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows a decline in shipments, which could indicate potential challenges in maintaining market leadership. Additionally, increased domestic competition and geopolitical factors may further impact sales. However, Apple is taking steps to counteract these issues, such as offering discounts and enhancing retail experiences, which may help stabilize or even improve market position.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline raises a serious question about potential concerns regarding Apple, which may lead to investor anxiety and uncertainty. This sentiment is likely to result in a higher probability of a price decline. However, considering Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and historical resilience, there remains a possibility for a price rise, albeit lower. The mixed signals from previous predictions, with some indicating potential positive developments in financial services, suggest that while there are concerns, the overall impact may not be overwhelmingly negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall due to the uncertainty raised by the headline, but still acknowledge a chance for a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is exploring new credit card partnerships with Barclays and Synchrony. This could be a positive development as it indicates Apple's continued interest in expanding its financial services offerings. However, the full article is behind a paywall, so the details of the discussions are unknown. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models lean towards a price fall due to market competition and geopolitical factors, while others see potential for a rise due to strategic moves. Given the uncertainty and the mixed opinions, I'll slightly favor a price rise, but acknowledge the risk of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) is a major negative, exacerbated by Huawei's strong growth and the potential for further government subsidies to fuel competition.  The credit card partner transition adds uncertainty and potential disruption.  While Apple maintains its global dominance and boasts a strong ecosystem and brand loyalty, these factors are being challenged.  The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence further dampens the outlook.  The potential for Trump-era tariffs adds another layer of uncertainty.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise due to the potential positive aspects of the credit card partnership and Apple's overall strength, while others predict a fall due to the significant sales decline in China and other challenges. Considering the weight of negative news, particularly the substantial drop in Chinese sales, and the uncertainty surrounding the credit card partnership and potential tariffs, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term. However, Apple's long-term prospects remain strong due to its brand and ecosystem, mitigating the potential for a drastic fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's mixed performance in China's smartphone market, with a significant decline in shipments (25% in Q4 and 17% annually) and a drop to third place behind Huawei and Vivo.

Apple's strategic efforts, such as discounts and retail enhancements, may mitigate some negative impacts, but the declining market share and competitive challenges are significant. Given the negative aspects outweigh the positives, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs. This development can be viewed as a strategic move to strengthen Apple's financial services offerings. While the partnership discussions do not inherently imply a negative outcome, they also do not provide clear, immediate benefits. The impact on the stock price will likely depend on investor perception of how this partnership could enhance Apple's financial services and overall ecosystem. Given the mixed implications and the lack of detailed information, there is a balance between potential positive and negative impacts. However, considering Apple's strong market position and the potential for growth in financial services, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses TSMC's upbeat outlook, which is likely to have a positive impact on Apple Inc.

The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a majority leaning towards a lower stock price due to the competitive pressures and declining market share.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline raises concerns about Apple's current market position, particularly in light of declining iPhone sales in China and increased competition from domestic brands. This uncertainty is likely to lead to investor anxiety, resulting in a higher probability of a price decline. However, there are also positive aspects, such as potential new credit card partnerships that could enhance Apple's financial services.

Therefore, I will increase the probability of stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) is a major negative, amplified by Huawei's growth and potential government subsidies favoring domestic brands. The credit card partner transition adds uncertainty. While Apple retains global dominance, a strong ecosystem, and brand loyalty, these are being challenged.  Lukewarm reception of new products (Vision Pro, Apple Intelligence) further dampens the outlook.  Potential tariffs add uncertainty.  Previous predictions are mixed, some seeing potential positives in the credit card partnership and Apple's overall strength, others predicting a fall due to the Chinese sales decline and other challenges.  Considering the weight of negative news, especially the substantial Chinese sales drop, and uncertainty surrounding the credit card partnership and tariffs, the probability of a price fall is higher in the short term. However, Apple's long-term prospects remain strong due to its brand and ecosystem, mitigating the potential for a drastic fall. The consensus from previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, and I'm adjusting my prediction slightly downward to reflect this, while still acknowledging Apple's inherent resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's mixed performance in China's smartphone market, with a significant decline in shipments (25% in Q4 and 17% annually) and a drop to third place behind Huawei and Vivo.
