(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\nNews Content: Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline raises a question about potential concerns regarding Apple, which may lead to investor anxiety. Such uncertainty can often result in a negative sentiment towards the stock, leading to a higher probability of a price decline. However, without specific details indicating a significant issue, the overall impact may be moderate. Therefore, while there is a notable chance of a price drop, the possibility of a price rise remains due to Apple's strong market position and historical resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is exploring new credit card partnerships with Barclays and Synchrony. This could be a positive development as it indicates Apple's continued interest in expanding its financial services offerings and potentially reaching a wider customer base. However, the full article is behind a paywall, so the details of the discussions (e.g., potential terms, exclusivity, etc.) are unknown. Without these details, it's difficult to assess the potential impact on Apple's stock price with high certainty. A partnership could increase revenue and customer loyalty, leading to a stock price increase. However, if the terms are unfavorable or the partnership doesn't materialize, the impact could be neutral or slightly negative. Given the limited information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, but acknowledging the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the significant drop in iPhone sales in China and the potential credit card partner transition are negative factors, Apple's overall market dominance, strong brand loyalty, and massive market capitalization suggest resilience. The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro headset and Apple Intelligence is concerning, but not necessarily a death knell.  The potential for further tariffs adds uncertainty.  Weighing these factors, the negative news is substantial enough to suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong given Apple's overall market position.  The probability estimates reflect this balance, with a higher probability assigned to a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed performance for Apple in China's smartphone market. While Apple recaptured the top spot in Q4 2024, its annual shipments fell by 17%, dropping to third place behind Vivo and Huawei. The decline in shipments, especially the 25% drop in Q4, indicates significant competitive pressure from domestic players like Huawei, which saw a 24% YoY growth in Q4 and 37% for the full year. The US-China tensions and patriotic rallying around Huawei further exacerbate Apple's challenges. However, Apple's efforts to enhance retail experiences, offer discounts, and expand financing options may mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the negative aspects (declining market share, competitive pressure) outweigh the positive (Q4 market leadership, strategic adjustments), suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs. This development could be seen as a strategic move to strengthen Apple's financial services offerings, particularly in the realm of credit cards. The involvement of Barclays and Synchrony could bring new dynamics to Apple's financial products and services. Given that this news does not inherently imply a negative outcome for Apple's stock and could potentially be viewed as a positive step in diversifying and enhancing its financial services, there is a likelihood of a positive stock price movement. However, the actual impact depends on various factors including investor perception, market competition, and the execution of the partnership.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses TSMC's upbeat outlook, which is likely to have a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple. The article mentions that TSMC's strong performance has buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle, which could drive growth for Apple. Additionally, TSMC's projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure are ahead of analysts' estimates, indicating a positive trend. However, the article also mentions uncertainties stemming from the US-China tech conflict, which could potentially disrupt supply chains and impact Apple's sales. Overall, the positive outlook from TSMC and the potential for growth in AI spending are likely to outweigh the negative factors, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's market share in China's smartphone market declined in 2024 compared to the previous year, falling behind competitors like Huawei and Vivo. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows a decline in shipments, which could indicate potential challenges in maintaining market leadership. Additionally, increased domestic competition and geopolitical factors may further impact sales. However, Apple is taking steps to counteract these issues, such as offering discounts and enhancing retail experiences, which may help stabilize or even improve market position.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
