(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. This decline in market share, coupled with a significant drop in shipments (25% year-on-year), suggests increased competition and challenges for Apple in a crucial market. Although Apple managed to lead in the fourth quarter, the overall trend for 2024 appears negative. The company's efforts to boost sales through discounts and improved retail experiences may not be sufficient to counteract the competitive pressures and declining shipments. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is very generic and lacks specific details about Apple's involvement. It doesn't specify the size of the investment, the specific metaverse companies Apple is investing in, or the strategic rationale behind the investment. Without concrete information, it's difficult to assess the potential impact on Apple's stock price. A general interest in the metaverse is already priced into many tech stocks. Therefore, the impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, but not significantly so. The lack of specifics makes a significant negative reaction unlikely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top spot in the Chinese smartphone market to Vivo and Huawei.  China is a significant market for Apple, and this loss of market share is negative news. However, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance might be limited, as China represents only a portion of Apple's global sales.  Furthermore, Apple's revenue is diversified across various product lines (iPads, Macs, services, etc.), reducing the impact of a single market's decline.  While the news is negative, the overall effect on the stock price is likely to be muted due to the diversification of Apple's business.  A small price drop is possible, but a significant fall is less likely given Apple's overall financial strength and the limited information available in the headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights TSMC's upbeat outlook, which is positive for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is its main chip supplier. TSMC's strong performance and increased capital expenditure suggest robust demand for AI and consumer electronics, which could benefit Apple's supply chain and future product offerings. However, the muted iPhone sales and geopolitical risks (US-China tech conflict) introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI spending and TSMC's performance is likely to outweigh the negatives for Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) dropped to third place in the mainland China's smartphone market with 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, and trailed behind Huawei and vivo in terms of growth and market share. Despite this, the overall market is expected to grow with a predicted 290 million units in 2025. However, the immediate impact of Apple's decreased market share and shipment drop in a crucial market, combined with increased competition, might negatively affect its stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that 9 out of the 10 largest companies in the world, including Apple Inc., are making significant investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This trend suggests a strategic move towards technological advancement and potential future growth. As AI is a rapidly growing field with immense potential for innovation and disruption, companies investing heavily in AI are likely to be seen as forward-thinking and competitive. This perception can positively impact investor confidence and, consequently, the stock price. Given that Apple is among these companies, it is reasonable to assume that its efforts in AI could lead to new products, services, or enhancements to existing ones, potentially increasing its revenue and market share. Therefore, the news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in Apple's smartphone market share in mainland China, where it has lost ground to competitors like Huawei and vivo. Despite Apple maintaining the top spot with 13.1 million devices sold, its sales decreased by 25% year-over-year, which is a concerning trend. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in stock price due to reduced market share and declining sales.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
