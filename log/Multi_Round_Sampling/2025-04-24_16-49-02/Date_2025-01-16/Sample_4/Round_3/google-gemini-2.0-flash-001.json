(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't\nNews Content: By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is in talks to replace Goldman Sachs with Barclays and Synchrony for its credit card partnership. This could be seen as a positive move, as it suggests Apple is seeking to improve its financial services and potentially enhance customer experience. If the partnership is successful, it could lead to increased revenue and customer loyalty, which may positively impact the stock price. However, there is also uncertainty involved in such negotiations, and if the talks do not lead to a favorable outcome, it could negatively affect investor sentiment. Overall, the news leans towards a positive outlook, but the uncertainty warrants a cautious approach.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications. While Apple is mentioned in the context of removing TikTok from its app store and ceasing updates, the overall impact on Apple's business is likely to be minimal. Apple is a large, diversified company, and the absence of TikTok from its app store is unlikely to significantly affect its revenue or user base. The article mentions that Apple declined to comment, suggesting they don't see this as a major issue. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement in either direction. However, there might be a slight negative sentiment due to the association with a controversial ban, but it's not expected to be substantial.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impending ban of TikTok in the US and the measures being taken to enforce it.  Apple's role is significant as it will be removing TikTok from its app store and will no longer distribute updates. While the direct financial impact on Apple from losing TikTok's app store revenue might be relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue, the news highlights Apple's compliance with US government regulations.  The potential for negative sentiment towards Apple due to the ban is low, as Apple is simply complying with the law.  There's no indication of any direct negative consequences for Apple's business or reputation.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price drop is low, and the probability of a price rise or remaining unchanged is higher.  The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a much larger impact on Apple's stock price than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, which could potentially expand its financial services portfolio and generate additional revenue streams. This is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it signals Apple's continued diversification and innovation in its business model. Such partnerships can enhance customer loyalty and provide new monetization opportunities, which are generally favorable for stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local companies Vivo and Huawei. This could potentially lead to a decrease in Apple's sales and revenue, which might negatively impact its stock price. The loss of market share in a significant region like China could raise concerns among investors about Apple's future growth prospects, leading to a decrease in its stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world, including Apple Inc., are making significant investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This trend suggests a strategic move towards technological advancement and potential future growth. As a leader in the tech industry, Apple's involvement in AI development could lead to innovative products and services, potentially increasing its competitiveness and revenue. Therefore, this news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in Apple's smartphone market share in China, where it has lost its top spot to local competitors like Vivo and Huawei. This negative market performance is likely to affect investor confidence and could result in a decrease in stock price. While Apple remains a strong global brand, the loss of market share in one of its major markets is a concerning trend. However, Apple's overall business is diversified, and this news may not have a long-term impact if the company can address these issues effectively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple being in talks with Barclays and Synchrony to replace Goldman Sachs for its credit card partnership suggests a strategic move to enhance its financial services. This could be perceived positively by investors as it indicates Apple's efforts to diversify its revenue streams and improve customer experience. While there is some uncertainty regarding the outcome of these negotiations, the overall sentiment leans towards a positive outlook, which is likely to support a rise in stock price. Considering previous predictions, the general trend indicates a more favorable view of Apple's potential growth from this partnership, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the TikTok ban in the US and Apple's role in it. Apple is required to remove TikTok from its app store and cease updates. While this might seem negative, the impact on Apple is likely minimal. Apple is simply complying with the law, and the loss of TikTok from its app store is unlikely to significantly affect its revenue or user base. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a rise due to other news (credit card partnership, AI investment) and others predicting a fall due to market share loss in China. Considering this news alone, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral to slightly negative. However, given the other factors at play (as indicated by previous rounds), I'll adjust the probabilities slightly to reflect a more balanced view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impending TikTok ban in the US and Apple's role in removing the app from its app store and ceasing updates.  While Apple's direct financial loss from this is likely minimal compared to its overall revenue, the event carries some indirect risk.  The ban itself is controversial, and negative sentiment associated with it *could* marginally impact Apple's stock price. However, Apple's compliance with the law is unlikely to be viewed negatively by investors.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news.  Given the minimal direct impact on Apple's financials and the likelihood that the market will quickly move past this event, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the lack of direct negative consequences for Apple and the potential for a neutral or even slightly positive reaction from investors who see Apple complying with regulations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership, which could be seen as a strategic move to enhance its financial services.

Given the overall positive sentiment from previous predictions (especially from models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct), and the fact that Apple is a diversified company with strong fundamentals, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The negative predictions from models like meta-llama/llama-4-scout and qwen/qwen-turbo seem to be based on unrelated news about market share loss in China, which is not relevant to this specific news headline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local companies Vivo and Huawei. This could potentially lead to a decrease in Apple's sales and revenue in China, which is a significant market for the company. The loss of market share in China might raise concerns among investors about Apple's future growth prospects, potentially leading to a decrease in its stock price. However, Apple is a diversified global company with a strong brand and presence in many markets, which might mitigate the negative impact. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed view on the stock price movement, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall. Given the negative tone of the news and its impact on Apple's market share, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world, including Apple Inc., are making significant investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
