(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market, with a significant drop in shipments and market share. This decline is attributed to strong competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei, which are gaining market share and innovating with new features. The overall growth in the Chinese smartphone market may not be enough to offset Apple's losses, leading to negative sentiment among investors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a broad trend of major companies investing in AI. While Apple is likely among the companies mentioned, the headline doesn't explicitly state Apple's specific AI initiatives or their scale. The positive sentiment surrounding AI investment generally benefits tech companies. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's AI strategy makes the impact less certain. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as the news is more about a general trend than a specific Apple announcement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\" is very general and doesn't provide any specific information about Apple Inc.  Apple's involvement in the metaverse is not a major focus of the company's current strategy, and this headline doesn't suggest any new developments or initiatives related to the metaverse from Apple. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price change is assumed to be close to the baseline probability of a price change on any given day, which is influenced by many other factors not mentioned in this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, along with other tech leaders, is engaging with President-elect Donald Trump, indicating a potential favorable relationship with the incoming administration. Historically, Cook has had a good relationship with Trump, which could bode well for Apple in terms of policy influence, especially regarding tariffs and antitrust issues. The tech industry's general alignment with Trump suggests a pro-business environment, which could benefit Apple. However, the news does not indicate any immediate financial or operational impact on Apple, making the effect on the stock price more speculative. Given the positive sentiment and potential for favorable policies, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the impact is likely to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local companies Vivo and Huawei. This development suggests a potential decline in Apple's market share and sales in a significant market, which could negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability. Therefore, the news is likely to be perceived as negative for Apple's stock price. The probability of the stock price rising due to this news is low, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. This loss of market share in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability, potentially leading to a decrease in its stock price. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in this information or that Apple's global brand and diverse product lineup could mitigate the impact of this news. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests concern or doubt about the current state or future prospects of Apple Inc. Such headlines typically evoke negative sentiments among investors, leading to potential selling pressure on the stock. The question posed in the headline implies uncertainty, which can be seen as a red flag for many investors. While it's important to consider various factors like company fundamentals, market conditions, and broader economic trends, the headline alone points towards a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its leading position in the Chinese smartphone market, with a significant drop in shipments and market share. This decline is attributed to strong competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei, which are innovating and gaining market share. The overall growth in the Chinese smartphone market may not be sufficient to offset Apple's losses, leading to negative sentiment among investors. Given the substantial impact of this news on Apple's market position and potential revenue, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline highlights a significant trend: major companies are investing heavily in AI. While the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple's specific AI initiatives, it's highly probable that Apple is among the companies making these moves, given its size and technological focus. This general trend is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as AI is seen as a growth area. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's AI strategy compared to its competitors makes the impact less certain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on negative news about Apple's market share in China, while others highlighted the positive aspects of AI investment. Given the general positive sentiment surrounding AI and the likelihood that Apple is involved, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the news is more about a general trend than a specific Apple announcement. I am also weighing in the previous predictions, and trying to be in the middle of the previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\" is too generic to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the lack of direct Apple-specific information in the provided news. Some models focused on negative news regarding Apple's market share in China, leading to predictions of a stock price fall. Others highlighted positive general trends in the tech sector (AI investment) or potential political advantages, leading to predictions of a rise.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the headline to Apple and the conflicting interpretations in previous predictions, I conclude that the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction.  Therefore, the probabilities are close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook's participation in President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, alongside other tech leaders, indicating a potential favorable relationship with the incoming administration. Historically, Cook has had a good relationship with Trump, which could benefit Apple in terms of policy influence, especially regarding tariffs and antitrust issues. The tech industry's general alignment with Trump suggests a pro-business environment, which could be positive for Apple. However, the news does not indicate any immediate financial or operational impact on Apple, making the effect on the stock price more speculative. Given the positive sentiment and potential for favorable policies, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the impact is likely to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local companies Vivo and Huawei. This development suggests a potential decline in Apple's market share and sales in a significant market, which could negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability. Therefore, the news is likely to be perceived as negative for Apple's stock price. Considering the competitive landscape and the importance of the Chinese market for Apple, the loss of the top position to local competitors could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a subsequent drop in the stock price. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in this information or that Apple's global brand and diverse product lineup could mitigate the impact of this news. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market to local brands Vivo and Huawei, which could negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus that this news is likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. The majority of the models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, with some models citing the potential decline in Apple's market share and sales in a significant market. Given this information, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline questions whether it is time to worry about Apple, suggesting concerns over its performance. Previous predictions have highlighted various factors affecting Apple's stock, such as market share losses in China, investor sentiment, and broader market perceptions. Many models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling based on negative sentiment stemming from various concerns. Given the recent trend and consistent predictions of a stock price fall, it is reasonable to lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
