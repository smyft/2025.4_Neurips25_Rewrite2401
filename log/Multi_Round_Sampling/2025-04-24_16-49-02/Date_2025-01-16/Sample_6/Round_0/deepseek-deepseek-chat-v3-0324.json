However, without more detailed content, it's challenging to assess the direct impact on Apple. Given Apple's significant reliance on components, any breakthroughs in China could potentially reduce costs or improve supply chain stability, which might be viewed positively. On the other hand, the mention of Apple's first US chips could imply a strategic shift towards domestic production, which might be seen as a positive move for resilience but could also involve higher costs initially.
