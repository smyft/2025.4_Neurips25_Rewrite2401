(AAPL)\nNews Headline: China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips\nNews Content: Hi everyone! This is Lauly from Taipei. I hope 2025 has been kind to you so far.I am writing this week\u2019s newsletter having just finished\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this Financial Times article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription? Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant moves that major companies, including Apple, are making into AI, which is currently a driving force in the market. The emphasis on AI's growth potential and the stability of established companies like Apple suggests a positive outlook for its stock price. Additionally, the article encourages investors to consider AI-driven stocks, which may lead to increased buying interest in Apple. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is expanding its retail presence in China, specifically opening its first store in Anhui province. This expansion suggests continued growth and investment in a key market. The store opening is timed around Chinese New Year, a period of high consumer spending, and includes special edition products and workshops tailored to the holiday. The news also highlights Apple's latest products, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Vision Pro, which could drive sales. While a single store opening is unlikely to cause a massive surge in stock price, it signals positive momentum and commitment to the Chinese market. Therefore, the probability of a slight rise is higher than a fall. However, the impact is likely to be small, so the probability is not overwhelmingly high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the significant drop in iPhone sales in China and the potential credit card partner transition are negative factors, Apple's overall market dominance, strong brand loyalty, and massive market capitalization suggest resilience. The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro headset and Apple Intelligence is concerning, but not necessarily a death knell.  The potential for further tariffs adds uncertainty.  Weighing these factors, the negative news is substantial enough to suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong given Apple's overall market position.  The probability estimates reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, indicating potential developments in the semiconductor industry that could impact Apple's supply chain or component costs. However, without more detailed content, it's challenging to assess the direct impact on Apple. Given Apple's significant reliance on components, any breakthroughs in China could potentially reduce costs or improve supply chain stability, which might be viewed positively. On the other hand, the mention of Apple's first US chips could imply a strategic shift towards domestic production, which might be seen as a positive move for resilience but could also involve higher costs initially. The overall impact is uncertain, but leaning slightly positive due to potential supply chain improvements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its plans to increase capital expenditure has positively impacted the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, especially for iPhone chips, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a stable or potentially increased demand for Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price may be moderate since the news is primarily about TSMC's performance and outlook. The overall sentiment suggests a positive impact on tech stocks due to sustained AI spending, but Apple's stock movement may also be influenced by its own product cycle and market conditions. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but the movement is likely to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok's operations and user base, rather than Apple's financials. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The opening of a new retail store in a strategic location in China signals Apple's continued investment and expansion in one of its key markets. This expansion typically leads to increased brand presence and potentially higher sales. Additionally, the timing around Chinese New Year adds a festive promotion element which could attract more customers. These factors generally have a positive impact on investor sentiment and could contribute to a potential stock price increase.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant moves that major companies, including Apple, are making into AI, which is a driving force in the market. The emphasis on AI's growth potential and the stability of established companies like Apple suggests a positive outlook for its stock price. The article encourages investors to consider AI-driven stocks, which may lead to increased buying interest in Apple. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news of Apple opening its first store in Anhui, China, is a positive signal. It demonstrates Apple's continued investment in a crucial market and its commitment to expanding its retail presence. The timing of the opening around Chinese New Year, along with special edition products and workshops, is likely to attract customers and boost sales. The store's design and features, such as the Genius Bar and Apple Pickup, enhance the customer experience. While a single store opening may not cause a dramatic surge in stock price, it contributes to positive momentum. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general consensus that this news is slightly positive. Therefore, I will adjust the probability of stock price rising to be slightly higher than the average of the previous rounds' predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) and the potential credit card partner transition are substantial negative factors, Apple's overall market dominance, massive market capitalization, and strong brand loyalty suggest a degree of resilience.  The lukewarm reception of new products and the potential for further tariffs add to the uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the ambiguity of the situation.  The significant negative news regarding China sales, however, outweighs the positive aspects of Apple's overall market position in the short term.  Considering the immediate impact of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty, the probability of a price fall is higher than a rise in the short term. However, Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, preventing an overwhelmingly negative prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, which could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, a memory breakthrough in China might improve supply chain efficiency or reduce costs, which could be positive for Apple. On the other hand, Apple's shift to US chips might involve higher initial costs or logistical challenges, which could be seen as a short-term negative. Given the lack of detailed content in the news, the overall impact is uncertain. However, considering Apple's strong market position and the potential long-term benefits of supply chain improvements, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. Previous predictions also show a mixed but generally slightly positive sentiment, with most models leaning towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its plans to increase capital expenditure has a positive impact on the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries.

However, as TikTok is a popular app available on the App Store, any disruption to its service could indirectly affect Apple. Considering the ban's primary impact is on TikTok and not directly on Apple, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is relatively low. The provided previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models suggest a low to moderate impact on Apple's stock price due to various pieces of news. Given the indirect nature of the impact and the lack of direct financial implications for Apple in this specific news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight leaning towards a stable or minor negative impact due to the potential for decreased user engagement with the App Store if popular apps like TikTok are banned.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's expansion into a new geographical market in China with the opening of a new store in Hefei. This expansion signals continued investment and growth in a key market, which is likely to positively impact investor sentiment. Moreover, the store opening coincides with the Chinese New Year, suggesting promotional activities that could boost sales. These factors align with previous predictions indicating a positive outlook due to expansion and seasonal events. However, the magnitude of impact is expected to be moderate, considering it is a single store opening.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant moves that major companies, including Apple, are making into AI, which is a driving force in the market. The emphasis on AI's growth potential and the stability of established companies like Apple suggests a positive outlook for its stock price. Additionally, the article encourages investors to consider AI-driven stocks, which may lead to increased buying interest in Apple. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news of Apple opening its first store in Anhui, China, is a positive indicator of growth and investment in a key market. The timing of the opening around Chinese New Year, coupled with special edition products and workshops, is likely to attract customers and boost sales. The store's design and features, such as the Genius Bar and Apple Pickup, enhance the customer experience. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is a general consensus that this news is slightly positive. Therefore, I will adjust the probability of stock price rising to be slightly higher than the average of the previous rounds' predictions, while also considering the fact that it is just one store opening and the impact will be limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) is a major negative factor, exacerbated by increasing competition and potential government subsidies favoring local brands.  The uncertainty surrounding a new credit card partner also adds to the negative sentiment.  While Apple maintains its position as the world's most valuable company and boasts a loyal customer base, the lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence, coupled with potential future tariffs, casts doubt on its near-term growth prospects.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation.  However, the significant negative news regarding China sales and credit card uncertainty outweighs the positive aspects of Apple's overall market position in the short term.  Considering the immediate impact of these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a rise.  The long-term prospects remain strong due to Apple's overall market position and brand loyalty, but the short-term outlook is clouded by the negative news.  My prediction leans towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but acknowledges the potential for resilience and recovery in the long term.  The probabilities reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, which could have mixed implications for Apple Inc.

The emphasis on AI's growth potential and the stability of established companies like Apple suggests a positive outlook for its stock price. Additionally, the article encourages investors to consider AI-driven stocks, which may lead to increased buying interest in Apple. While there are some mixed signals regarding sales in China and competition, the overall sentiment around AI investments and Apple's established market position supports a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The news of Apple opening a new store in Hefei, China, is a moderately positive signal. It indicates continued investment in a key market and leverages the Chinese New Year season. The store features and offerings are designed to enhance customer experience and drive sales. While a single store opening won't drastically impact the stock price, it contributes to positive momentum. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, the sentiment is generally positive, but not overwhelmingly so. I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect this, leaning slightly towards a rise, but acknowledging the limited impact of a single store.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  A significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) is a major negative factor, amplified by growing competition and potential government subsidies favoring domestic brands.
