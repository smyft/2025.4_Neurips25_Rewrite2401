(AAPL)\nNews Headline: China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips\nNews Content: Hi everyone! This is Lauly from Taipei. I hope 2025 has been kind to you so far.I am writing this week\u2019s newsletter having just finished\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this Financial Times article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription? Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant moves that major companies, including Apple, are making into AI, which is currently a driving force in the market. The emphasis on AI's growth potential and the stability of established companies like Apple suggests a positive outlook for its stock price. Additionally, the article encourages investors to consider AI-driven stocks, which may lead to increased buying interest in Apple. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is expanding its retail presence in China, specifically opening its first store in Anhui province. This expansion suggests continued growth and investment in a key market. The store opening is timed around Chinese New Year, a period of high consumer spending, and includes special edition products and workshops tailored to the holiday. The news also highlights Apple's latest products, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Vision Pro, which could drive sales. While a single store opening is unlikely to cause a massive surge in stock price, it signals positive momentum and commitment to the Chinese market. Therefore, the probability of a slight rise is higher than a fall. However, the impact is likely to be small, so the probability is not overwhelmingly high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the significant drop in iPhone sales in China and the potential credit card partner transition are negative factors, Apple's overall market dominance, strong brand loyalty, and massive market capitalization suggest resilience. The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro headset and Apple Intelligence is concerning, but not necessarily a death knell.  The potential for further tariffs adds uncertainty.  Weighing these factors, the negative news is substantial enough to suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong given Apple's overall market position.  The probability estimates reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, indicating potential developments in the semiconductor industry that could impact Apple's supply chain or component costs. However, without more detailed content, it's challenging to assess the direct impact on Apple. Given Apple's significant reliance on components, any breakthroughs in China could potentially reduce costs or improve supply chain stability, which might be viewed positively. On the other hand, the mention of Apple's first US chips could imply a strategic shift towards domestic production, which might be seen as a positive move for resilience but could also involve higher costs initially. The overall impact is uncertain, but leaning slightly positive due to potential supply chain improvements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its plans to increase capital expenditure has positively impacted the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, especially for iPhone chips, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a stable or potentially increased demand for Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price may be moderate since the news is primarily about TSMC's performance and outlook. The overall sentiment suggests a positive impact on tech stocks due to sustained AI spending, but Apple's stock movement may also be influenced by its own product cycle and market conditions. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but the movement is likely to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok's operations and user base, rather than Apple's financials. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The opening of a new retail store in a strategic location in China signals Apple's continued investment and expansion in one of its key markets. This expansion typically leads to increased brand presence and potentially higher sales. Additionally, the timing around Chinese New Year adds a festive promotion element which could attract more customers. These factors generally have a positive impact on investor sentiment and could contribute to a potential stock price increase.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
