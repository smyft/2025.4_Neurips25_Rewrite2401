(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs? The Era of Finance CEOs Running Retailers Is Over Why AI Investors Should Worry About the Self-Driving Car Crash\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant moves that major companies, including Apple, are making into AI, which is currently a driving force in the market. The emphasis on AI's growth potential and the stability of established companies like Apple suggests a positive outlook for its stock price. Additionally, the article encourages investors to consider AI-driven stocks, which may lead to increased buying interest in Apple. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is expanding its retail presence in China, specifically opening its first store in Anhui province. This expansion suggests continued growth and investment in a key market. The store opening is timed around Chinese New Year, a period of high consumer spending, and includes special edition products and workshops tailored to the holiday. The news also highlights Apple's latest products, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Vision Pro, which could drive sales. While a single store opening is unlikely to cause a massive surge in stock price, it signals positive momentum and commitment to the Chinese market. Therefore, the probability of a slight rise is higher than a fall. However, the impact is likely to be small, so the probability is not overwhelmingly high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the significant drop in iPhone sales in China and the potential credit card partner transition are negative factors, Apple's overall market dominance, strong brand loyalty, and massive market capitalization suggest resilience. The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro headset and Apple Intelligence is concerning, but not necessarily a death knell.  The potential for further tariffs adds uncertainty.  Weighing these factors, the negative news is substantial enough to suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong given Apple's overall market position.  The probability estimates reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, indicating potential developments in the semiconductor industry that could impact Apple's supply chain or component costs. However, without more detailed content, it's challenging to assess the direct impact on Apple. Given Apple's significant reliance on components, any breakthroughs in China could potentially reduce costs or improve supply chain stability, which might be viewed positively. On the other hand, the mention of Apple's first US chips could imply a strategic shift towards domestic production, which might be seen as a positive move for resilience but could also involve higher costs initially. The overall impact is uncertain, but leaning slightly positive due to potential supply chain improvements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its plans to increase capital expenditure has positively impacted the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, especially for iPhone chips, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a stable or potentially increased demand for Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price may be moderate since the news is primarily about TSMC's performance and outlook. The overall sentiment suggests a positive impact on tech stocks due to sustained AI spending, but Apple's stock movement may also be influenced by its own product cycle and market conditions. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but the movement is likely to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok's operations and user base, rather than Apple's financials. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The opening of a new retail store in a strategic location in China signals Apple's continued investment and expansion in one of its key markets. This expansion typically leads to increased brand presence and potentially higher sales. Additionally, the timing around Chinese New Year adds a festive promotion element which could attract more customers. These factors generally have a positive impact on investor sentiment and could contribute to a potential stock price increase.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
