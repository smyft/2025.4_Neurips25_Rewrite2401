(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't\nNews Content: By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant moves that major companies, including Apple, are making into AI, which is currently a driving force in the market. The emphasis on AI's growth potential and the stability of established companies like Apple suggests a positive outlook for its stock price. Additionally, the article encourages investors to consider AI-driven stocks, which may lead to increased buying interest in Apple. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is expanding its retail presence in China, specifically opening its first store in Anhui province. This expansion suggests continued growth and investment in a key market. The store opening is timed around Chinese New Year, a period of high consumer spending, and includes special edition products and workshops tailored to the holiday. The news also highlights Apple's latest products, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Vision Pro, which could drive sales. While a single store opening is unlikely to cause a massive surge in stock price, it signals positive momentum and commitment to the Chinese market. Therefore, the probability of a slight rise is higher than a fall. However, the impact is likely to be small, so the probability is not overwhelmingly high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While the significant drop in iPhone sales in China and the potential credit card partner transition are negative factors, Apple's overall market dominance, strong brand loyalty, and massive market capitalization suggest resilience. The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro headset and Apple Intelligence is concerning, but not necessarily a death knell.  The potential for further tariffs adds uncertainty.  Weighing these factors, the negative news is substantial enough to suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong given Apple's overall market position.  The probability estimates reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, indicating potential developments in the semiconductor industry that could impact Apple's supply chain or component costs. However, without more detailed content, it's challenging to assess the direct impact on Apple. Given Apple's significant reliance on components, any breakthroughs in China could potentially reduce costs or improve supply chain stability, which might be viewed positively. On the other hand, the mention of Apple's first US chips could imply a strategic shift towards domestic production, which might be seen as a positive move for resilience but could also involve higher costs initially. The overall impact is uncertain, but leaning slightly positive due to potential supply chain improvements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its plans to increase capital expenditure has positively impacted the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, especially for iPhone chips, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a stable or potentially increased demand for Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price may be moderate since the news is primarily about TSMC's performance and outlook. The overall sentiment suggests a positive impact on tech stocks due to sustained AI spending, but Apple's stock movement may also be influenced by its own product cycle and market conditions. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but the movement is likely to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok's operations and user base, rather than Apple's financials. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The opening of a new retail store in a strategic location in China signals Apple's continued investment and expansion in one of its key markets. This expansion typically leads to increased brand presence and potentially higher sales. Additionally, the timing around Chinese New Year adds a festive promotion element which could attract more customers. These factors generally have a positive impact on investor sentiment and could contribute to a potential stock price increase.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
