(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Apple's credit card partnership transition adds to investor concerns. Analysts predict a potential 10% drop in 2025 iPhone shipments, and external factors like tariffs could further complicate the situation. While Apple remains a dominant player with a strong market cap, the combination of declining sales, competitive pressures, and strategic uncertainties suggests a higher likelihood of stock price decline than increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's involvement in AI development, specifically 'Apple Intelligence,' which is presented as a positive factor for the company's growth. While the article doesn't solely focus on Apple, its inclusion among the top companies leveraging AI suggests a positive outlook. However, the article also emphasizes diversification and cautions against over-investing in AI stocks, which could temper enthusiasm. The 'Double Down' advertisement within the article, referencing past successes with other tech stocks, further reinforces a potentially positive sentiment. Given Apple's existing market position and the general positive sentiment surrounding AI, a rise in stock price is more likely than a fall, but the cautionary notes and the article's broader focus on AI trends rather than specific Apple news limit the potential magnitude of the rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is exploring a new credit card partnership with Barclays, potentially replacing Goldman Sachs.  While the full details are unavailable due to the paywalled nature of the article, a change in credit card partners could have several implications.  A positive outcome would be if Barclays offers Apple more favorable terms, leading to increased revenue or reduced costs for Apple's financial services. This could boost investor confidence and drive the stock price up. However, a negative outcome could involve less favorable terms, a more complex integration process, or potential disruptions to Apple Card services. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a stock price decline.  Given the lack of specifics, it's difficult to definitively assess the impact.  The probability of a price rise is assigned a slightly higher value due to the potential for improved financial terms for Apple, but the uncertainty warrants a significant probability of no change or even a slight decline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is generic and does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Apple has been rumored to be developing AR/VR technologies that could be linked to the Metaverse. If investors interpret this news as a positive signal for Apple's potential entry or expansion in the Metaverse space, it could lead to a rise in stock price. Conversely, if the news is seen as irrelevant or if Apple's involvement is doubted, the stock price may remain unaffected or even fall slightly due to lack of concrete information. Given the ambiguity, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive reaction due to Apple's history of innovation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in China, including a 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO, and potential difficulties in finding a new credit card partner. These factors, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Trump's potential tariffs and weak traction for its new products like the Vision Pro headset, suggest a negative short-term outlook for Apple's stock price. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, vast ecosystem, and historical resilience to competitive pressures could mitigate some of these risks. The market is likely to react negatively to these developments in the short term, given the concerns about Apple's growth prospects in a critical market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple opening a new store in China is a positive development for the company, indicating its continued expansion and investment in the region. This move is likely to increase Apple's brand presence and customer engagement in China, potentially leading to higher sales and revenue. The opening of a new store also suggests that Apple is confident in its growth prospects and is willing to invest in new markets. However, the impact of this news on the stock price may be limited, as it is a relatively small development in the grand scheme of Apple's global operations. Nevertheless, the positive sentiment and potential for increased sales and revenue make it more likely that the stock price will rise than fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights TSMC's strong performance and upbeat outlook, particularly in relation to AI spending. Given that TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple Inc., this positive outlook suggests continued demand for semiconductors used in Apple's products, potentially bolstering Apple's revenue and profitability. However, uncertainties related to geopolitical tensions and potential disruptions in supply chains could pose risks. Overall, the positive outlook outweighs the negatives, leading to a higher likelihood of stock price rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, particularly in the Chinese market where iPhone sales have plummeted by 25% year-over-year, and competition from local brands like Huawei is intensifying. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Apple's credit card partnership transition adds to investor concerns. Analysts predict a potential 10% drop in 2025 iPhone shipments, and external factors like tariffs could further complicate the situation. While Apple remains a dominant player with a strong market cap, the combination of declining sales, competitive pressures, and strategic uncertainties suggests a higher likelihood of stock price decline than increase. Therefore, the probabilities lean towards a fall in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's involvement in AI, specifically 'Apple Intelligence,' and its position among the top companies leveraging AI. This is generally a positive signal for investors. The article also mentions the broader AI trend and its potential for significant growth. The 'Double Down' advertisement, referencing past successes with tech stocks like Apple itself, further reinforces a potentially positive sentiment. Considering these factors and the previous round predictions, I believe the stock price is more likely to rise than fall. However, the cautionary notes about diversification and the article's broader focus on AI trends temper the potential magnitude of the rise. The previous round predictions show a general positive sentiment towards Apple's stock price, which further supports the prediction of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple exploring a new credit card partnership with Barclays is ambiguous.  While a switch could lead to improved terms and increased revenue (positive), it could also result in disruptions or less favorable terms (negative). The lack of specifics makes it difficult to definitively assess the impact.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some highlighting positive factors like AI development and others emphasizing negative factors like declining sales in China.  Considering the uncertainty inherent in the credit card partnership change and the conflicting signals from previous predictions, I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability to both price rise and fall.  The weight given to the news itself is relatively low compared to the overall market sentiment and other factors affecting Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, indicating significant uncertainty in the market about Apple's future performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is generic and does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Apple has been rumored to be developing AR/VR technologies that could be linked to the Metaverse. Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds, where some models highlighted positive factors like AI development and new store openings, while others pointed to challenges in China and competitive pressures, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is ambiguous. The lack of concrete information about Apple's direct involvement in the Metaverse suggests a neutral to slightly positive reaction. Therefore, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive reaction due to Apple's history of innovation and potential market expansion.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc. in China, including a 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO. Additionally, Apple is facing uncertainty with its credit card partnership transition. While Apple's ecosystem and brand loyalty are strong, the combination of declining sales, competitive pressures, and strategic uncertainties suggests a higher likelihood of stock price decline than increase. However, some models consider Apple's potential in AI and its historical resilience, which could mitigate some risks. Weighing these factors, the probabilities lean towards a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple opening a new store in China, Apple MixC Hefei, is a positive development for the company, indicating its continued expansion and investment in the region. This move is likely to increase Apple's brand presence and customer engagement in China, potentially leading to higher sales and revenue. The opening of a new store also suggests that Apple is confident in its growth prospects and is willing to invest in new markets. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of positive and negative sentiments. However, the positive sentiment and potential for increased sales and revenue make it more likely that the stock price will rise than fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights TSMC's strong performance and upbeat outlook, particularly in relation to AI spending. Given that TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple Inc., this positive outlook suggests continued demand for semiconductors used in Apple's products, potentially bolstering Apple's revenue and profitability. The article mentions that TSMC projects spending on AI hardware to remain resilient in 2025. However, uncertainties related to geopolitical tensions and potential disruptions in supply chains could pose risks. Despite these risks, the positive outlook from TSMC is likely to have a more substantial positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, particularly in the Chinese market where iPhone sales have plummeted by 25% year-over-year, and competition from local brands like Huawei is intensifying. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Apple's credit card partnership transition adds to investor concerns. Analysts predict a potential 10% drop in 2025 iPhone shipments, and external factors like tariffs could further complicate the situation.

Considering the previous rounds, there's a mix of opinions, but the emphasis on AI and Apple's involvement suggests a positive outlook. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple potentially switching its credit card partner from Goldman Sachs to Barclays is ambiguous and doesn't provide enough information to definitively predict stock price movement.  The outcome depends entirely on the terms of the new partnership.  Better terms could boost Apple's financial services revenue, leading to a price rise. Conversely, worse terms or disruptions could negatively impact investor sentiment and cause a price fall.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding this news. Some models focus on positive aspects like Apple's AI initiatives or TSMC's positive outlook, while others highlight negative factors such as declining sales in China and competitive pressures.  Given the lack of concrete information about the Barclays partnership and the conflicting signals from previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both price rise and fall, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the potential for improved financial terms. The overall market sentiment and other factors affecting Apple's stock price will likely play a more significant role than this specific news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is generic and does not specifically mention Apple Inc.
