However, Apple has been rumored to be developing AR/VR technologies that could be linked to the Metaverse. If investors interpret this news as a positive signal for Apple's potential entry or expansion in the Metaverse space, it could lead to a rise in stock price. Conversely, if the news is seen as irrelevant or if Apple's involvement is doubted, the stock price may remain unaffected or even fall slightly due to lack of concrete information.
