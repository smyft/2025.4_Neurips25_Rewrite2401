(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's China Nightmare: iPhone Sales Plummet as Huawei Surges -- Is the Empire Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

(AAPL) in China, including a 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO, and potential difficulties in finding a new credit card partner. These factors, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Trump's potential tariffs and weak traction for its new products like the Vision Pro headset, suggest a negative short-term outlook for Apple's stock price. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, vast ecosystem, and historical resilience to competitive pressures could mitigate some of these risks.
