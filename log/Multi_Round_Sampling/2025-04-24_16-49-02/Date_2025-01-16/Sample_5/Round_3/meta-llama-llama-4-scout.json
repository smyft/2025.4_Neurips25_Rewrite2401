(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024\nNews Content: Mainland China's smartphone market shipped 285 million units in 2024, achieving 4% annual growth following two years of decline, Canalys reported Thursday. Rising demand across all sectors drove the recovery; suppliers used smart investments and technology improvements.\n\nComprising 17% of all shipments, vivo dominated the market with 49.3 million devices delivered. With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025. To attract customers across price points, vendors are anticipated to concentrate on increased product features including better battery life, creative form factors, and AI-powered systems.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a significant drop in shipments compared to previous years. This decline in performance, especially in a key market like China, could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a decrease in stock price. The competition from Huawei and vivo, which are gaining ground, further exacerbates the situation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While Apple regained the top spot in China's smartphone market in Q4, the overall trend is concerning. Apple's shipments in China plummeted 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year, falling behind Vivo and Huawei in the overall 2024 market share. This indicates increasing competition and potential loss of market share in a crucial market. The rise of Huawei, fueled by patriotic sentiment and domestic chip advancements, poses a significant threat. Apple's attempts to counter this with discounts and improved retail experiences might not be enough to offset the negative impact. The overall market growth in China is a positive sign, but Apple's underperformance relative to its competitors suggests a potential negative impact on its stock price. Given the negative trends outweigh the positive, a stock price fall is more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's decline in market share in the Chinese smartphone market is a significant negative factor.  While they regained the top spot in Q4 2024, their overall yearly performance shows a substantial drop (17% year-over-year) and a loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo. This suggests weakening market position in a key region.  The aggressive price cuts implemented by Apple to stimulate sales further highlight the competitive pressure they face.  The resurgence of Huawei, fueled by new domestically produced chips, poses a serious long-term threat.  While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's struggles within that market are concerning.  The positive Q4 performance might offer some short-term support, but the overall trend is negative.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, although the impact might be mitigated by other factors not mentioned in this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline mentions 'China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips,' which suggests potential technological advancements and supply chain developments. However, the full content of the article is behind a paywall, limiting the ability to fully assess the impact. Given Apple's reliance on global supply chains, especially in China, a memory breakthrough could either positively or negatively affect costs and production efficiency. The mention of 'first US chips' might indicate a shift toward domestic production, which could be viewed positively by investors. Due to the lack of detailed information, the probabilities are estimated with moderate uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is losing ground in Mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, representing a 17% drop from 2023, placing them third in the market. In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 13.1 million devices, a 25% drop from the same period in 2023. This decline in market share and sales in a significant market like Mainland China is likely to be viewed negatively by investors, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This trend suggests a strategic move towards technological advancement and innovation, which can lead to increased competitiveness and potential revenue growth for these companies. Given Apple's involvement in this AI push, it is likely that investors will view this as a positive development, anticipating future benefits from AI integration into Apple's products and services. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling due to the perceived positive impact of AI investments on the company's future prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is quite broad and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.'s involvement or plans regarding the Metaverse. Without concrete information about how Apple is positioning itself in the Metaverse space, it's difficult to assess the direct impact on its stock price. However, since Apple is a major technology player and any significant developments in emerging technologies like the Metaverse could be seen positively by investors, there might be a slight positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost significant market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments year-over-year and a 25% decline in Q4 compared to the previous year. This decline is exacerbated by the rise of competitors like Huawei and vivo, which are gaining ground in a crucial market. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's performance relative to its competitors is concerning. The previous predictions from various models reflect a consensus that the negative trends outweigh any potential positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall. Therefore, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a concerning trend for Apple in China, its second-most important market. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4, the overall yearly performance shows a significant drop in shipments and market share, falling behind Vivo and Huawei. The resurgence of Huawei, fueled by domestic chips and patriotic sentiment, poses a serious threat. Apple's attempts to counter this with discounts suggest competitive pressure. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that this news is negative for Apple. The initial predictions leaned heavily towards a stock price fall, while later predictions were more mixed, possibly influenced by other factors or information. Given the continued negative trend in China and the competitive pressures, I believe the probability of a stock price fall remains higher than a rise, but slightly less extreme than the initial predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While regaining the top spot in Q4 in China is positive, the overall yearly decline in shipments (17%) and loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo are significant negatives.  The aggressive price cuts to boost sales highlight competitive pressure. Huawei's resurgence, driven by domestic chip production and patriotic sentiment, poses a substantial threat.  Although the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance is concerning.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some emphasizing the negative aspects (market share loss, price cuts) and others focusing on potential mitigating factors (Q4 recovery, Apple's overall strength).  Considering the significant negative trends outweighing the positive Q4 performance, and the lack of information on how Apple's AI initiatives will impact the situation, a price fall is more likely. However, Apple's overall brand strength and diversification beyond smartphones should mitigate the impact. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but not as high as some previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips' suggests potential technological advancements and supply chain developments for Apple. However, the full content is behind a paywall, limiting detailed analysis. Previous predictions from other models indicate mixed sentiments, with some highlighting Apple's declining market share in China as a negative factor, while others point to potential positive impacts from technological advancements and AI investments. Given the uncertainty and mixed signals, the probabilities are estimated with moderate confidence, leaning slightly towards a positive impact due to the potential benefits of technological breakthroughs and domestic chip production.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc.

Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is vague and does not provide specific details about Apple's involvement or plans related to the Metaverse. Previous predictions suggest that Apple is facing challenges in the Chinese smartphone market, with declining market share and sales. However, the news about investments in the Metaverse could potentially be viewed positively by investors if it indicates a strategic move towards technological advancement and innovation. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's Metaverse activities, the overall prediction leans slightly more towards the negative sentiments provided by previous rounds.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost significant market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments year-over-year and a 25% decline in Q4 compared to the previous year.

Therefore, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates a concerning trend for Apple in China, a crucial market. While Q4 showed a temporary rebound, the overall yearly performance reveals a significant decline in shipments and market share, with Huawei and Vivo surpassing Apple. The resurgence of Huawei, fueled by domestic chips and patriotic sentiment, poses a substantial threat. Apple's price cuts highlight the competitive pressure. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that this news is negative for Apple. The initial predictions leaned heavily towards a stock price fall, while later predictions were more mixed. Given the continued negative trend in China and the competitive pressures, I believe the probability of a stock price fall remains higher than a rise. The AI investments mentioned in some previous rounds are not directly related to this news and should not be considered. Therefore, I will stick to the negative sentiment indicated by the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While regaining the top spot in China's Q4 smartphone market is positive, the overall yearly decline in shipments (17%) and loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo are significant negatives.  Huawei's resurgence, fueled by domestic chip production and patriotic sentiment, poses a substantial threat. Apple's price cuts to boost sales highlight competitive pressure.  The overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, but Apple's underperformance is concerning. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting the mixed signals.  The negative trends (market share loss, price cuts, Huawei's rise) outweigh the positive Q4 performance. However, Apple's overall brand strength, diversification beyond smartphones, and potential future benefits from AI investments could mitigate the negative impact. Considering all factors, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely than a significant rise, but the impact is likely to be moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips' hints at potential technological advancements and supply chain improvements for Apple, which could be viewed positively by investors. However, the full content is behind a paywall, limiting a comprehensive analysis. Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments. Some models highlight Apple's declining market share in China as a negative factor, while others emphasize the potential positive impact of technological advancements and AI investments. Given the uncertainty and the fact that the negative trends in China's market (e.g., 17% drop in shipments, loss of market share to Huawei and vivo) are more concrete and impactful in the short term, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher. However, the potential long-term benefits of technological breakthroughs and domestic chip production provide some upside, leading to a moderate probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost significant ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments year-over-year and a 25% decline in Q4 compared to the previous year.
