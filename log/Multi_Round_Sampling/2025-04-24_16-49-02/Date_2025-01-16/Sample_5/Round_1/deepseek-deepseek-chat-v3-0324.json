(AAPL)\nNews Headline: China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips\nNews Content: Hi everyone! This is Lauly from Taipei. I hope 2025 has been kind to you so far.I am writing this week\u2019s newsletter having just finished\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this Financial Times article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription? Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a significant drop in shipments compared to previous years. This decline in performance, especially in a key market like China, could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a decrease in stock price. The competition from Huawei and vivo, which are gaining ground, further exacerbates the situation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While Apple regained the top spot in China's smartphone market in Q4, the overall trend is concerning. Apple's shipments in China plummeted 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year, falling behind Vivo and Huawei in the overall 2024 market share. This indicates increasing competition and potential loss of market share in a crucial market. The rise of Huawei, fueled by patriotic sentiment and domestic chip advancements, poses a significant threat. Apple's attempts to counter this with discounts and improved retail experiences might not be enough to offset the negative impact. The overall market growth in China is a positive sign, but Apple's underperformance relative to its competitors suggests a potential negative impact on its stock price. Given the negative trends outweigh the positive, a stock price fall is more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's decline in market share in the Chinese smartphone market is a significant negative factor.  While they regained the top spot in Q4 2024, their overall yearly performance shows a substantial drop (17% year-over-year) and a loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo. This suggests weakening market position in a key region.  The aggressive price cuts implemented by Apple to stimulate sales further highlight the competitive pressure they face.  The resurgence of Huawei, fueled by new domestically produced chips, poses a serious long-term threat.  While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's struggles within that market are concerning.  The positive Q4 performance might offer some short-term support, but the overall trend is negative.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, although the impact might be mitigated by other factors not mentioned in this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline mentions 'China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips,' which suggests potential technological advancements and supply chain developments. However, the full content of the article is behind a paywall, limiting the ability to fully assess the impact. Given Apple's reliance on global supply chains, especially in China, a memory breakthrough could either positively or negatively affect costs and production efficiency. The mention of 'first US chips' might indicate a shift toward domestic production, which could be viewed positively by investors. Due to the lack of detailed information, the probabilities are estimated with moderate uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is losing ground in Mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, representing a 17% drop from 2023, placing them third in the market. In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 13.1 million devices, a 25% drop from the same period in 2023. This decline in market share and sales in a significant market like Mainland China is likely to be viewed negatively by investors, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This trend suggests a strategic move towards technological advancement and innovation, which can lead to increased competitiveness and potential revenue growth for these companies. Given Apple's involvement in this AI push, it is likely that investors will view this as a positive development, anticipating future benefits from AI integration into Apple's products and services. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling due to the perceived positive impact of AI investments on the company's future prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Metaverse Stocks' is quite broad and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.'s involvement or plans regarding the Metaverse. Without concrete information about how Apple is positioning itself in the Metaverse space, it's difficult to assess the direct impact on its stock price. However, since Apple is a major technology player and any significant developments in emerging technologies like the Metaverse could be seen positively by investors, there might be a slight positive sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
