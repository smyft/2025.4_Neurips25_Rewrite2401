A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which may positively influence investor sentiment towards technology companies, including Apple Inc. However, the news does not directly mention Apple, and the focus is on Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Therefore, while there may be a slight positive impact on AAPL due to the general interest in AI, the lack of direct relevance to Apple leads to a more cautious outlook. The probabilities reflect a moderate chance of price increase due to overall market sentiment towards AI, but also a notable chance of price stability or decline due to the lack of direct news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple (AAPL). TSMC's upbeat outlook, driven by strong AI spending, suggests continued demand for high-end chips, which Apple uses in its iPhones and other devices. TSMC's projected revenue growth and capital expenditure plans indicate confidence in future demand. While smartphone growth is expected to be low, the potential for mobile AI features to drive the broader market is a positive factor. However, muted iPhone sales and geopolitical risks (US-China tech conflict) introduce some uncertainty. The fact that TSMC is Apple's largest customer means that TSMC's success is closely tied to Apple's. Considering these factors, the positive aspects outweigh the negative, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China, is a positive development, but its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook has historically had a good relationship with Donald Trump and is attending his inauguration, along with other tech leaders. This indicates a potential for favorable policies or reduced regulatory pressures under the new administration, which could benefit Apple. The attendance and contributions to Trump's inauguration by tech leaders suggest a strategic move to align with the incoming administration, likely to foster business-friendly policies. Given Apple's substantial market presence and the importance of government relations, this alignment could be viewed positively by investors, leading to a potential rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world are making big moves into AI, and investors should pay attention. While the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and a leader in technology. It is likely that Apple is one of the companies making moves into AI, which could be seen as a positive development for the company. However, the news does not provide specific information about Apple's AI plans, so the impact on the stock price is uncertain. Given the general positive sentiment around AI investments, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses TSMC's upbeat outlook, which is likely to have a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple. The article mentions that TSMC's strong performance has buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle, which could drive growth for Apple. Additionally, TSMC's projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure are ahead of analysts' estimates, indicating a positive trend. However, the article also mentions uncertainties stemming from the US-China tech conflict, which could potentially disrupt supply chains and impact Apple's sales. Overall, the positive outlook from TSMC and the potential for growth in AI spending are likely to outweigh the negative factors, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's potential partnership with Barclays and Synchrony for its credit card could be seen as a positive development for the company. This new partnership might bring changes or improvements to their current credit card offerings, which could enhance customer satisfaction and revenue streams. However, replacing an existing partner like Goldman Sachs could also introduce uncertainties or challenges during the transition period. Overall, the news seems more likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
