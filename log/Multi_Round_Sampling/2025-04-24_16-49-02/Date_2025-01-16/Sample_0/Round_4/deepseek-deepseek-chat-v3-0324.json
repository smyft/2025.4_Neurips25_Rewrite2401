(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which may positively influence investor sentiment towards technology companies, including Apple Inc. However, the news does not directly mention Apple, and the focus is on Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Therefore, while there may be a slight positive impact on AAPL due to the general interest in AI, the lack of direct relevance to Apple leads to a more cautious outlook. The probabilities reflect a moderate chance of price increase due to overall market sentiment towards AI, but also a notable chance of price stability or decline due to the lack of direct news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple (AAPL). TSMC's upbeat outlook, driven by strong AI spending, suggests continued demand for high-end chips, which Apple uses in its iPhones and other devices. TSMC's projected revenue growth and capital expenditure plans indicate confidence in future demand. While smartphone growth is expected to be low, the potential for mobile AI features to drive the broader market is a positive factor. However, muted iPhone sales and geopolitical risks (US-China tech conflict) introduce some uncertainty. The fact that TSMC is Apple's largest customer means that TSMC's success is closely tied to Apple's. Considering these factors, the positive aspects outweigh the negative, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China, is a positive development, but its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook has historically had a good relationship with Donald Trump and is attending his inauguration, along with other tech leaders. This indicates a potential for favorable policies or reduced regulatory pressures under the new administration, which could benefit Apple. The attendance and contributions to Trump's inauguration by tech leaders suggest a strategic move to align with the incoming administration, likely to foster business-friendly policies. Given Apple's substantial market presence and the importance of government relations, this alignment could be viewed positively by investors, leading to a potential rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world are making big moves into AI, and investors should pay attention. While the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and a leader in technology. It is likely that Apple is one of the companies making moves into AI, which could be seen as a positive development for the company. However, the news does not provide specific information about Apple's AI plans, so the impact on the stock price is uncertain. Given the general positive sentiment around AI investments, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses TSMC's upbeat outlook, which is likely to have a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple. The article mentions that TSMC's strong performance has buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle, which could drive growth for Apple. Additionally, TSMC's projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure are ahead of analysts' estimates, indicating a positive trend. However, the article also mentions uncertainties stemming from the US-China tech conflict, which could potentially disrupt supply chains and impact Apple's sales. Overall, the positive outlook from TSMC and the potential for growth in AI spending are likely to outweigh the negative factors, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's potential partnership with Barclays and Synchrony for its credit card could be seen as a positive development for the company. This new partnership might bring changes or improvements to their current credit card offerings, which could enhance customer satisfaction and revenue streams. However, replacing an existing partner like Goldman Sachs could also introduce uncertainties or challenges during the transition period. Overall, the news seems more likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which may create a positive sentiment towards technology companies, including Apple Inc. However, the news does not directly mention Apple, leading to a cautious outlook. The previous predictions indicate a range of probabilities, with some analysts seeing a moderate positive impact due to the general interest in AI and TSMC's strong outlook, which is closely tied to Apple's performance. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, reflecting the overall positive sentiment towards AI investments, but also acknowledge the uncertainty due to the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple. TSMC's strong outlook, driven by AI spending, directly benefits Apple as TSMC is its primary chip supplier. TSMC's increased capital expenditure and revenue projections signal strong demand for the chips Apple uses. While concerns exist regarding muted iPhone sales and geopolitical tensions, the overall sentiment is bullish due to the AI-driven growth. The previous rounds of predictions show a generally positive sentiment towards Apple based on similar news, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. Considering the consistent positive outlook and the direct link between TSMC's success and Apple's performance, I am assigning a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China is a positive but relatively minor event for Apple. While it demonstrates continued expansion in a key market and potentially increased revenue, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance is likely to be small.  The news is unlikely to significantly shift investor sentiment on its own.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the generally positive but limited impact of this news, a probability of a price rise slightly above 0.5 is reasonable. The probability of a price fall is correspondingly low, reflecting the generally positive nature of the news, albeit a small one.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the tech industry's alignment with the incoming Trump administration, with Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration and contributing to Trump's campaign. This suggests potential for favorable policies or reduced regulatory pressures, which could benefit Apple. However, the broader context includes past tensions between Trump and tech leaders, introducing some uncertainty. Given Apple's strong market position and the strategic importance of government relations, the overall sentiment is likely positive, but not overwhelmingly so. Previous predictions also lean towards a moderate positive impact, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a stock price rise. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world are making big moves into AI, which could positively impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is one of the largest companies and a leader in technology. Although the news does not directly mention Apple, the general positive sentiment around AI investments could lead to a favorable outlook for the company. Several previous predictions indicate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising, with some models citing TSMC's upbeat outlook and potential for AI spending as positive factors. However, uncertainties such as geopolitical risks and muted iPhone sales are also considered. Taking these factors into account, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook and its impact on AI spending is likely to have a positive effect on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple. The strong performance and projected revenue growth of TSMC indicate a positive trend, which could drive growth for Apple. However, uncertainties stemming from the US-China tech conflict and muted iPhone sales introduce some risks. Considering the positive aspects outweigh the negative factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a potential credit card partnership, which could lead to enhancements in their credit card offerings and potentially improve customer engagement and revenue streams. Previous predictions from various models show a consistent trend of higher probabilities of stock price rises due to positive developments, with the most recent estimations ranging between 0.55 and 0.7. These predictions often cite positive sentiments around technological advancements and partnerships. Although this news does not directly address technological innovation, a new financial partnership is generally viewed positively as it can expand revenue sources and improve financial services for customers. However, there is a possibility of uncertainties during the transition phase if Goldman Sachs is replaced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which may create a positive sentiment towards technology companies, including Apple Inc.

TSMC's increased capital expenditure and revenue projections signal strong demand for the chips Apple uses. While there are concerns about muted iPhone sales and geopolitical tensions, the overall sentiment is bullish due to the AI-driven growth. The previous rounds of predictions show a generally positive sentiment towards Apple based on similar news, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Considering the consistent positive outlook and the direct link between TSMC's success and Apple's performance, I am assigning a higher probability of stock price increase, slightly adjusted upwards from the previous round due to the continued positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news of Apple opening a new store in Hefei, China is positive but relatively minor.  While it shows continued expansion in a key market, the impact on Apple's overall stock price is likely to be small.  The event is not a major catalyst for significant changes in investor sentiment or a substantial shift in the company's financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning slightly towards a price increase due to various other factors (AI investments, TSMC's outlook, etc.). However, this specific news is unlikely to significantly move the needle on its own.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is only slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, reflecting the generally positive but limited impact of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the tech industry's alignment with the incoming Trump administration, with Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration and contributing to Trump's campaign.

(AAPL) as it is one of the largest companies and a leader in technology. Although the news does not directly mention Apple, the general positive sentiment around AI investments could lead to a favorable outlook for the company.

TSMC's upbeat outlook, driven by strong AI spending, directly benefits Apple as TSMC is its primary chip supplier. TSMC's increased capital expenditure and revenue projections signal strong demand for the chips Apple uses. While there are concerns about muted iPhone sales and geopolitical tensions, the overall sentiment is bullish due to the AI-driven growth.

Considering the consistent positive outlook and the direct link between TSMC's success and Apple's performance, I am assigning a higher probability of stock price increase, slightly adjusted upwards from the previous round due to the continued positive sentiment and TSMC's specific mention of smartphone chips and AI PCs supporting revenue.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news of a new Apple store opening in Hefei, China is positive but relatively minor in the context of Apple's overall global operations.

The event itself is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or affect the company's overall financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a slight increase in stock price due to other factors like AI investments and TSMC's positive outlook. However, this specific news is unlikely to be a major driver of stock price movement. Therefore, I assign a probability slightly above 0.5 for a price rise, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but acknowledging the limited impact of this single event. The probability of a price fall is correspondingly low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the tech industry's alignment with the incoming Trump administration, with Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration and contributing to Trump's campaign.
