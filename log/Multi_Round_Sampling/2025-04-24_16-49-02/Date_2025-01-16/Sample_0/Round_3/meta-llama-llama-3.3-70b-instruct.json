(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which may positively influence investor sentiment towards technology companies, including Apple Inc. However, the news does not directly mention Apple, and the focus is on Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Therefore, while there may be a slight positive impact on AAPL due to the general interest in AI, the lack of direct relevance to Apple leads to a more cautious outlook. The probabilities reflect a moderate chance of price increase due to overall market sentiment towards AI, but also a notable chance of price stability or decline due to the lack of direct news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple (AAPL). TSMC's upbeat outlook, driven by strong AI spending, suggests continued demand for high-end chips, which Apple uses in its iPhones and other devices. TSMC's projected revenue growth and capital expenditure plans indicate confidence in future demand. While smartphone growth is expected to be low, the potential for mobile AI features to drive the broader market is a positive factor. However, muted iPhone sales and geopolitical risks (US-China tech conflict) introduce some uncertainty. The fact that TSMC is Apple's largest customer means that TSMC's success is closely tied to Apple's. Considering these factors, the positive aspects outweigh the negative, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China, is a positive development, but its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook has historically had a good relationship with Donald Trump and is attending his inauguration, along with other tech leaders. This indicates a potential for favorable policies or reduced regulatory pressures under the new administration, which could benefit Apple. The attendance and contributions to Trump's inauguration by tech leaders suggest a strategic move to align with the incoming administration, likely to foster business-friendly policies. Given Apple's substantial market presence and the importance of government relations, this alignment could be viewed positively by investors, leading to a potential rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world are making big moves into AI, and investors should pay attention. While the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and a leader in technology. It is likely that Apple is one of the companies making moves into AI, which could be seen as a positive development for the company. However, the news does not provide specific information about Apple's AI plans, so the impact on the stock price is uncertain. Given the general positive sentiment around AI investments, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses TSMC's upbeat outlook, which is likely to have a positive impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple. The article mentions that TSMC's strong performance has buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle, which could drive growth for Apple. Additionally, TSMC's projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure are ahead of analysts' estimates, indicating a positive trend. However, the article also mentions uncertainties stemming from the US-China tech conflict, which could potentially disrupt supply chains and impact Apple's sales. Overall, the positive outlook from TSMC and the potential for growth in AI spending are likely to outweigh the negative factors, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's potential partnership with Barclays and Synchrony for its credit card could be seen as a positive development for the company. This new partnership might bring changes or improvements to their current credit card offerings, which could enhance customer satisfaction and revenue streams. However, replacing an existing partner like Goldman Sachs could also introduce uncertainties or challenges during the transition period. Overall, the news seems more likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which may create a positive sentiment towards technology companies, including Apple Inc. However, the news does not directly mention Apple, leading to a cautious outlook. The previous predictions indicate a range of probabilities, with some analysts seeing a moderate positive impact due to the general interest in AI and TSMC's strong outlook, which is closely tied to Apple's performance. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, reflecting the overall positive sentiment towards AI investments, but also acknowledge the uncertainty due to the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple. TSMC's strong outlook, driven by AI spending, directly benefits Apple as TSMC is its primary chip supplier. TSMC's increased capital expenditure and revenue projections signal strong demand for the chips Apple uses. While concerns exist regarding muted iPhone sales and geopolitical tensions, the overall sentiment is bullish due to the AI-driven growth. The previous rounds of predictions show a generally positive sentiment towards Apple based on similar news, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. Considering the consistent positive outlook and the direct link between TSMC's success and Apple's performance, I am assigning a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China is a positive but relatively minor event for Apple. While it demonstrates continued expansion in a key market and potentially increased revenue, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance is likely to be small.  The news is unlikely to significantly shift investor sentiment on its own.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the generally positive but limited impact of this news, a probability of a price rise slightly above 0.5 is reasonable. The probability of a price fall is correspondingly low, reflecting the generally positive nature of the news, albeit a small one.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the tech industry's alignment with the incoming Trump administration, with Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration and contributing to Trump's campaign. This suggests potential for favorable policies or reduced regulatory pressures, which could benefit Apple. However, the broader context includes past tensions between Trump and tech leaders, introducing some uncertainty. Given Apple's strong market position and the strategic importance of government relations, the overall sentiment is likely positive, but not overwhelmingly so. Previous predictions also lean towards a moderate positive impact, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a stock price rise. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that 9 of the 10 largest companies in the world are making big moves into AI, which could positively impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is one of the largest companies and a leader in technology. Although the news does not directly mention Apple, the general positive sentiment around AI investments could lead to a favorable outlook for the company. Several previous predictions indicate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising, with some models citing TSMC's upbeat outlook and potential for AI spending as positive factors. However, uncertainties such as geopolitical risks and muted iPhone sales are also considered. Taking these factors into account, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook and its impact on AI spending is likely to have a positive effect on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple. The strong performance and projected revenue growth of TSMC indicate a positive trend, which could drive growth for Apple. However, uncertainties stemming from the US-China tech conflict and muted iPhone sales introduce some risks. Considering the positive aspects outweigh the negative factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a potential credit card partnership, which could lead to enhancements in their credit card offerings and potentially improve customer engagement and revenue streams. Previous predictions from various models show a consistent trend of higher probabilities of stock price rises due to positive developments, with the most recent estimations ranging between 0.55 and 0.7. These predictions often cite positive sentiments around technological advancements and partnerships. Although this news does not directly address technological innovation, a new financial partnership is generally viewed positively as it can expand revenue sources and improve financial services for customers. However, there is a possibility of uncertainties during the transition phase if Goldman Sachs is replaced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which may create a positive sentiment towards technology companies, including Apple Inc.

Considering the consistent positive outlook and the direct link between TSMC's success and Apple's performance, I am assigning a higher probability of stock price increase, slightly adjusted upwards from the previous round due to the continued positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news of Apple opening a new store in Hefei, China is positive but relatively minor.  While it shows continued expansion in a key market, the impact on Apple's overall stock price is likely to be small.  The event is not a major catalyst for significant changes in investor sentiment or a substantial shift in the company's financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning slightly towards a price increase due to various other factors (AI investments, TSMC's outlook, etc.). However, this specific news is unlikely to significantly move the needle on its own.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is only slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, reflecting the generally positive but limited impact of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the tech industry's alignment with the incoming Trump administration, with Apple CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration and contributing to Trump's campaign.
