(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, are aligning themselves with President-elect Trump, which may suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for tech companies. This could lead to positive sentiment in the market, as investors often react favorably to perceived stability and potential business-friendly policies. However, the historical tensions between Trump and some tech leaders, along with the mixed reactions to political donations, could introduce uncertainty. Overall, the alignment with Trump may be seen as a strategic move to mitigate risks and enhance opportunities, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is expanding its retail presence in China, specifically in a new province (Anhui). This expansion suggests continued growth and investment in a key market. The opening of a new store, especially one designed with sustainable materials and offering the latest products (iPhone 16, MacBook Pro with M4, Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Vision Pro), is generally a positive signal. The emphasis on personalized service, 'Today at Apple' sessions, and special Chinese New Year promotions further enhances the positive outlook. However, the impact of a single store opening on a company as large as Apple is likely to be marginal. Therefore, while the news is positive, it's unlikely to cause a significant surge in the stock price. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\" is very general and doesn't provide any specific information about Apple Inc.  Apple's involvement in the metaverse is not a major focus of the company's current strategy, and this headline doesn't suggest any new developments or initiatives related to Apple and the metaverse. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price change is assumed to be close to the baseline probability of a price change on any given day, which is influenced by many other factors not mentioned in this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline raises a concerning question about Apple's future, which could lead to investor uncertainty and negative sentiment. While the headline does not provide specific negative data, the mere suggestion of worry can influence market perception. Historically, such headlines can lead to short-term stock price declines due to emotional trading. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and market position may mitigate significant drops. The probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a negative reaction based on the headline's tone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership. This potential partnership could expand Apple's services segment, which has been a growing area for the company. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain as it depends on market expectations and the specifics of the partnership. Generally, new partnerships can be viewed positively if they are expected to increase revenue or enhance the company's offerings. Given that this news is about a potential expansion of Apple's services and not a negative event, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. However, without specific details on the terms or expected impact, the probabilities are not extremely skewed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok and its users, rather than Apple's financials. Apple's role in the situation is limited to removing the app from its store and ceasing updates, which is a regulatory compliance issue rather than a financial one. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests concern or doubt about the current state or future prospects of Apple Inc. Such headlines typically evoke negative sentiments among investors, leading to potential selling pressure on the stock. The question posed in the headline implies uncertainty, which can be seen as a red flag for many investors. While it's important to consider various factors like company fundamentals, market conditions, and broader economic trends, the headline alone points towards a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, are aligning themselves with President-elect Trump, which may suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for tech companies. This alignment could lead to positive sentiment in the market, as investors often react favorably to perceived stability and potential business-friendly policies. However, the historical tensions between Trump and some tech leaders, along with the mixed reactions to political donations, introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the strategic move to engage with the new administration may enhance opportunities for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news of Apple opening a new store in Hefei, China, is generally positive. It signifies continued expansion in a key market and demonstrates Apple's commitment to growth. The store features the latest products and services, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Vision Pro, and offers personalized experiences. This aligns with Apple's strategy of enhancing customer engagement and driving sales. However, the impact of a single store opening on a company as large as Apple is likely to be limited. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a positive impact and others being more neutral. Given the positive nature of the news and the overall trend of expansion, I'll slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise compared to the previous round's average. However, I'll also acknowledge the limited impact of a single store opening and the potential for other market factors to influence the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\" is too generic to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the lack of direct relevance of the headline to Apple's performance.  While some models linked the headline to other news (e.g., potential partnerships or political alignments), these connections are tenuous and not directly supported by the provided headline. The majority of previous predictions lean slightly towards a stock price rise, but with probabilities clustered around 0.5, indicating significant uncertainty.  Given the lack of specific information about Apple in the headline, I'm assigning probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting the neutral impact of this generic news item. The wide range of previous predictions further supports this conclusion, suggesting that the headline itself is not a strong driver of price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline raises a concerning question about Apple's future, which could lead to investor uncertainty and negative sentiment.

This potential partnership could expand Apple's services segment, which has been a growing area for the company. Generally, new partnerships can be viewed positively if they are expected to increase revenue or enhance the company's offerings. However, without specific details on the terms or expected impact, the probabilities are not extremely skewed. The partnership could lead to increased revenue and enhance Apple's offerings, but the actual impact will depend on the specifics of the agreement and market expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok and its users, rather than Apple's financials. Apple's role in the situation is limited to removing the app from its store and ceasing updates, which is a regulatory compliance issue rather than a financial one. Considering the previous predictions and the fact that the news is more related to TikTok than Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news should be relatively low and close to each other.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news headline raises questions about concerns or doubts regarding Apple Inc.'s current state or future prospects. This type of headline tends to evoke negative sentiments among investors, potentially leading to selling pressure on the stock. While the headline itself does not provide specific negative data, it introduces uncertainty, which can be seen as a red flag by many investors. Additionally, previous predictions show a mix of opinions, but a majority tend towards a negative reaction. Therefore, considering the headline\u2019s tone and the overall trend in previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, are aligning themselves with President-elect Trump, which may suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for tech companies.

The previous rounds show a slight increase in positive sentiment, which I will also consider.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\" is too generic to significantly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct relevance of the headline to Apple's performance.  Some models attempted to connect the headline to other, unrelated news items (political alignments, partnerships, etc.), but these connections are weak and not supported by the headline itself.  The majority of previous predictions lean slightly towards a price rise, but with probabilities clustered around 0.5, indicating substantial uncertainty.  Given the vagueness of the headline and the lack of specific information about Apple, I'm assigning probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting the neutral impact of this generic news item. The wide dispersion of previous predictions further supports this conclusion, suggesting the headline is not a strong driver of price movement.  I'm giving slightly more weight to the probability of a price rise due to the overall positive sentiment in some of the previous predictions, but the difference is minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline raises a concerning question about Apple's future, which could lead to investor uncertainty and negative sentiment.

While it does not specify any negative data, the mere suggestion of worry can influence market perception and lead to negative sentiment among investors. The previous round predictions show a consistent trend of predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.
