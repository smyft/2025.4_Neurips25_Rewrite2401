(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't\nNews Content: By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, are aligning themselves with President-elect Trump, which may suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for tech companies. This could lead to positive sentiment in the market, as investors often react favorably to perceived stability and potential business-friendly policies. However, the historical tensions between Trump and some tech leaders, along with the mixed reactions to political donations, could introduce uncertainty. Overall, the alignment with Trump may be seen as a strategic move to mitigate risks and enhance opportunities, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is expanding its retail presence in China, specifically in a new province (Anhui). This expansion suggests continued growth and investment in a key market. The opening of a new store, especially one designed with sustainable materials and offering the latest products (iPhone 16, MacBook Pro with M4, Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Vision Pro), is generally a positive signal. The emphasis on personalized service, 'Today at Apple' sessions, and special Chinese New Year promotions further enhances the positive outlook. However, the impact of a single store opening on a company as large as Apple is likely to be marginal. Therefore, while the news is positive, it's unlikely to cause a significant surge in the stock price. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\" is very general and doesn't provide any specific information about Apple Inc.  Apple's involvement in the metaverse is not a major focus of the company's current strategy, and this headline doesn't suggest any new developments or initiatives related to Apple and the metaverse. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price change is assumed to be close to the baseline probability of a price change on any given day, which is influenced by many other factors not mentioned in this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline raises a concerning question about Apple's future, which could lead to investor uncertainty and negative sentiment. While the headline does not provide specific negative data, the mere suggestion of worry can influence market perception. Historically, such headlines can lead to short-term stock price declines due to emotional trading. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and market position may mitigate significant drops. The probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a negative reaction based on the headline's tone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple is in talks with Barclays and Synchrony for a credit card partnership. This potential partnership could expand Apple's services segment, which has been a growing area for the company. However, the impact on the stock price is uncertain as it depends on market expectations and the specifics of the partnership. Generally, new partnerships can be viewed positively if they are expected to increase revenue or enhance the company's offerings. Given that this news is about a potential expansion of Apple's services and not a negative event, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. However, without specific details on the terms or expected impact, the probabilities are not extremely skewed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok and its users, rather than Apple's financials. Apple's role in the situation is limited to removing the app from its store and ceasing updates, which is a regulatory compliance issue rather than a financial one. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests concern or doubt about the current state or future prospects of Apple Inc. Such headlines typically evoke negative sentiments among investors, leading to potential selling pressure on the stock. The question posed in the headline implies uncertainty, which can be seen as a red flag for many investors. While it's important to consider various factors like company fundamentals, market conditions, and broader economic trends, the headline alone points towards a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, are aligning themselves with President-elect Trump, which may suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for tech companies. This alignment could lead to positive sentiment in the market, as investors often react favorably to perceived stability and potential business-friendly policies. However, the historical tensions between Trump and some tech leaders, along with the mixed reactions to political donations, introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the strategic move to engage with the new administration may enhance opportunities for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news of Apple opening a new store in Hefei, China, is generally positive. It signifies continued expansion in a key market and demonstrates Apple's commitment to growth. The store features the latest products and services, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Vision Pro, and offers personalized experiences. This aligns with Apple's strategy of enhancing customer engagement and driving sales. However, the impact of a single store opening on a company as large as Apple is likely to be limited. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a positive impact and others being more neutral. Given the positive nature of the news and the overall trend of expansion, I'll slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise compared to the previous round's average. However, I'll also acknowledge the limited impact of a single store opening and the potential for other market factors to influence the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\" is too generic to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the lack of direct relevance of the headline to Apple's performance.  While some models linked the headline to other news (e.g., potential partnerships or political alignments), these connections are tenuous and not directly supported by the provided headline. The majority of previous predictions lean slightly towards a stock price rise, but with probabilities clustered around 0.5, indicating significant uncertainty.  Given the lack of specific information about Apple in the headline, I'm assigning probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting the neutral impact of this generic news item. The wide range of previous predictions further supports this conclusion, suggesting that the headline itself is not a strong driver of price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline raises a concerning question about Apple's future, which could lead to investor uncertainty and negative sentiment.

This potential partnership could expand Apple's services segment, which has been a growing area for the company. Generally, new partnerships can be viewed positively if they are expected to increase revenue or enhance the company's offerings. However, without specific details on the terms or expected impact, the probabilities are not extremely skewed. The partnership could lead to increased revenue and enhance Apple's offerings, but the actual impact will depend on the specifics of the agreement and market expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. as the app is available on the App Store.

This type of headline tends to evoke negative sentiments among investors, potentially leading to selling pressure on the stock. While the headline itself does not provide specific negative data, it introduces uncertainty, which can be seen as a red flag by many investors. Additionally, previous predictions show a mix of opinions, but a majority tend towards a negative reaction. Therefore, considering the headline\u2019s tone and the overall trend in previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that major tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook, are aligning themselves with President-elect Trump, which may suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for tech companies.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct relevance of the headline to Apple's performance.  Some models attempted to connect the headline to other, unrelated news items (political alignments, partnerships, etc.), but these connections are weak and not supported by the headline itself.  The majority of previous predictions lean slightly towards a price rise, but with probabilities clustered around 0.5, indicating substantial uncertainty.  Given the vagueness of the headline and the lack of specific information about Apple, I'm assigning probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting the neutral impact of this generic news item. The wide dispersion of previous predictions further supports this conclusion, suggesting the headline is not a strong driver of price movement.  I'm giving slightly more weight to the probability of a price rise due to the overall positive sentiment in some of the previous predictions, but the difference is minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline raises a concerning question about Apple's future, which could lead to investor uncertainty and negative sentiment.

While it does not specify any negative data, the mere suggestion of worry can influence market perception and lead to negative sentiment among investors.
