(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Thursday\u2019s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 4% to touch a fresh record high to start the year. Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. However, there is also the possibility of a rebound if the upcoming earnings report exceeds expectations. Given the current sentiment and technical indicators, the probability of a stock price fall appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook for leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven,' due to concerns about high valuations and the potential impact of rising interest rates. Ray Dalio's warning, while not always accurate, carries weight due to his reputation and experience. The article also mentions other factors contributing to market uncertainty, such as rising bond yields, a strong dollar, and potential trade wars. While the article doesn't specifically target Apple, the general negative sentiment towards leading stocks and the potential for a market rotation away from expensive names suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple in the short term. However, Apple is a strong company with a loyal customer base, which mitigates some of the downside risk. Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings season for the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants, including Apple. While the overall tone is positive regarding the tech sector's prospects under the Trump administration and the AI boom, Apple's situation is presented more cautiously.  Recent analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales in China and a perceived lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI initiatives suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  The article mentions Apple's Q4 results beat expectations (excluding a one-time charge), but the negative sentiment surrounding recent iPhone sales and analyst downgrades outweighs this positive news.  The overall market sentiment towards tech is positive, but Apple's specific challenges create a countervailing force.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company has strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. Additionally, concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are deemed overdone due to price cuts and potential government subsidies. However, there are challenges ahead, including a forecasted decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and macroeconomic headwinds. BofA has also slightly reduced its price target from $256 to $253, reflecting cautious optimism. Given the balance of positive and negative factors, the stock is likely to react with moderate optimism in the short term due to the strong Q1 results, but longer-term concerns may temper gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola Consumer's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing in India, which was a concern raised after media reports suggested that Apple users were being charged higher fares than Android users for the same rides. This issue was brought to light by an Indian government consumer body. Ola Consumer has clarified that it has a homogenous pricing structure and does not differentiate based on the operating system of the user's cellphone. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of being a phone model that was allegedly charged higher fares, but the article does not contain any direct news about Apple's business operations, financials, or any specific allegations against Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to be strong, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any negative news or concerns that could lead to a fall in the stock price. Therefore, based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been under pressure due to disappointing news around its iPhone market share and recent analyst downgrades. The company is expected to report weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter, particularly regarding iPhone sales and consumer interest in AI. These factors suggest a negative impact on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
