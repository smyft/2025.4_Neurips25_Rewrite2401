(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nA warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.\n\n\"I think it depends on what stocks \u2014 yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,\" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become \"so expensive.\"\n\nIf the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.\n\n\"If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,\" Dalio said, adding, \"Rotation is the important consideration.\"\n\nDalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over the company's investment strategies.\n\nThe investment veteran, with an estimated net worth of $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet \u2014 if at all.There may not be much for stock investors to smile about if Ray Dalio's biggest concerns on US debt come true. The Bridgewater Associates founder (right) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two talked on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\u00b7Yahoo Finance\n\nIn an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation \u2014or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimping consumer purchasing power.\n\nMore recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called \"How Countries Go Broke.\"\n\nWorst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.\n\nRead more: Why TD Ameritrade's former CEO is bullish on the Trump trade\n\nInvestors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration, policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in top Mag Seven names like Nvidia.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nAnother bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini Elon Musk is our best chance in a lifetime at fixing government spending: Former Tesla exec Why you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\n\nStocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month.\n\nDalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,\" said Dalio.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. However, there is also the possibility of a rebound if the upcoming earnings report exceeds expectations. Given the current sentiment and technical indicators, the probability of a stock price fall appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook for leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven,' due to concerns about high valuations and the potential impact of rising interest rates. Ray Dalio's warning, while not always accurate, carries weight due to his reputation and experience. The article also mentions other factors contributing to market uncertainty, such as rising bond yields, a strong dollar, and potential trade wars. While the article doesn't specifically target Apple, the general negative sentiment towards leading stocks and the potential for a market rotation away from expensive names suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple in the short term. However, Apple is a strong company with a loyal customer base, which mitigates some of the downside risk. Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings season for the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants, including Apple. While the overall tone is positive regarding the tech sector's prospects under the Trump administration and the AI boom, Apple's situation is presented more cautiously.  Recent analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales in China and a perceived lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI initiatives suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  The article mentions Apple's Q4 results beat expectations (excluding a one-time charge), but the negative sentiment surrounding recent iPhone sales and analyst downgrades outweighs this positive news.  The overall market sentiment towards tech is positive, but Apple's specific challenges create a countervailing force.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company has strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. Additionally, concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are deemed overdone due to price cuts and potential government subsidies. However, there are challenges ahead, including a forecasted decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and macroeconomic headwinds. BofA has also slightly reduced its price target from $256 to $253, reflecting cautious optimism. Given the balance of positive and negative factors, the stock is likely to react with moderate optimism in the short term due to the strong Q1 results, but longer-term concerns may temper gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola Consumer's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing in India, which was a concern raised after media reports suggested that Apple users were being charged higher fares than Android users for the same rides. This issue was brought to light by an Indian government consumer body. Ola Consumer has clarified that it has a homogenous pricing structure and does not differentiate based on the operating system of the user's cellphone. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of being a phone model that was allegedly charged higher fares, but the article does not contain any direct news about Apple's business operations, financials, or any specific allegations against Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to be strong, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any negative news or concerns that could lead to a fall in the stock price. Therefore, based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been under pressure due to disappointing news around its iPhone market share and recent analyst downgrades. The company is expected to report weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter, particularly regarding iPhone sales and consumer interest in AI. These factors suggest a negative impact on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a major catalyst that could influence stock movement, but the overall sentiment remains bearish due to recent performance and analyst downgrades. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The primary news focuses on Ray Dalio's concerns about expensive leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven,' which includes Apple. He highlights the potential negative impact of rising interest rates on these stocks. While Dalio's predictions aren't always accurate, his views carry weight. The article also mentions broader market uncertainties like rising bond yields and potential trade wars. The previous round of predictions shows a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning bearish due to Apple's specific challenges (e.g., weak iPhone sales) and others leaning bullish due to expected strong earnings and AI potential. Considering Dalio's warning and the existing bearish sentiment, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's inherent strength and potential for positive earnings surprises.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader tech sector is experiencing positive momentum driven by AI investments and government support under the Trump administration, Apple faces specific headwinds.  Analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales in China and a perceived lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI initiatives are significant negative factors.  Although Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations (excluding a one-time charge), the negative sentiment surrounding recent iPhone sales and analyst actions outweigh this positive news in the short term. The probability of a price fall is heightened by the already negative market sentiment reflected in the recent stock price decline and the approaching critical technical level of the 200-day moving average. However, the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the potential for Apple to exceed expectations in its upcoming earnings report offer some counterbalance.  Considering the conflicting factors, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but the probability of a rise is not negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company has strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem.

Given the balance of positive and negative factors, the stock is likely to react with moderate optimism in the short term due to the strong Q1 results, but longer-term concerns may temper gains. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but with some models showing optimism, the current analysis suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the strong Q1 earnings beat and bullish sentiment from BofA.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola Consumer's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing in India, which was a concern raised after media reports suggested that Apple users were being charged higher fares than Android users for the same rides. However, this news does not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or financials. The article does not contain any specific allegations or concerns about Apple's products, services, or financial performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Considering the previous predictions and the overall market sentiment, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various concerns such as weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, the overall probability of the stock price rising is still cautiously optimistic but takes into account the mixed sentiments from previous analyses.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments for Apple Inc., as it has faced recent analyst downgrades and challenges in iPhone sales, especially in China. However, the broader narrative around the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple, suggests optimism driven by strong AI investments and the potential for market leadership in emerging technologies. Despite the recent analyst downgrades and negative market sentiment, there is a belief in the company's resilience and future technological advancements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a major catalyst that could influence stock movement, but the overall sentiment remains bearish due to recent performance and analyst downgrades. While there is potential for a rebound if earnings exceed expectations, the prevailing sentiment and technical indicators suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The current news focuses on Ray Dalio's warning about expensive leading stocks, including Apple, and the potential negative impact of rising interest rates. This is a bearish signal. However, the previous round of predictions shows a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning bearish due to Apple's specific challenges (e.g., weak iPhone sales) and others leaning bullish due to expected strong earnings and AI potential. The trend in the previous round shows a slight shift towards a more bullish outlook compared to round 0. Considering Dalio's warning, the existing bearish sentiment, and the slight bullish trend from the previous round, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's inherent strength and potential for positive earnings surprises. I am also taking into account that Dalio's predictions are not always accurate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader tech sector is experiencing positive momentum driven by AI investments and government support under the Trump administration, Apple faces specific headwinds.

However, the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the potential for Apple to exceed expectations in its upcoming earnings report offer some counterbalance.  Considering the conflicting factors, and the range of predictions from other models, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but the probability of a rise is not negligible.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance. I'm weighting the negative factors (analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales) more heavily than the positive (overall tech sector optimism, potential earnings beat) given the immediacy of the negative news and the short timeframe for the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

However, this news does not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or financials. The article does not contain any specific allegations or concerns about Apple's products, services, or financial performance. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which indicated a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price due to factors such as weak iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and potential strong earnings, the impact of this specific news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business and the mixed sentiments from previous analyses, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as relatively balanced but with a slight leaning towards a fall due to overall market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicated a mix of sentiments due to various concerns such as weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, the overall probability of the stock price rising is cautiously optimistic. However, the positive tone of the current news and the emphasis on AI investments suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. The general sentiment around the Magnificent 7 tech giants is positive, driven by strong AI investments and the potential for market leadership in emerging technologies. However, specific issues such as weak iPhone sales in China and recent analyst downgrades contribute to a bearish outlook. Previous predictions show a mix of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these specific challenges. The upcoming earnings report is a crucial catalyst, and while there is potential for a positive surprise, the existing negative sentiment and technical indicators suggest a higher likelihood of a price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
