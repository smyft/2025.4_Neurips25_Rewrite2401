(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. However, there is also the possibility of a rebound if the upcoming earnings report exceeds expectations. Given the current sentiment and technical indicators, the probability of a stock price fall appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook for leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven,' due to concerns about high valuations and the potential impact of rising interest rates. Ray Dalio's warning, while not always accurate, carries weight due to his reputation and experience. The article also mentions other factors contributing to market uncertainty, such as rising bond yields, a strong dollar, and potential trade wars. While the article doesn't specifically target Apple, the general negative sentiment towards leading stocks and the potential for a market rotation away from expensive names suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple in the short term. However, Apple is a strong company with a loyal customer base, which mitigates some of the downside risk. Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings season for the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants, including Apple. While the overall tone is positive regarding the tech sector's prospects under the Trump administration and the AI boom, Apple's situation is presented more cautiously.  Recent analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales in China and a perceived lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI initiatives suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  The article mentions Apple's Q4 results beat expectations (excluding a one-time charge), but the negative sentiment surrounding recent iPhone sales and analyst downgrades outweighs this positive news.  The overall market sentiment towards tech is positive, but Apple's specific challenges create a countervailing force.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company has strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. Additionally, concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are deemed overdone due to price cuts and potential government subsidies. However, there are challenges ahead, including a forecasted decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and macroeconomic headwinds. BofA has also slightly reduced its price target from $256 to $253, reflecting cautious optimism. Given the balance of positive and negative factors, the stock is likely to react with moderate optimism in the short term due to the strong Q1 results, but longer-term concerns may temper gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola Consumer's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing in India, which was a concern raised after media reports suggested that Apple users were being charged higher fares than Android users for the same rides. This issue was brought to light by an Indian government consumer body. Ola Consumer has clarified that it has a homogenous pricing structure and does not differentiate based on the operating system of the user's cellphone. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of being a phone model that was allegedly charged higher fares, but the article does not contain any direct news about Apple's business operations, financials, or any specific allegations against Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to be strong, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any negative news or concerns that could lead to a fall in the stock price. Therefore, based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been under pressure due to disappointing news around its iPhone market share and recent analyst downgrades. The company is expected to report weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter, particularly regarding iPhone sales and consumer interest in AI. These factors suggest a negative impact on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a major catalyst that could influence stock movement, but the overall sentiment remains bearish due to recent performance and analyst downgrades. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The primary news focuses on Ray Dalio's concerns about expensive leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven,' which includes Apple. He highlights the potential negative impact of rising interest rates on these stocks. While Dalio's predictions aren't always accurate, his views carry weight. The article also mentions broader market uncertainties like rising bond yields and potential trade wars. The previous round of predictions shows a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning bearish due to Apple's specific challenges (e.g., weak iPhone sales) and others leaning bullish due to expected strong earnings and AI potential. Considering Dalio's warning and the existing bearish sentiment, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's inherent strength and potential for positive earnings surprises.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader tech sector is experiencing positive momentum driven by AI investments and government support under the Trump administration, Apple faces specific headwinds.  Analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales in China and a perceived lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI initiatives are significant negative factors.  Although Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations (excluding a one-time charge), the negative sentiment surrounding recent iPhone sales and analyst actions outweigh this positive news in the short term. The probability of a price fall is heightened by the already negative market sentiment reflected in the recent stock price decline and the approaching critical technical level of the 200-day moving average. However, the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the potential for Apple to exceed expectations in its upcoming earnings report offer some counterbalance.  Considering the conflicting factors, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but the probability of a rise is not negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company has strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem.

Given the balance of positive and negative factors, the stock is likely to react with moderate optimism in the short term due to the strong Q1 results, but longer-term concerns may temper gains. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but with some models showing optimism, the current analysis suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the strong Q1 earnings beat and bullish sentiment from BofA.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola Consumer's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing in India, which was a concern raised after media reports suggested that Apple users were being charged higher fares than Android users for the same rides. However, this news does not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or financials. The article does not contain any specific allegations or concerns about Apple's products, services, or financial performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Considering the previous predictions and the overall market sentiment, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various concerns such as weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, the overall probability of the stock price rising is still cautiously optimistic but takes into account the mixed sentiments from previous analyses.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments for Apple Inc., as it has faced recent analyst downgrades and challenges in iPhone sales, especially in China. However, the broader narrative around the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple, suggests optimism driven by strong AI investments and the potential for market leadership in emerging technologies. Despite the recent analyst downgrades and negative market sentiment, there is a belief in the company's resilience and future technological advancements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a major catalyst that could influence stock movement, but the overall sentiment remains bearish due to recent performance and analyst downgrades. While there is potential for a rebound if earnings exceed expectations, the prevailing sentiment and technical indicators suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The current news focuses on Ray Dalio's warning about expensive leading stocks, including Apple, and the potential negative impact of rising interest rates. This is a bearish signal. However, the previous round of predictions shows a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning bearish due to Apple's specific challenges (e.g., weak iPhone sales) and others leaning bullish due to expected strong earnings and AI potential. The trend in the previous round shows a slight shift towards a more bullish outlook compared to round 0. Considering Dalio's warning, the existing bearish sentiment, and the slight bullish trend from the previous round, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's inherent strength and potential for positive earnings surprises. I am also taking into account that Dalio's predictions are not always accurate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.

However, the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the potential for Apple to exceed expectations in its upcoming earnings report offer some counterbalance.  Considering the conflicting factors, and the range of predictions from other models, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but the probability of a rise is not negligible.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance. I'm weighting the negative factors (analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales) more heavily than the positive (overall tech sector optimism, potential earnings beat) given the immediacy of the negative news and the short timeframe for the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

However, this news does not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or financials. The article does not contain any specific allegations or concerns about Apple's products, services, or financial performance. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which indicated a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price due to factors such as weak iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and potential strong earnings, the impact of this specific news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business and the mixed sentiments from previous analyses, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as relatively balanced but with a slight leaning towards a fall due to overall market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicated a mix of sentiments due to various concerns such as weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, the overall probability of the stock price rising is cautiously optimistic. However, the positive tone of the current news and the emphasis on AI investments suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. The general sentiment around the Magnificent 7 tech giants is positive, driven by strong AI investments and the potential for market leadership in emerging technologies. However, specific issues such as weak iPhone sales in China and recent analyst downgrades contribute to a bearish outlook. Previous predictions show a mix of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these specific challenges. The upcoming earnings report is a crucial catalyst, and while there is potential for a positive surprise, the existing negative sentiment and technical indicators suggest a higher likelihood of a price fall.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008.

While there is potential for a rebound if earnings exceed expectations, the prevailing sentiment and technical indicators suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.35 for a rise and 0.65 for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The primary news focuses on Ray Dalio's warning about expensive leading stocks, including Apple, and the potential negative impact of rising interest rates.

I am also taking into account that Dalio's predictions are not always accurate. The fact that the stock has already experienced an 11% decline this year also weighs on the prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.

Considering the conflicting factors, and the range of predictions from other models (which show a persistent bearish bias despite some bullish counterpoints), a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but the probability of a rise is not negligible.  The weight given to negative factors is increased due to the immediacy of the negative news and the short timeframe for the prediction. The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple models suggests a higher likelihood of a price fall than a rise, despite the potential for a positive earnings surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company has strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. Concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are deemed overdone due to price cuts and potential government subsidies. However, challenges include a forecasted decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and macroeconomic headwinds. BofA has slightly reduced its price target from $256 to $253, reflecting cautious optimism.

Previous predictions show a mix of sentiments, with some leaning bearish due to weak iPhone sales and others bullish due to strong earnings potential. Overall, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the expected Q1 earnings beat and bullish sentiment from BofA.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Ola Consumer's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing in India, which was a concern raised after media reports suggested that Apple users were being charged higher fares than Android users for the same rides.
