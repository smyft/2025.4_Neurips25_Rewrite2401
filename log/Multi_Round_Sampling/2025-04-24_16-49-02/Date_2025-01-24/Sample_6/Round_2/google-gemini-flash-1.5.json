(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What to look out for from Mag 7 earnings, including Nvidia and Tesla\nNews Content: The latest earnings season has gotten off to a strong start, with investor attention turning to the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants to see if their results can add to this momentum.\n\nThe major tech stocks led market gains in 2024 and the question for investors now is whether they can continue to do so in 2025.\n\nMore specifically, the Magnificent 7 \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Nvidia \u2014 were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) 25% return in 2024.\n\nTech stocks were already poised to climb higher this year, with Donald Trump's return to the White House, given his pledges to loosen regulations and cut taxes, as well as to invest heavily in AI.\n\nBillionaire tech CEOs have also been flocking to forge closer ties with Trump, with many in attendance at his inauguration.\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nIn the first few days of Trump's second presidential term tech stocks rallied, after he unveiled a $500bn (\u00a3405bn) private-sector investment plan \u2014 known as the \"Stargate\" project \u2014 to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nIn a note on Wednesday, John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Trump\u2019s ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for AI in the early days of his second presidency, and supports our long-standing view that the S&P 500 will thrive in 2025 amid growing investment in, and enthusiasm for, this transformative technology.\"\n\nGiven this theme is set to continue to dominate markets this year, investors will be watching to see which of the Mag 7 stocks are leading the way on the AI trend, or if any are falling behind.\n\nHere's what experts expect to see from the Mag 7 this earnings season.\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nShares in electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla have surged since Trump's election victory in November, with the stock becoming known as part of the \"Trump trade\", as CEO Elon Musk has become a close ally of the president.\n\nMusk, who was a major supporter of Trump campaign, was appointed to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe rally in Tesla shares comes despite the company reporting an annual delivery decline in early January for the first time in more than a decade. Tesla delivered 1.78 million vehicles in 2024, which was below analyst estimates of 1.8 million.\n\nTesla shares fell following the release of these figures and while Musk's expected role of influence on the incoming Trump administration saw the stock rise ahead of the inauguration, it fell back on the first full day of trading after the Republican president returned to office.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThis came after Trump revoked a policy that mandated half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030 and directed his administration to consider eliminating \"unfair subsidies\" on EVs.\n\nMusk had said last year that he didn't think Tesla would be as impacted as competitors by the scrapping of subsidies and believed it could even help the company in the long term.\n\nDespite these headwinds, analysts remain confident about the stock. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said he believed that Tesla would shift away from launching new EVs and focus on \"popularising\" its autonomous driving software, changing his price target on the stock to $500 from $315.\n\nIn terms of financial performance, Tesla posted third quarter revenue of $25.18bn, which was below estimates of $25.4bn. However, adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 came in ahead of an anticipated $0.60, and Tesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\n\nAs for Tesla outlook, the company said in its quarterly earnings deck that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, \"remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025\".\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(TSLA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nMeta (META) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook-owner Meta, is another tech leader that has been trying to build a closer relationship with Trump.\n\nMeta committed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund and recently announced it had appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, an ally of Trump, as one of three new board members.\n\nZuckerberg also recently announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking programme in the US, a move that was considered as part of a repositioning ahead of Trump's return to office.\n\nMeta shares are up 62% over the past year, though the stock fell following the release of its third quarter earnings in October.\n\nThe company delivered earnings per share of $6.03, which bested estimates of $5.25 and revenue of $40.5bn beat forecasts of $40.2bn.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nHowever, expectations were high going into this set of results and Meta guided to fourth quarter revenue guidance of between $45bn and $48bn for the quarter, compared to analyst forecasts of $46.09bn. The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has set itself apart among tech giants by turning AI investments into quick wins. Unlike cloud providers that sell AI capabilities, Meta focuses its efforts on enhancing its own products, driving higher ad revenue.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s not to say the AI push comes cheap,\" he added. \"Zuckerberg sees AI as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the spending reflects that ambition. Investment will be watched closely, with some $15bn needed to be spent over the quarter to achieve full-year spending plans.\n\n\"Investors, understandably cautious after Meta\u2019s past overspending on projects like the metaverse, will be laser-focused on investment plans for 2025.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nAs the Stargate project was unveiled, Microsoft said it signed a new agreement with OpenAI, which included \"changes to the exclusivity on new capacity\".\n\nMicrosoft has been OpenAI's biggest backer and has provided data centre infrastructure for the ChatGPT maker to run its language models.\n\nWhile this new agreement marks a shift in the arrangement between the two companies, Microsoft was still named as one of the key initial technology partners on Stargate.\n\nThe company also recently said it planned to spend $80bn on AI in this fiscal year. Microsoft has also been among the tech companies to jump into the trend of digital agents powered by AI.\n\nIn October, Microsoft announced the rollout of its Copilot features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks.\n\nFuturum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance in December that he projected AI agents represent a $4tn annual global market opportunity over the next five years, describing it as \"a massive opportunity\" for companies.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\nIn terms of broader company performance, Microsoft's fiscal first quarter results beat expectations. The company reported earnings per share of $3.30, versus forecasts of $3.10 and revenue of $65.6bn also topped expectations of $64.5bn.\n\nHowever, market reaction was downbeat, given mixed guidance on the earnings call. There were concerns around pressure on company profit margins in second quarter given the ramp up in AI spending.\n\nShares have had a bumpy ride over the past year, capping gains at nearly 12%.\n\nBritzman said that the key metric to watch in the second quarter results was growth in its cloud computing Azure business, which is expected to come in at 31% to 32%.\n\n\"Microsoft has said more recently that its capacity constraints are resolved, so markets hope to get a better picture of current demand levels in the coming quarters,\" he said. \"Beyond Azure, the rollout of Copilot will also be under scrutiny, with investors eager to see how product development and adoption are progressing after some criticism from peers.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MSFT)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nApple (AAPL) \u2014 reports on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in Apple have come under pressure recently, amid disappointing news around its iPhone market share.\n\nApple's stock has suffered two analyst rating downgrades this week alone. Jefferies (JEF) analyst Edison Lee lowered the investment bank's rating on Apple shares to \"underperform\" and decreased his price target on the stock by 13% to $200.75.\n\nLee said in an investor note that he expected Apple's first quarter results \u2014 which are due out next week \u2014 to come in below expectations, and for the company to miss against estimates for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded Apple from \"buy\" to \"hold\" and lowered its price target on the stock from $275 to $230.\n\nMeanwhile, Counterpoint Research found sales of Apple's iPhones fell 18.2% in China in the December quarter, according to a Bloomberg report. The research also showed that the iPhone gave up its title of the top selling smartphone handsets in China to Huawei Technologies.\n\nRead more: Funds for investors to watch in 2025\n\nAnd data from from market analyst firm Canalys showed that Apple lost its top spot as the smartphone maker with the biggest market share in mainland China.\n\nThe recent fall in the Apple's shares, has seen the company's market valuation down decline to $3.41tn, and chipmaker Nvidia overtake it once again as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.55tn.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $0.97 on revenue on revenue of $94.9bn. The company said it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay \u20ac13bn to Ireland for back taxes.\n\nWithout the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 reports on Thursday 30 January\n\nA major focus for Amazon's fourth quarter results next week will be its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nRevenue for this part of the business came in at $27.5bn in the third quarter, which was in line with Wall Street expectations, but was still up 19% year-on-year.\n\nShares popped following the release of Amazon's third quarter results, as it posted earnings per share of $1.43, which was ahead of estimates of $1.16. Revenue of $158.9bn also beat expectations of $157.29bn.\n\nInvestors also cheered Amazon's guidance for the fourth quarter, with the company expecting net sales to come in at between $181.5bn and $188.5bn.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nAmazon is expecting to report operating income of between $16bn and $20bn, against the $13.2bn it reported for the same period in 2023.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Briztman said: \"As usual, AWS will be the cloud hanging over market sentiment \u2014 any growth materially above 19% should get a warm reception. Investors will also be tuned in for updates on AWS\u2019s AI initiatives and the eye-popping investment Amazon plans to spend in the space.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, let\u2019s not forget Amazon\u2019s trusty old e-commerce arm, often overshadowed by its cloud cousin,\" he added. \"For the first time in a while, it\u2019s showing signs of life, with fresh initiatives like the discount storefront \u2018Amazon Haul\u2019 helping expand its reach. If Amazon can fine-tune automation, there\u2019s potential for some tasty margin expansion too.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) \u2014 reports on Tuesday 4 February\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google-owner Alphabet, was another tech leader in attendance at Trump's inauguration.\n\nA day later, Business Insider reported that Alphabet's chief investment officer Ruth Porat said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that there's a \"tremendous amount of opportunity\" to work with Trump in his second term.\n\nThese comments come after Alphabet has been grappling with regulatory headwinds over the past year. In November, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) asked that Google be forced to sell off its Chrome browser, as part of proposed remedies aimed at ending the company's dominance in internet search.\n\nThis filing came after a judge ruled in favour of prosecutors in a landmark trial in August, who argued that that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly. The judge will will now decide what should happen next in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that is expected to start this year.\n\nRead more: Stocks to watch in European luxury and retail in 2025, according to Deutsche Bank\n\nWhen Trump was asked in an interview in October about whether he believed Google should be broken up, he said: \"Google\u2019s got a lot of power. They\u2019re very bad to me.\"\n\nWhile Trump didn't go into specifics when asked if he would break up the business, he said: \"I\u2019d do something.\"\n\nDespite regulatory concerns, Alphabet has continued to show strong performance, with the company smashing estimates in its third quarter results. Alphabet posted earnings per share of $2.12, compared to expectations of $1.83 and revenue of $88.27bn came in well ahead of estimates of $86.44bn.\n\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, Britzman said that having \"arrived fashionably late to the AI party, Alphabet is now making a splash. AI-powered overviews in Google search are starting to show their value, and investors will be laser-focused on ad revenue, still the core growth driver with a 9.5% uplift expected from [the] fourth-quarter results.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GOOGL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNvidia (NVDA) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 26 February\n\nMarket darling Nvidia will be the last of the Mag 7 to report, with investors eagerly anticipating the earnings for signals on the strength of AI chip demand.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang was one of the few tech execs not to attend Trump's inauguration, though the company was another named as a key initial technology partners on the Stargate project.\n\nShares in Nvidia are up a whopping 145% over the past year, though increasingly high expectations mean markets have become highly sensitive to any disappointing news around the chipmaker.\n\nRead more: Surprising UK pay growth could delay Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cuts\n\nThe stock dipped following the release of its third quarter results, even though Nvidia beat estimates on key metrics. Revenue of $35.1bn was comfortably ahead of analysts estimates of $33.2bn and earnings per share came in at $0.81 beat expectations of $0.74.\n\nHowever, gross margins were lower quarter-on-quarter from 75.1% to 74.6%.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia guided to revenue of $37.5bn for the fourth quarter, plus or minus 2%, which would be just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37bn.\n\nEven so, analysts remain bullish on Nvidia, with Barclays (BARC.L) keeping an \"overweight\" rating on the stock and raising its price target on the stock from $160 to $175.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. However, there is also the possibility of a rebound if the upcoming earnings report exceeds expectations. Given the current sentiment and technical indicators, the probability of a stock price fall appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook for leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven,' due to concerns about high valuations and the potential impact of rising interest rates. Ray Dalio's warning, while not always accurate, carries weight due to his reputation and experience. The article also mentions other factors contributing to market uncertainty, such as rising bond yields, a strong dollar, and potential trade wars. While the article doesn't specifically target Apple, the general negative sentiment towards leading stocks and the potential for a market rotation away from expensive names suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple in the short term. However, Apple is a strong company with a loyal customer base, which mitigates some of the downside risk. Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings season for the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants, including Apple. While the overall tone is positive regarding the tech sector's prospects under the Trump administration and the AI boom, Apple's situation is presented more cautiously.  Recent analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales in China and a perceived lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI initiatives suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  The article mentions Apple's Q4 results beat expectations (excluding a one-time charge), but the negative sentiment surrounding recent iPhone sales and analyst downgrades outweighs this positive news.  The overall market sentiment towards tech is positive, but Apple's specific challenges create a countervailing force.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company has strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. Additionally, concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are deemed overdone due to price cuts and potential government subsidies. However, there are challenges ahead, including a forecasted decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and macroeconomic headwinds. BofA has also slightly reduced its price target from $256 to $253, reflecting cautious optimism. Given the balance of positive and negative factors, the stock is likely to react with moderate optimism in the short term due to the strong Q1 results, but longer-term concerns may temper gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola Consumer's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing in India, which was a concern raised after media reports suggested that Apple users were being charged higher fares than Android users for the same rides. This issue was brought to light by an Indian government consumer body. Ola Consumer has clarified that it has a homogenous pricing structure and does not differentiate based on the operating system of the user's cellphone. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of being a phone model that was allegedly charged higher fares, but the article does not contain any direct news about Apple's business operations, financials, or any specific allegations against Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to be strong, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any negative news or concerns that could lead to a fall in the stock price. Therefore, based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been under pressure due to disappointing news around its iPhone market share and recent analyst downgrades. The company is expected to report weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter, particularly regarding iPhone sales and consumer interest in AI. These factors suggest a negative impact on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which is often seen as a support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a potential target around $208. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a major catalyst that could influence stock movement, but the overall sentiment remains bearish due to recent performance and analyst downgrades. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The primary news focuses on Ray Dalio's concerns about expensive leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven,' which includes Apple. He highlights the potential negative impact of rising interest rates on these stocks. While Dalio's predictions aren't always accurate, his views carry weight. The article also mentions broader market uncertainties like rising bond yields and potential trade wars. The previous round of predictions shows a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning bearish due to Apple's specific challenges (e.g., weak iPhone sales) and others leaning bullish due to expected strong earnings and AI potential. Considering Dalio's warning and the existing bearish sentiment, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's inherent strength and potential for positive earnings surprises.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader tech sector is experiencing positive momentum driven by AI investments and government support under the Trump administration, Apple faces specific headwinds.  Analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales in China and a perceived lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI initiatives are significant negative factors.  Although Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations (excluding a one-time charge), the negative sentiment surrounding recent iPhone sales and analyst actions outweigh this positive news in the short term. The probability of a price fall is heightened by the already negative market sentiment reflected in the recent stock price decline and the approaching critical technical level of the 200-day moving average. However, the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the potential for Apple to exceed expectations in its upcoming earnings report offer some counterbalance.  Considering the conflicting factors, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but the probability of a rise is not negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Considering the previous predictions, which mostly leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but with some models showing optimism, the current analysis suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the strong Q1 earnings beat and bullish sentiment from BofA.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola Consumer's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing in India, which was a concern raised after media reports suggested that Apple users were being charged higher fares than Android users for the same rides. However, this news does not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or financials. The article does not contain any specific allegations or concerns about Apple's products, services, or financial performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Considering the previous predictions and the overall market sentiment, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, with a focus on AI spending and its potential to drive growth. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that the Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various concerns such as weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, the overall probability of the stock price rising is still cautiously optimistic but takes into account the mixed sentiments from previous analyses.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments for Apple Inc., as it has faced recent analyst downgrades and challenges in iPhone sales, especially in China. However, the broader narrative around the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple, suggests optimism driven by strong AI investments and the potential for market leadership in emerging technologies. Despite the recent analyst downgrades and negative market sentiment, there is a belief in the company's resilience and future technological advancements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
