(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Thursday\u2019s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 4% to touch a fresh record high to start the year. Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Ola and Uber, two ride-hailing companies in India, and addresses allegations of differential pricing based on the user's phone model. While this news does not directly impact Apple Inc.'s core business or financial performance, it does touch on consumer perception and potential regulatory scrutiny. Since the allegations were denied by both companies and there is no direct implication for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's strong position in the market, solid financial performance (record revenue, growth in services), and inclusion in a list of 'best Dow stocks,' it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article highlights the overall positive market sentiment driven by AI and potential economic improvements. However, the article's conclusion that other AI stocks are more promising tempers the positive aspects. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Overall, the news is slightly positive, but the emphasis on potentially better AI investments creates some uncertainty. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on several companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly provide positive or negative news specifically about Apple's upcoming earnings report, the overall market sentiment is mixed.  The mention of Trump's return to office and potential policy changes introduces uncertainty.  The chip sector news (ASML and Intel) is mixed, with ASML facing challenges and Intel undergoing a CEO transition.  The luxury sector shows some positive signs, but this is not directly related to Apple.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to *this specific news article* is relatively low.  The probability is more likely to be influenced by the actual earnings report itself, which is not covered in this news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several challenges for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including disappointing iPhone market share data, downgrades from analysts, and weak sales in China. The stock has already been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its potential for growth, highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector and the increasing importance of its services sector. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone sales and a growing services business. Additionally, it notes that Apple's iPhone continues to hold its market position. However, the article does not provide any specific negative news about the company, but rather a general overview of its performance and position in the market. The positive outlook on Apple's performance and its dominance in the consumer electronics sector could lead to increased investor confidence and, subsequently, a rise in its stock price. Nevertheless, the article also mentions that AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, which might slightly reduce the attractiveness of AAPL compared to other tech stocks. Based on this information, we can infer that the stock price might be positively affected by the company's strong performance and position in the market, but the comparison with AI stocks and their potential might slightly temper the enthusiasm for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, who has extensive experience in core Apple technologies, to lead efforts in AI and machine learning, signals a strategic move by the company to address recent setbacks in AI development. Her background in critical projects like the iPhone and Vision Pro suggests she brings valuable expertise that could positively impact the advancement of Siri and other AI initiatives. This could alleviate investor concerns over Apple's lag in AI compared to competitors and potentially boost market confidence. However, the immediate impact on stock price may be limited given the complexity of catching up in AI technology and the competitive landscape.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Ola and Uber, two ride-hailing companies in India, and addresses allegations of differential pricing based on the user's phone model. While this news does not directly impact Apple Inc.'s core business or financial performance, it does touch on consumer perception and potential regulatory scrutiny. Both companies have denied the allegations, which may mitigate any negative sentiment. Given that the news does not present any direct threats or opportunities for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low, with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple. It highlights Apple's inclusion as a potentially good Dow stock, citing its strong position in consumer electronics and growing services sector. The article mentions Apple's solid Q4 2024 performance. However, it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns, which tempers the enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative aspects like potential AI underperformance, while others highlighted positive aspects like strong revenue. Given the current article's slightly positive tone and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is a preview of several companies' upcoming earnings reports, including Apple's.  It doesn't contain any specific news about Apple itself that would significantly impact its stock price. The article mentions a mixed market sentiment, with some sectors showing positive signs (luxury) and others facing challenges (semiconductors).  Trump's return to office introduces political uncertainty, but its impact on Apple is unclear.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement based solely on this news is low. The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of any significant price change.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.  I'll lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the generally positive sentiment around Apple's long-term prospects and the fact that the news is largely neutral, not negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including disappointing iPhone market share data, downgrades from analysts, weak sales in China, and a lack of interest in AI among consumers. The stock has already been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term. However, the broader market sentiment around the 'Magnificent 7' and potential AI investments under Trump's administration could provide some support, though this is less directly impactful for Apple given its current challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector, record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, and growth in its services sector. However, it also mentions that AI stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Additionally, the article notes that AAPL ranks 5th on the list of best Dow stocks to buy right now, indicating a favorable but not overwhelmingly positive view. Based on this information, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall sentiment is not strongly bullish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a mix of positive and negative outlooks, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term. The predictions from other models range from a high of 0.6 for a price rise to a low of 0.3, and from a high of 0.7 for a price fall to a low of 0.4, indicating a wide range of opinions on the stock's movement. Given the technical analysis and the potential impact of the earnings report, a moderate probability of a price fall is estimated.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about Apple appointing Kim Vorrath to tackle AI challenges and boost Siri is a positive indication of Apple's efforts to improve in the AI domain. Although Apple has faced setbacks in AI lately, the appointment of a veteran with extensive experience in core Apple technologies could alleviate investor concerns and boost market confidence. However, the impact on the stock price might be moderate due to the complexity and competitiveness of the AI market. The previous predictions indicate mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a slight positive impact and others leaning towards a negative outlook. Considering all these factors, the overall impact is expected to be positive but not overwhelming.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Ola and Uber, focusing on allegations of differential pricing based on phone models, which does not directly impact Apple's core business. Both companies have denied the allegations, which may mitigate any negative sentiment. Given that the news does not present any direct threats or opportunities for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and others highlighting challenges. Therefore, I estimate a balanced probability of stock price movement, with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. It highlights its inclusion as a potentially good Dow stock, citing its strong position in consumer electronics and growing services sector, and mentions its solid Q4 2024 performance. However, it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns, which tempers the enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative aspects like potential AI underperformance, while others highlighted positive aspects like strong revenue. The current article's slightly positive tone and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The fact that the article is specifically asking if Apple is the *best* Dow stock implies a positive, but potentially debatable, outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article is primarily a preview of upcoming earnings reports for several major companies, including Apple.  It doesn't contain any specific news about Apple's performance or prospects that would significantly influence its stock price. The overall market sentiment presented is mixed, with some sectors showing positive signs (luxury) and others facing challenges (semiconductors).  Trump's return to office introduces political uncertainty, but its direct impact on Apple is unclear.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement based solely on this news is low. The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of any significant price change.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.  Considering the lack of specific Apple-related news in this article and the upcoming earnings report as the major catalyst for price movement, I'm assigning a near-equal probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's generally strong long-term prospects and the overall neutral (not negative) tone of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of the 'Magnificent 7' earnings season, highlighting its strong position in the market but also pointing to recent challenges such as disappointing iPhone market share data, analyst downgrades, and weak sales in China. The stock has been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. However, the broader market sentiment around the 'Magnificent 7' and potential AI investments under Trump's administration could provide some support. Given the mixed signals\u2014negative factors like downgrades and weak sales, balanced by potential support from broader market trends\u2014the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its potential for growth, highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector and the increasing importance of its services sector. Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone sales and a growing services business, is a positive indicator. However, the article also mentions that AI stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the mixed but slightly positive outlook and the range of opinions from previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price, and the stock approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average.

Vorrath's extensive experience in core Apple technologies, including managing the original iPhone software and overseeing operating systems for various Apple devices, suggests she brings valuable expertise that could positively impact the advancement of Siri and other AI initiatives. This could alleviate investor concerns over Apple's lag in AI compared to competitors and potentially boost market confidence. However, the immediate impact on the stock price may be limited given the complexity of catching up in AI technology and the competitive landscape. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a slight positive impact and others leaning towards a negative outlook.
