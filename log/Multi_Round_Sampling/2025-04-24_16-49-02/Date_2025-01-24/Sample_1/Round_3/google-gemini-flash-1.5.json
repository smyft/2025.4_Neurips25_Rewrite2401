(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stocks to watch next week: ASML, Intel, LVMH, Shell and Glencore\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent 7\" are set to dominate earnings focus in the coming week, as five of these tech giants are due to report, though there are still a number of other big names releasing results.\n\nTesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) will be releasing results next week, attracting plenty of investor attention.\n\nMarkets will also be watching what US president Donald Trump has on the policy agenda for his second week back in office.\n\nIn terms of other earnings due out in the coming week, investors will be looking closely at the full-year results from ASML, as it manufactures lithography machines that are key to making chips and so is used to help gauge semiconductor demand.\n\nRead more: What to look out for from Mag 7 earnings, including Nvidia and Tesla\n\nChipmaker Intel (INTC) is due to report, as the company continues its search for a new CEO.\n\nFollowing some positive news in the luxury sector, investors will be hoping LVMH's results can add to optimism.\n\nShell's latest quarterly results come as oil prices come under renewed pressure from comments by newly reinstated US president Donald Trump on lowering prices.\n\nMerger rumours have been swirling around miner Glencore, which is due to release its year-end production report in the coming week.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nASML (ASML.AS) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter and full-year results on Wednesday 29 January\n\nDutch company ASML is considered a bellweather for the global chip industry, so it's full-year results is likely to draw much market focus.\n\nInvestors were rattled in October when the company released its results a day early, which was attributed to a \"technical error\".\n\nIn addition, ASML cut its net sales forecast for 2025, which saw shares tumble.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said that the company expected total net sales of between \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) and \u20ac35bn for 2025, \"which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day\".\n\nHe said that the company expected its gross margin to come in between 51% and 53%, which was also below the range it provided in 2022. Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nAs for its results in the third quarter, ASML delivered total net sales of \u20ac7.5bn, which was up on the previous quarter. For the full 2024 fiscal year, ASML said it expected total net sales of around \u20ac28bn.\n\nSince October's results release, ASML stock has struggled to regain ground, leaving it just less than 2% in the green over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump's approach to chip export policies is likely to be a key consideration for the company and the industry more broadly, given the Biden administration's efforts already to limit China's access to the technology.\n\nDutch prime minister Dick Schoof said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected Trump to keep pushing to restrict ASML's exports of machines to China.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration pushed very hard and I expect the Trump administration pushing the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML.AS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter on Thursday 30 January\n\nChipmaker Intel has suffered a series of struggles, which saw its shares sink last year and has left them down 55% on a one-year basis.\n\nBack in August, Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted from his role as Intel CEO last month, announced \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment on the report.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) \u2014 Releases full-year results on Tuesday 28 January\n\nLuxury stocks rallied on the back of Cartier-owner Richemont's (CFR.SW) latest trading update, which reported a surge in sales in the third quarter.\n\nThis sparked hopes of a turnaround for the luxury sector, which has been out of fashion with investor for some time. Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MC.PA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GLEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc 6954 (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABT)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari RACE (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NTH.DU)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

While this news does not directly impact Apple Inc.'s core business or financial performance, it does touch on consumer perception and potential regulatory scrutiny. Since the allegations were denied by both companies and there is no direct implication for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's strong position in the market, solid financial performance (record revenue, growth in services), and inclusion in a list of 'best Dow stocks,' it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article highlights the overall positive market sentiment driven by AI and potential economic improvements. However, the article's conclusion that other AI stocks are more promising tempers the positive aspects. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Overall, the news is slightly positive, but the emphasis on potentially better AI investments creates some uncertainty. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on several companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly provide positive or negative news specifically about Apple's upcoming earnings report, the overall market sentiment is mixed.  The mention of Trump's return to office and potential policy changes introduces uncertainty.  The chip sector news (ASML and Intel) is mixed, with ASML facing challenges and Intel undergoing a CEO transition.  The luxury sector shows some positive signs, but this is not directly related to Apple.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to *this specific news article* is relatively low.  The probability is more likely to be influenced by the actual earnings report itself, which is not covered in this news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several challenges for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including disappointing iPhone market share data, downgrades from analysts, and weak sales in China. The stock has already been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its potential for growth, highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector and the increasing importance of its services sector. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone sales and a growing services business. Additionally, it notes that Apple's iPhone continues to hold its market position. However, the article does not provide any specific negative news about the company, but rather a general overview of its performance and position in the market. The positive outlook on Apple's performance and its dominance in the consumer electronics sector could lead to increased investor confidence and, subsequently, a rise in its stock price. Nevertheless, the article also mentions that AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, which might slightly reduce the attractiveness of AAPL compared to other tech stocks. Based on this information, we can infer that the stock price might be positively affected by the company's strong performance and position in the market, but the comparison with AI stocks and their potential might slightly temper the enthusiasm for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, who has extensive experience in core Apple technologies, to lead efforts in AI and machine learning, signals a strategic move by the company to address recent setbacks in AI development. Her background in critical projects like the iPhone and Vision Pro suggests she brings valuable expertise that could positively impact the advancement of Siri and other AI initiatives. This could alleviate investor concerns over Apple's lag in AI compared to competitors and potentially boost market confidence. However, the immediate impact on stock price may be limited given the complexity of catching up in AI technology and the competitive landscape.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Ola and Uber, two ride-hailing companies in India, and addresses allegations of differential pricing based on the user's phone model. While this news does not directly impact Apple Inc.'s core business or financial performance, it does touch on consumer perception and potential regulatory scrutiny. Both companies have denied the allegations, which may mitigate any negative sentiment. Given that the news does not present any direct threats or opportunities for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low, with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple. It highlights Apple's inclusion as a potentially good Dow stock, citing its strong position in consumer electronics and growing services sector. The article mentions Apple's solid Q4 2024 performance. However, it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns, which tempers the enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative aspects like potential AI underperformance, while others highlighted positive aspects like strong revenue. Given the current article's slightly positive tone and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is a preview of several companies' upcoming earnings reports, including Apple's.  It doesn't contain any specific news about Apple itself that would significantly impact its stock price. The article mentions a mixed market sentiment, with some sectors showing positive signs (luxury) and others facing challenges (semiconductors).  Trump's return to office introduces political uncertainty, but its impact on Apple is unclear.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement based solely on this news is low. The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of any significant price change.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.  I'll lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the generally positive sentiment around Apple's long-term prospects and the fact that the news is largely neutral, not negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including disappointing iPhone market share data, downgrades from analysts, weak sales in China, and a lack of interest in AI among consumers. The stock has already been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term. However, the broader market sentiment around the 'Magnificent 7' and potential AI investments under Trump's administration could provide some support, though this is less directly impactful for Apple given its current challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector, record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, and growth in its services sector. However, it also mentions that AI stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Additionally, the article notes that AAPL ranks 5th on the list of best Dow stocks to buy right now, indicating a favorable but not overwhelmingly positive view. Based on this information, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall sentiment is not strongly bullish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a mix of positive and negative outlooks, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term. The predictions from other models range from a high of 0.6 for a price rise to a low of 0.3, and from a high of 0.7 for a price fall to a low of 0.4, indicating a wide range of opinions on the stock's movement. Given the technical analysis and the potential impact of the earnings report, a moderate probability of a price fall is estimated.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about Apple appointing Kim Vorrath to tackle AI challenges and boost Siri is a positive indication of Apple's efforts to improve in the AI domain. Although Apple has faced setbacks in AI lately, the appointment of a veteran with extensive experience in core Apple technologies could alleviate investor concerns and boost market confidence. However, the impact on the stock price might be moderate due to the complexity and competitiveness of the AI market. The previous predictions indicate mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a slight positive impact and others leaning towards a negative outlook. Considering all these factors, the overall impact is expected to be positive but not overwhelming.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Ola and Uber, focusing on allegations of differential pricing based on phone models, which does not directly impact Apple's core business. Both companies have denied the allegations, which may mitigate any negative sentiment. Given that the news does not present any direct threats or opportunities for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and others highlighting challenges. Therefore, I estimate a balanced probability of stock price movement, with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. It highlights its inclusion as a potentially good Dow stock, citing its strong position in consumer electronics and growing services sector, and mentions its solid Q4 2024 performance. However, it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns, which tempers the enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative aspects like potential AI underperformance, while others highlighted positive aspects like strong revenue. The current article's slightly positive tone and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The fact that the article is specifically asking if Apple is the *best* Dow stock implies a positive, but potentially debatable, outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article is primarily a preview of upcoming earnings reports for several major companies, including Apple.  It doesn't contain any specific news about Apple's performance or prospects that would significantly influence its stock price. The overall market sentiment presented is mixed, with some sectors showing positive signs (luxury) and others facing challenges (semiconductors).  Trump's return to office introduces political uncertainty, but its direct impact on Apple is unclear.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement based solely on this news is low. The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of any significant price change.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.  Considering the lack of specific Apple-related news in this article and the upcoming earnings report as the major catalyst for price movement, I'm assigning a near-equal probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's generally strong long-term prospects and the overall neutral (not negative) tone of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of the 'Magnificent 7' earnings season, highlighting its strong position in the market but also pointing to recent challenges such as disappointing iPhone market share data, analyst downgrades, and weak sales in China. The stock has been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. However, the broader market sentiment around the 'Magnificent 7' and potential AI investments under Trump's administration could provide some support. Given the mixed signals\u2014negative factors like downgrades and weak sales, balanced by potential support from broader market trends\u2014the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its potential for growth, highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector and the increasing importance of its services sector. Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone sales and a growing services business, is a positive indicator. However, the article also mentions that AI stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the mixed but slightly positive outlook and the range of opinions from previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price, and the stock approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a mix of positive and negative outlooks, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple appointing Kim Vorrath to enhance its AI capabilities and improve Siri is a positive indicator for the company. Vorrath's extensive experience in core Apple technologies, including managing the original iPhone software and overseeing operating systems for various Apple devices, suggests she brings valuable expertise that could positively impact the advancement of Siri and other AI initiatives. This could alleviate investor concerns over Apple's lag in AI compared to competitors and potentially boost market confidence. However, the immediate impact on the stock price may be limited given the complexity of catching up in AI technology and the competitive landscape. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a slight positive impact and others leaning towards a negative outlook. Considering the positive aspect of the news and the complexity of the AI market, the overall impact is expected to be positive but not overwhelming.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

It does not contain any specific news about Apple that would significantly impact its stock price in the short term. The overall market sentiment is mixed, with some sectors showing positive signs (luxury) and others facing challenges (semiconductors). Trump's return to office introduces political uncertainty, but its direct impact on Apple is unclear.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement based solely on this news is low. The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of any significant price change.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.  Considering the lack of specific Apple-related news in this article and the upcoming earnings report as the major catalyst for price movement, I'm assigning a near-equal probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's generally strong long-term prospects and the overall neutral (not negative) tone of the news.  The consensus from previous models leans slightly towards a rise, but the uncertainty is high.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stocks to watch next week: ASML, Intel, LVMH, Shell and Glencore\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```\n"
