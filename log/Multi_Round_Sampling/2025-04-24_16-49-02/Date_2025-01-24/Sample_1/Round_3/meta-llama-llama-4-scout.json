(AAPL) the Best Dow Stock to Buy Right Now?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 12 Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best Dow stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is among the most popular stock market indices globally. Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.\n\nHistorically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23.\n\nTrump\u2019s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nInvesting in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple\u2019s iPhone which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Apple\u2019s services sector continues to grow as the firm reported over 1 billion paid memberships in Q4. The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Ola and Uber, two ride-hailing companies in India, and addresses allegations of differential pricing based on the user's phone model. While this news does not directly impact Apple Inc.'s core business or financial performance, it does touch on consumer perception and potential regulatory scrutiny. Since the allegations were denied by both companies and there is no direct implication for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's strong position in the market, solid financial performance (record revenue, growth in services), and inclusion in a list of 'best Dow stocks,' it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article highlights the overall positive market sentiment driven by AI and potential economic improvements. However, the article's conclusion that other AI stocks are more promising tempers the positive aspects. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Overall, the news is slightly positive, but the emphasis on potentially better AI investments creates some uncertainty. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on several companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly provide positive or negative news specifically about Apple's upcoming earnings report, the overall market sentiment is mixed.  The mention of Trump's return to office and potential policy changes introduces uncertainty.  The chip sector news (ASML and Intel) is mixed, with ASML facing challenges and Intel undergoing a CEO transition.  The luxury sector shows some positive signs, but this is not directly related to Apple.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to *this specific news article* is relatively low.  The probability is more likely to be influenced by the actual earnings report itself, which is not covered in this news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several challenges for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including disappointing iPhone market share data, downgrades from analysts, and weak sales in China. The stock has already been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its potential for growth, highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector and the increasing importance of its services sector. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone sales and a growing services business. Additionally, it notes that Apple's iPhone continues to hold its market position. However, the article does not provide any specific negative news about the company, but rather a general overview of its performance and position in the market. The positive outlook on Apple's performance and its dominance in the consumer electronics sector could lead to increased investor confidence and, subsequently, a rise in its stock price. Nevertheless, the article also mentions that AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, which might slightly reduce the attractiveness of AAPL compared to other tech stocks. Based on this information, we can infer that the stock price might be positively affected by the company's strong performance and position in the market, but the comparison with AI stocks and their potential might slightly temper the enthusiasm for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, who has extensive experience in core Apple technologies, to lead efforts in AI and machine learning, signals a strategic move by the company to address recent setbacks in AI development. Her background in critical projects like the iPhone and Vision Pro suggests she brings valuable expertise that could positively impact the advancement of Siri and other AI initiatives. This could alleviate investor concerns over Apple's lag in AI compared to competitors and potentially boost market confidence. However, the immediate impact on stock price may be limited given the complexity of catching up in AI technology and the competitive landscape.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Ola and Uber, two ride-hailing companies in India, and addresses allegations of differential pricing based on the user's phone model. While this news does not directly impact Apple Inc.'s core business or financial performance, it does touch on consumer perception and potential regulatory scrutiny. Both companies have denied the allegations, which may mitigate any negative sentiment. Given that the news does not present any direct threats or opportunities for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low, with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple. It highlights Apple's inclusion as a potentially good Dow stock, citing its strong position in consumer electronics and growing services sector. The article mentions Apple's solid Q4 2024 performance. However, it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns, which tempers the enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative aspects like potential AI underperformance, while others highlighted positive aspects like strong revenue. Given the current article's slightly positive tone and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is a preview of several companies' upcoming earnings reports, including Apple's.  It doesn't contain any specific news about Apple itself that would significantly impact its stock price. The article mentions a mixed market sentiment, with some sectors showing positive signs (luxury) and others facing challenges (semiconductors).  Trump's return to office introduces political uncertainty, but its impact on Apple is unclear.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement based solely on this news is low. The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of any significant price change.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.  I'll lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the generally positive sentiment around Apple's long-term prospects and the fact that the news is largely neutral, not negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including disappointing iPhone market share data, downgrades from analysts, weak sales in China, and a lack of interest in AI among consumers. The stock has already been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term. However, the broader market sentiment around the 'Magnificent 7' and potential AI investments under Trump's administration could provide some support, though this is less directly impactful for Apple given its current challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector, record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, and growth in its services sector. However, it also mentions that AI stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Additionally, the article notes that AAPL ranks 5th on the list of best Dow stocks to buy right now, indicating a favorable but not overwhelmingly positive view. Based on this information, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the overall sentiment is not strongly bullish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a mix of positive and negative outlooks, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term. The predictions from other models range from a high of 0.6 for a price rise to a low of 0.3, and from a high of 0.7 for a price fall to a low of 0.4, indicating a wide range of opinions on the stock's movement. Given the technical analysis and the potential impact of the earnings report, a moderate probability of a price fall is estimated.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about Apple appointing Kim Vorrath to tackle AI challenges and boost Siri is a positive indication of Apple's efforts to improve in the AI domain. Although Apple has faced setbacks in AI lately, the appointment of a veteran with extensive experience in core Apple technologies could alleviate investor concerns and boost market confidence. However, the impact on the stock price might be moderate due to the complexity and competitiveness of the AI market. The previous predictions indicate mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a slight positive impact and others leaning towards a negative outlook. Considering all these factors, the overall impact is expected to be positive but not overwhelming.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Ola and Uber, focusing on allegations of differential pricing based on phone models, which does not directly impact Apple's core business. Both companies have denied the allegations, which may mitigate any negative sentiment. Given that the news does not present any direct threats or opportunities for Apple, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and others highlighting challenges. Therefore, I estimate a balanced probability of stock price movement, with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. It highlights its inclusion as a potentially good Dow stock, citing its strong position in consumer electronics and growing services sector, and mentions its solid Q4 2024 performance. However, it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns, which tempers the enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative aspects like potential AI underperformance, while others highlighted positive aspects like strong revenue. The current article's slightly positive tone and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The fact that the article is specifically asking if Apple is the *best* Dow stock implies a positive, but potentially debatable, outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article is primarily a preview of upcoming earnings reports for several major companies, including Apple.  It doesn't contain any specific news about Apple's performance or prospects that would significantly influence its stock price. The overall market sentiment presented is mixed, with some sectors showing positive signs (luxury) and others facing challenges (semiconductors).  Trump's return to office introduces political uncertainty, but its direct impact on Apple is unclear.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement based solely on this news is low. The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of any significant price change.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.  Considering the lack of specific Apple-related news in this article and the upcoming earnings report as the major catalyst for price movement, I'm assigning a near-equal probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's generally strong long-term prospects and the overall neutral (not negative) tone of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of the 'Magnificent 7' earnings season, highlighting its strong position in the market but also pointing to recent challenges such as disappointing iPhone market share data, analyst downgrades, and weak sales in China. The stock has been under pressure, with Nvidia overtaking it as the most valuable company. Analysts expect the upcoming earnings to miss estimates due to weak iPhone sales and lack of AI momentum. However, the broader market sentiment around the 'Magnificent 7' and potential AI investments under Trump's administration could provide some support. Given the mixed signals\u2014negative factors like downgrades and weak sales, balanced by potential support from broader market trends\u2014the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its potential for growth, highlighting its strong performance in the consumer electronics sector and the increasing importance of its services sector. Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone sales and a growing services business, is a positive indicator. However, the article also mentions that AI stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. The hedge fund sentiment is positive with 158 hedge funds holding the stock. Considering the mixed but slightly positive outlook and the range of opinions from previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price, and the stock approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average.

Vorrath's extensive experience in core Apple technologies, including managing the original iPhone software and overseeing operating systems for various Apple devices, suggests she brings valuable expertise that could positively impact the advancement of Siri and other AI initiatives. This could alleviate investor concerns over Apple's lag in AI compared to competitors and potentially boost market confidence. However, the immediate impact on the stock price may be limited given the complexity of catching up in AI technology and the competitive landscape. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a slight positive impact and others leaning towards a negative outlook. Considering the positive aspect of the news and the complexity of the AI market, the overall impact is expected to be positive but not overwhelming.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
