(AAPL) the Best Dow Stock to Buy Right Now?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 12 Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best Dow stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is among the most popular stock market indices globally. Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.\n\nHistorically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23.\n\nTrump\u2019s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nInvesting in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple\u2019s iPhone which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Apple\u2019s services sector continues to grow as the firm reported over 1 billion paid memberships in Q4. The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the tech sector. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is high, while the potential for a decline is mitigated by the strong fundamentals and positive market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the growing corporate resistance, including Apple facing a shareholder vote on diversity policies in February. While some argue these programs are costly, data suggests discrimination has significant economic costs. The fact that companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase are standing firm on their DEI values, and Costco shareholders voted to defend diversity policies, suggests a growing trend of corporate commitment to DEI. For Apple, the upcoming shareholder vote is the most direct impact. A successful defense of DEI policies could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility, while a failure could be seen negatively. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's financial performance is driven by many other factors. Given the mixed signals and the relatively small direct impact, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a neutral to slightly positive reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 2024 results show strong revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks.  The article ranks Apple 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy, suggesting it's a good investment but not the best.  The inclusion of CDT Capital Management's quote expressing caution about overvalued AI stocks, despite acknowledging AI's potential, adds a layer of uncertainty.  The overall positive economic outlook and Apple's strong financial performance suggest a potential for price increase, but the article's focus on the superior potential of AI stocks implies a relatively lower probability of significant price appreciation compared to other AI-focused companies. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low, reflecting the overall positive fundamentals but tempered by the AI market's influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the Big Tech earnings lineup, the direct focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending and broader tech sector optimism. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the general bullish tone on Big Tech, there is a likelihood of positive market sentiment spilling over to AAPL. However, the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple in the news tempers the upside probability. The probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to sector-wide optimism, while the probability of a fall is low unless Apple's earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs have economic benefits. Given that Apple is facing a similar vote in February to defend its diversity policies, the company's commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and diversity. This could lead to a slight increase in the stock price. However, the overall market reaction to Trump's initiative and the upcoming vote may be uncertain, and the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's stock price has declined year-to-date and is currently trading with a high forward P/E ratio, despite being a Magnificent 7 stock. It has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating a bearish outlook. The news does not provide positive catalysts that could drive the stock price up, suggesting it might continue its downward trend.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the tech sector. While there are some concerns regarding potential tariffs and geopolitical tensions, the strong fundamentals and positive market conditions suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of a price increase, tempered by some risk factors that could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and Apple's stance on the issue. While some argue against DEI programs due to cost, the article highlights data suggesting significant economic costs associated with discrimination. Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on diversity policies is a key factor. Given the mixed reactions and the fact that other companies are standing firm on DEI values, the impact on Apple's stock is uncertain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight lean towards a negative impact, especially given the Qwen model's bearish outlook and Apple's current market position. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's financial performance is driven by many other factors. I will adjust the probabilities slightly towards a more neutral stance, acknowledging the potential for both positive and negative reactions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company reported strong Q4 2024 results, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks, suggesting that Apple, while a strong performer, might not be the best investment opportunity compared to other AI-focused companies.  The ranking of Apple as 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy further supports this.  The inclusion of a cautious quote from CDT Capital Management regarding overvalued AI stocks adds to the uncertainty.  Previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a high probability of a price fall.  The overall positive economic outlook and Apple's strong financial performance suggest a potential for price increase, but the article's focus on the superior potential of AI stocks and the mixed previous predictions temper the expectation of a significant price appreciation. The DEI issue is a secondary factor and unlikely to be a major driver of short-term price movement. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a strong, specific catalyst for a significant price movement in either direction, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is most likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a bullish sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta.

(AAPL) is one of the tech giants set to report earnings next week, along with Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. The article highlights that the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple, will be in focus. There is no specific news about Apple that would directly impact its stock price. However, the overall sentiment around tech giants and their upcoming earnings reports is positive, which could lead to a moderate increase in Apple's stock price. The probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall, given the positive sector-wide sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values.

(AAPL). The overall sentiment seems mixed with some models predicting a slight upward trend due to Apple's strong position in the tech sector and potential for positive market sentiment. However, other models highlight the declining stock price year-to-date, its high forward P/E ratio, and its Zacks Sell rating. Considering these mixed signals and the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the potential for a decline remains due to the current bearish outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. Despite some concerns regarding potential tariffs and geopolitical tensions, the overall market sentiment remains optimistic, particularly in the tech sector. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with many leaning towards a positive outlook due to Apple's strong fundamentals and recent performance. However, the mixed signals regarding the impact of DEI policies and the competitive landscape with AI stocks temper the expectations for significant price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging some risk factors that could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and Apple's stance on the issue.

While the company shows strong Q4 2024 results and a positive overall economic outlook is predicted, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks, suggesting that Apple, while strong, might not be the best investment compared to other AI-focused companies.  Apple's ranking as 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy reinforces this.  A cautious quote from CDT Capital Management regarding overvalued AI stocks adds uncertainty.

Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc.

While the company reported strong Q4 2024 results and benefits from a generally positive economic forecast, the article highlights the current market enthusiasm for AI stocks, suggesting that Apple, despite its strength, might not be the most attractive investment compared to other AI-focused companies.  This is reinforced by Apple's ranking as only the 5th best Dow stock to buy.  A cautious quote from CDT Capital Management regarding overvalued AI stocks adds to the uncertainty.
