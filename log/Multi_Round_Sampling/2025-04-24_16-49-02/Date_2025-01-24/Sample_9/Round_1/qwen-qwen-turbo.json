A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the tech sector. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is high, while the potential for a decline is mitigated by the strong fundamentals and positive market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the growing corporate resistance, including Apple facing a shareholder vote on diversity policies in February. While some argue these programs are costly, data suggests discrimination has significant economic costs. The fact that companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase are standing firm on their DEI values, and Costco shareholders voted to defend diversity policies, suggests a growing trend of corporate commitment to DEI. For Apple, the upcoming shareholder vote is the most direct impact. A successful defense of DEI policies could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility, while a failure could be seen negatively. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's financial performance is driven by many other factors. Given the mixed signals and the relatively small direct impact, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a neutral to slightly positive reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 2024 results show strong revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks.  The article ranks Apple 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy, suggesting it's a good investment but not the best.  The inclusion of CDT Capital Management's quote expressing caution about overvalued AI stocks, despite acknowledging AI's potential, adds a layer of uncertainty.  The overall positive economic outlook and Apple's strong financial performance suggest a potential for price increase, but the article's focus on the superior potential of AI stocks implies a relatively lower probability of significant price appreciation compared to other AI-focused companies. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low, reflecting the overall positive fundamentals but tempered by the AI market's influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the Big Tech earnings lineup, the direct focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending and broader tech sector optimism. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the general bullish tone on Big Tech, there is a likelihood of positive market sentiment spilling over to AAPL. However, the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple in the news tempers the upside probability. The probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to sector-wide optimism, while the probability of a fall is low unless Apple's earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs have economic benefits. Given that Apple is facing a similar vote in February to defend its diversity policies, the company's commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and diversity. This could lead to a slight increase in the stock price. However, the overall market reaction to Trump's initiative and the upcoming vote may be uncertain, and the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's stock price has declined year-to-date and is currently trading with a high forward P/E ratio, despite being a Magnificent 7 stock. It has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating a bearish outlook. The news does not provide positive catalysts that could drive the stock price up, suggesting it might continue its downward trend.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
