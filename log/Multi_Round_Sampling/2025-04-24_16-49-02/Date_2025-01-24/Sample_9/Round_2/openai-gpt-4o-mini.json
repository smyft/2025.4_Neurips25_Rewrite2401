(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is Apple (AAPL) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among The Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned Apple widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nOn October 31, the company announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, beating Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. It posted a quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue, registered a 6% growth in revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest iPhone device, launched on September 20, gave Apple only a week of sales ahead of the earnings call. Despite that, the tech giant had a record business performance during the month, driving nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow. This allowed the company to return over $29 billion to shareholders for Q4 in dividends and repurchases.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a consensus Buy rating and average share price upside potential of 8%.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the tech sector. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is high, while the potential for a decline is mitigated by the strong fundamentals and positive market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the growing corporate resistance, including Apple facing a shareholder vote on diversity policies in February. While some argue these programs are costly, data suggests discrimination has significant economic costs. The fact that companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase are standing firm on their DEI values, and Costco shareholders voted to defend diversity policies, suggests a growing trend of corporate commitment to DEI. For Apple, the upcoming shareholder vote is the most direct impact. A successful defense of DEI policies could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility, while a failure could be seen negatively. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's financial performance is driven by many other factors. Given the mixed signals and the relatively small direct impact, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a neutral to slightly positive reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 2024 results show strong revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks.  The article ranks Apple 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy, suggesting it's a good investment but not the best.  The inclusion of CDT Capital Management's quote expressing caution about overvalued AI stocks, despite acknowledging AI's potential, adds a layer of uncertainty.  The overall positive economic outlook and Apple's strong financial performance suggest a potential for price increase, but the article's focus on the superior potential of AI stocks implies a relatively lower probability of significant price appreciation compared to other AI-focused companies. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low, reflecting the overall positive fundamentals but tempered by the AI market's influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the Big Tech earnings lineup, the direct focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending and broader tech sector optimism. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the general bullish tone on Big Tech, there is a likelihood of positive market sentiment spilling over to AAPL. However, the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple in the news tempers the upside probability. The probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to sector-wide optimism, while the probability of a fall is low unless Apple's earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs have economic benefits. Given that Apple is facing a similar vote in February to defend its diversity policies, the company's commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and diversity. This could lead to a slight increase in the stock price. However, the overall market reaction to Trump's initiative and the upcoming vote may be uncertain, and the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's stock price has declined year-to-date and is currently trading with a high forward P/E ratio, despite being a Magnificent 7 stock. It has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating a bearish outlook. The news does not provide positive catalysts that could drive the stock price up, suggesting it might continue its downward trend.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the tech sector. While there are some concerns regarding potential tariffs and geopolitical tensions, the strong fundamentals and positive market conditions suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of a price increase, tempered by some risk factors that could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and Apple's stance on the issue. While some argue against DEI programs due to cost, the article highlights data suggesting significant economic costs associated with discrimination. Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on diversity policies is a key factor. Given the mixed reactions and the fact that other companies are standing firm on DEI values, the impact on Apple's stock is uncertain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight lean towards a negative impact, especially given the Qwen model's bearish outlook and Apple's current market position. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's financial performance is driven by many other factors. I will adjust the probabilities slightly towards a more neutral stance, acknowledging the potential for both positive and negative reactions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company reported strong Q4 2024 results, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks, suggesting that Apple, while a strong performer, might not be the best investment opportunity compared to other AI-focused companies.  The ranking of Apple as 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy further supports this.  The inclusion of a cautious quote from CDT Capital Management regarding overvalued AI stocks adds to the uncertainty.  Previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a high probability of a price fall.  The overall positive economic outlook and Apple's strong financial performance suggest a potential for price increase, but the article's focus on the superior potential of AI stocks and the mixed previous predictions temper the expectation of a significant price appreciation. The DEI issue is a secondary factor and unlikely to be a major driver of short-term price movement. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a strong, specific catalyst for a significant price movement in either direction, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is most likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a bullish sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the Big Tech earnings lineup, the direct focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending and broader tech sector optimism. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the general bullish tone on Big Tech, there is a likelihood of positive market sentiment spilling over to AAPL. However, the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple in the news tempers the upside probability. The probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to sector-wide optimism, while the probability of a fall is low unless Apple's earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the tech giants set to report earnings next week, along with Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. The article highlights that the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple, will be in focus. There is no specific news about Apple that would directly impact its stock price. However, the overall sentiment around tech giants and their upcoming earnings reports is positive, which could lead to a moderate increase in Apple's stock price. The probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall, given the positive sector-wide sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs have economic benefits. Given that Apple is facing a similar vote in February to defend its diversity policies, the company's commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and diversity. This could lead to a slight increase in the stock price. However, the overall market reaction to Trump's initiative and the upcoming vote may be uncertain, and the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited. Considering the mixed signals from other models, with some predicting a higher probability of a rise and others a higher probability of a fall, and taking into account the general trend of corporate commitment to DEI, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers a broad range of stocks and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The overall sentiment seems mixed with some models predicting a slight upward trend due to Apple's strong position in the tech sector and potential for positive market sentiment. However, other models highlight the declining stock price year-to-date, its high forward P/E ratio, and its Zacks Sell rating. Considering these mixed signals and the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the potential for a decline remains due to the current bearish outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
