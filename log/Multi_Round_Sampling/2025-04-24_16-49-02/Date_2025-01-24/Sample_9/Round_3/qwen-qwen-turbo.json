A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the tech sector. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is high, while the potential for a decline is mitigated by the strong fundamentals and positive market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the growing corporate resistance, including Apple facing a shareholder vote on diversity policies in February. While some argue these programs are costly, data suggests discrimination has significant economic costs. The fact that companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase are standing firm on their DEI values, and Costco shareholders voted to defend diversity policies, suggests a growing trend of corporate commitment to DEI. For Apple, the upcoming shareholder vote is the most direct impact. A successful defense of DEI policies could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility, while a failure could be seen negatively. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's financial performance is driven by many other factors. Given the mixed signals and the relatively small direct impact, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a neutral to slightly positive reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 2024 results show strong revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks.  The article ranks Apple 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy, suggesting it's a good investment but not the best.  The inclusion of CDT Capital Management's quote expressing caution about overvalued AI stocks, despite acknowledging AI's potential, adds a layer of uncertainty.  The overall positive economic outlook and Apple's strong financial performance suggest a potential for price increase, but the article's focus on the superior potential of AI stocks implies a relatively lower probability of significant price appreciation compared to other AI-focused companies. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low, reflecting the overall positive fundamentals but tempered by the AI market's influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the Big Tech earnings lineup, the direct focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending and broader tech sector optimism. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the general bullish tone on Big Tech, there is a likelihood of positive market sentiment spilling over to AAPL. However, the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple in the news tempers the upside probability. The probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to sector-wide optimism, while the probability of a fall is low unless Apple's earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs have economic benefits. Given that Apple is facing a similar vote in February to defend its diversity policies, the company's commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and diversity. This could lead to a slight increase in the stock price. However, the overall market reaction to Trump's initiative and the upcoming vote may be uncertain, and the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's stock price has declined year-to-date and is currently trading with a high forward P/E ratio, despite being a Magnificent 7 stock. It has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating a bearish outlook. The news does not provide positive catalysts that could drive the stock price up, suggesting it might continue its downward trend.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the tech sector. While there are some concerns regarding potential tariffs and geopolitical tensions, the strong fundamentals and positive market conditions suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of a price increase, tempered by some risk factors that could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and Apple's stance on the issue. While some argue against DEI programs due to cost, the article highlights data suggesting significant economic costs associated with discrimination. Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on diversity policies is a key factor. Given the mixed reactions and the fact that other companies are standing firm on DEI values, the impact on Apple's stock is uncertain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight lean towards a negative impact, especially given the Qwen model's bearish outlook and Apple's current market position. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's financial performance is driven by many other factors. I will adjust the probabilities slightly towards a more neutral stance, acknowledging the potential for both positive and negative reactions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company reported strong Q4 2024 results, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks, suggesting that Apple, while a strong performer, might not be the best investment opportunity compared to other AI-focused companies.  The ranking of Apple as 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy further supports this.  The inclusion of a cautious quote from CDT Capital Management regarding overvalued AI stocks adds to the uncertainty.  Previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a high probability of a price fall.  The overall positive economic outlook and Apple's strong financial performance suggest a potential for price increase, but the article's focus on the superior potential of AI stocks and the mixed previous predictions temper the expectation of a significant price appreciation. The DEI issue is a secondary factor and unlikely to be a major driver of short-term price movement. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a strong, specific catalyst for a significant price movement in either direction, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is most likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a bullish sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the Big Tech earnings lineup, the direct focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending and broader tech sector optimism.

However, the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple in the news tempers the upside probability. The probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to sector-wide optimism, while the probability of a fall is low unless Apple's earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the tech giants set to report earnings next week, along with Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. The article highlights that the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple, will be in focus. There is no specific news about Apple that would directly impact its stock price. However, the overall sentiment around tech giants and their upcoming earnings reports is positive, which could lead to a moderate increase in Apple's stock price. The probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall, given the positive sector-wide sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs have economic benefits.

However, the overall market reaction to Trump's initiative and the upcoming vote may be uncertain, and the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited. Considering the mixed signals from other models, with some predicting a higher probability of a rise and others a higher probability of a fall, and taking into account the general trend of corporate commitment to DEI, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers a broad range of stocks and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The overall sentiment seems mixed with some models predicting a slight upward trend due to Apple's strong position in the tech sector and potential for positive market sentiment. However, other models highlight the declining stock price year-to-date, its high forward P/E ratio, and its Zacks Sell rating. Considering these mixed signals and the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the potential for a decline remains due to the current bearish outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. Despite some concerns regarding potential tariffs and geopolitical tensions, the overall market sentiment remains optimistic, particularly in the tech sector. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with many leaning towards a positive outlook due to Apple's strong fundamentals and recent performance. However, the mixed signals regarding the impact of DEI policies and the competitive landscape with AI stocks temper the expectations for significant price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging some risk factors that could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and Apple's stance on the issue. While some argue against DEI programs due to cost, the article highlights data suggesting significant economic costs associated with discrimination. Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on diversity policies is a key factor. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight lean towards a negative impact, especially given the Qwen model's bearish outlook and Apple's current market position. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's financial performance is driven by many other factors. I will adjust the probabilities slightly towards a more neutral stance, acknowledging the potential for both positive and negative reactions. The trend of previous predictions shows a slight decrease in the probability of stock price rising, and a slight increase in the probability of stock price falling. Therefore, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company shows strong Q4 2024 results and a positive overall economic outlook is predicted, the article emphasizes the current market excitement surrounding AI stocks, suggesting that Apple, while strong, might not be the best investment compared to other AI-focused companies.  Apple's ranking as 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy reinforces this.  A cautious quote from CDT Capital Management regarding overvalued AI stocks adds uncertainty.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the mixed signals. The DEI issue is a secondary factor unlikely to be a major short-term driver. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a strong catalyst for significant price movement, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is most likely.  The consensus from previous models leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the uncertainty warrants a more conservative estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, with analyst Dan Ives emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments, particularly by Meta.

Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the general bullish tone on Big Tech suggest a likelihood of positive market sentiment spilling over to AAPL. However, the lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple in the news tempers the upside probability. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a moderate rise due to sector-wide optimism, while others highlight Apple's current bearish indicators like a high P/E ratio and Zacks Sell rating. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the tech giants set to report earnings next week, along with Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.
