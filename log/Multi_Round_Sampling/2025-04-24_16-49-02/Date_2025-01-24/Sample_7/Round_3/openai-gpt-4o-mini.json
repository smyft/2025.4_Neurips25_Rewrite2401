(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stocks to watch next week: ASML, Intel, LVMH, Shell and Glencore\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent 7\" are set to dominate earnings focus in the coming week, as five of these tech giants are due to report, though there are still a number of other big names releasing results.\n\nTesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) will be releasing results next week, attracting plenty of investor attention.\n\nMarkets will also be watching what US president Donald Trump has on the policy agenda for his second week back in office.\n\nIn terms of other earnings due out in the coming week, investors will be looking closely at the full-year results from ASML, as it manufactures lithography machines that are key to making chips and so is used to help gauge semiconductor demand.\n\nRead more: What to look out for from Mag 7 earnings, including Nvidia and Tesla\n\nChipmaker Intel (INTC) is due to report, as the company continues its search for a new CEO.\n\nFollowing some positive news in the luxury sector, investors will be hoping LVMH's results can add to optimism.\n\nShell's latest quarterly results come as oil prices come under renewed pressure from comments by newly reinstated US president Donald Trump on lowering prices.\n\nMerger rumours have been swirling around miner Glencore, which is due to release its year-end production report in the coming week.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nASML (ASML.AS) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter and full-year results on Wednesday 29 January\n\nDutch company ASML is considered a bellweather for the global chip industry, so it's full-year results is likely to draw much market focus.\n\nInvestors were rattled in October when the company released its results a day early, which was attributed to a \"technical error\".\n\nIn addition, ASML cut its net sales forecast for 2025, which saw shares tumble.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said that the company expected total net sales of between \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) and \u20ac35bn for 2025, \"which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day\".\n\nHe said that the company expected its gross margin to come in between 51% and 53%, which was also below the range it provided in 2022. Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nAs for its results in the third quarter, ASML delivered total net sales of \u20ac7.5bn, which was up on the previous quarter. For the full 2024 fiscal year, ASML said it expected total net sales of around \u20ac28bn.\n\nSince October's results release, ASML stock has struggled to regain ground, leaving it just less than 2% in the green over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump's approach to chip export policies is likely to be a key consideration for the company and the industry more broadly, given the Biden administration's efforts already to limit China's access to the technology.\n\nDutch prime minister Dick Schoof said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected Trump to keep pushing to restrict ASML's exports of machines to China.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration pushed very hard and I expect the Trump administration pushing the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML.AS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter on Thursday 30 January\n\nChipmaker Intel has suffered a series of struggles, which saw its shares sink last year and has left them down 55% on a one-year basis.\n\nBack in August, Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted from his role as Intel CEO last month, announced \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment on the report.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) \u2014 Releases full-year results on Tuesday 28 January\n\nLuxury stocks rallied on the back of Cartier-owner Richemont's (CFR.SW) latest trading update, which reported a surge in sales in the third quarter.\n\nThis sparked hopes of a turnaround for the luxury sector, which has been out of fashion with investor for some time. Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MC.PA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GLEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc 6954 (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABT)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari RACE (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NTH.DU)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

(AAPL) is set to report its earnings next week, which typically generates significant investor interest and can lead to volatility in the stock price. The overall market sentiment appears cautious due to mixed signals from other tech companies and external factors such as Trump's policy agenda. Given the historical performance of AAPL around earnings reports, there is a reasonable chance of a price rise if the results exceed expectations, but the uncertainty surrounding the broader market and potential negative sentiment could also lead to a price decline. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to reflect a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The immediate term (Q1 earnings) is expected to be positive, which typically drives the stock price up. However, the medium-term (March quarter and FY25/26) outlook is less optimistic due to projected iPhone sales decline and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence. BofA's continued bullish stance, citing strong cash flow and potential product launches, provides some counterweight to the negative forecasts. The price target adjustment, while slightly downward, still suggests upside potential. Considering these factors, the positive Q1 earnings are likely to have a stronger immediate impact than the longer-term concerns, but the negative forecasts will likely temper the rise. The price target adjustment also suggests a limited upside. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding slowing iPhone sales, regulatory pressures on services, and the uncertain success of the Vision Pro headset.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high indicates a bearish sentiment already present in the market.  The earnings call's commentary on these key areas (iPhone sales, services growth, Vision Pro, and buybacks) will heavily influence investor reaction.  Given the mixed signals and existing bearish sentiment, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, although a significant fall is not guaranteed. The macro environment also adds uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant underperformance in 2025, with an 11% slump, marking its worst start since 2008. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a key technical support level. Breaching this level could signal further downside, as noted by technical analysts. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical catalyst, but current sentiment leans negative due to the stock's recent performance and technical indicators. While there's potential for a rebound if earnings surprise positively, the immediate technical outlook suggests higher risk of continued decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) hiring Kim Vorrath to boost its AI capabilities and improve Siri is generally positive. Vorrath's extensive experience in software development, including her role in managing the original iPhone software and overseeing operating systems, is likely to enhance Apple's AI offerings. This move can help Apple catch up with its rivals in the AI space, such as OpenAI, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. While the company has faced some AI-related setbacks, the addition of a seasoned professional like Vorrath can be seen as a strategic step to strengthen its position. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, where the company is expected to post a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue and a rise in EPS. However, there are concerns about plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The article also mentions that investors will be looking for commentary on the Vision Pro headset and the company's product roadmap. Considering these factors, the stock price movement will likely depend on how the actual earnings report compares to the expected revenue and EPS. Given the mixed signals, with both positive and negative expectations, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, as the concerns about iPhone sales and regulatory pressures may outweigh the expected increase in revenue and EPS.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news describes a surge in US equity markets following President Trump's return to office, which includes positive mentions of FANG stocks (which would include Apple). The overall market positivity, combined with the mention of strong performance of both equities and tech stocks, suggests a likely positive sentiment towards Apple's stock. However, it is important to note that specific company performance can be influenced by a multitude of factors beyond general market trends.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is generating significant investor interest, which typically leads to volatility in stock prices. While there are positive expectations for Q1 earnings, concerns about slowing iPhone sales and regulatory pressures on services are present. The mixed signals from other tech companies and the broader market sentiment, influenced by Trump's policy agenda, add to the uncertainty. Given the historical performance of AAPL around earnings reports and the current mixed outlook, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but the overall sentiment remains cautious.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook. While Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, which is a positive catalyst, the forecast for the March quarter and fiscal years 2025/2026 is less optimistic due to projected iPhone sales decline. BofA's continued bullish stance and price target adjustment (albeit slightly downward) provide some support. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the expected positive Q1 earnings and BofA's bullishness, I'll lean slightly towards a rise, but temper it due to the negative forecasts and the downward price target adjustment. The previous round's predictions are quite varied, suggesting no clear consensus, so I'll weigh the positive and negative aspects of the news equally.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, significant concerns exist regarding slowing iPhone sales, regulatory pressures on services, and the uncertain market reception of the Vision Pro headset.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high indicates pre-existing bearish sentiment.  The earnings call will be crucial, focusing on iPhone sales, services growth, Vision Pro performance, and buyback announcements.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  The positive revenue and EPS projections suggest some upside potential, but the negative factors, particularly slowing iPhone sales and regulatory headwinds, are significant. Considering the overall uncertainty and the existing bearish sentiment, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than a price fall, although a significant drop isn't guaranteed. The macro environment adds further uncertainty.  I've weighted the previous predictions, giving more weight to models that considered the negative factors more heavily. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant underperformance in 2025, with an 11% slump, marking its worst start since 2008.

The company's stock price is down 14% from its 2024 high, indicating existing bearish sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and existing sentiment, the probability of a price rise is estimated to be lower than a price fall. However, the upcoming earnings call and potential positive commentary on the Vision Pro headset and product roadmap could influence investor reaction and lead to a price rise. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of decreasing optimism, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price fall due to technical indicators and negative sentiment. Taking into account the mixed signals, existing bearish sentiment, and the trend of decreasing optimism, the estimated probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in US equity markets as President Trump returned to office, suggesting a positive market sentiment. The article discusses the performance of FANG stocks, including Apple, in relation to broader market trends. Previous predictions vary widely, with some models indicating a positive outlook due to strong market performance and positive developments like hiring experienced professionals in AI.

The upcoming Q1 earnings are expected to be strong, which is a positive catalyst. However, the outlook for the March quarter and fiscal years 2025/2026 is less optimistic due to projected iPhone sales decline and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence. BofA's continued bullish stance, citing strong cash flow and potential product launches, provides some support, but they also slightly lowered their price target. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with a slight trend towards decreasing optimism. Given the expected positive Q1 earnings, I'll lean slightly towards a rise, but temper it due to the negative forecasts and the downward price target adjustment. The market's reaction to the earnings call will be crucial, especially regarding guidance for the March quarter and commentary on iPhone sales and Apple Intelligence adoption. The previous rounds show a slight decrease in optimism, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.
