(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What Analysts Expect from Apple's Q1 2025 Earnings Report\nNews Content: The release of Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) Fiscal First Quarter 2025 results is anticipated to draw market players' attention, with the global market conditions taking a toll on the sector. Apple is expected to post revenue of $124 billion this quarter, a nice 3% year-over-year increase. EPS is expected to rise from $1.47 in the previous quarter to $2.35.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with OONEF.\n\nTo a large extent, Apple's stock relies on the emergent performance of its core iPhone lineup, which brings in a large chunk of the company's revenue. Red flags are going up for analysts regarding iPhone sales volumes as signs of plateauing consumer demand emerge. Under its services segment, which includes the App Store and subscription offers, the company, too, is focusing on slower growth compared to its previous quarters on account of regulatory pressures.\n\nInvestors will look to hear commentary on the Vision Pro headset and its broader product roadmap to get a better-educated sense of whether Apple's innovation can sustain future growth. The report also is expected to feature heavily on share buybacks and capital returns to investors.\n\nApple Shares are down about 14% from their 2024 high, and the upcoming earnings call could set the stage for how Apple's stock moves in 2025. The key risks are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its earnings next week, which typically generates significant investor interest and can lead to volatility in the stock price. The overall market sentiment appears cautious due to mixed signals from other tech companies and external factors such as Trump's policy agenda. Given the historical performance of AAPL around earnings reports, there is a reasonable chance of a price rise if the results exceed expectations, but the uncertainty surrounding the broader market and potential negative sentiment could also lead to a price decline. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to reflect a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The immediate term (Q1 earnings) is expected to be positive, which typically drives the stock price up. However, the medium-term (March quarter and FY25/26) outlook is less optimistic due to projected iPhone sales decline and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence. BofA's continued bullish stance, citing strong cash flow and potential product launches, provides some counterweight to the negative forecasts. The price target adjustment, while slightly downward, still suggests upside potential. Considering these factors, the positive Q1 earnings are likely to have a stronger immediate impact than the longer-term concerns, but the negative forecasts will likely temper the rise. The price target adjustment also suggests a limited upside. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding slowing iPhone sales, regulatory pressures on services, and the uncertain success of the Vision Pro headset.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high indicates a bearish sentiment already present in the market.  The earnings call's commentary on these key areas (iPhone sales, services growth, Vision Pro, and buybacks) will heavily influence investor reaction.  Given the mixed signals and existing bearish sentiment, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, although a significant fall is not guaranteed. The macro environment also adds uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant underperformance in 2025, with an 11% slump, marking its worst start since 2008. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a key technical support level. Breaching this level could signal further downside, as noted by technical analysts. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical catalyst, but current sentiment leans negative due to the stock's recent performance and technical indicators. While there's potential for a rebound if earnings surprise positively, the immediate technical outlook suggests higher risk of continued decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) hiring Kim Vorrath to boost its AI capabilities and improve Siri is generally positive. Vorrath's extensive experience in software development, including her role in managing the original iPhone software and overseeing operating systems, is likely to enhance Apple's AI offerings. This move can help Apple catch up with its rivals in the AI space, such as OpenAI, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. While the company has faced some AI-related setbacks, the addition of a seasoned professional like Vorrath can be seen as a strategic step to strengthen its position. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, where the company is expected to post a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue and a rise in EPS. However, there are concerns about plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The article also mentions that investors will be looking for commentary on the Vision Pro headset and the company's product roadmap. Considering these factors, the stock price movement will likely depend on how the actual earnings report compares to the expected revenue and EPS. Given the mixed signals, with both positive and negative expectations, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, as the concerns about iPhone sales and regulatory pressures may outweigh the expected increase in revenue and EPS.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news describes a surge in US equity markets following President Trump's return to office, which includes positive mentions of FANG stocks (which would include Apple). The overall market positivity, combined with the mention of strong performance of both equities and tech stocks, suggests a likely positive sentiment towards Apple's stock. However, it is important to note that specific company performance can be influenced by a multitude of factors beyond general market trends.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
