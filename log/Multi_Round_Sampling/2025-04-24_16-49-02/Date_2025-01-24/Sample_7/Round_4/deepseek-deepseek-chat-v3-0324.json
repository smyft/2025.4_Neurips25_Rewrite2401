(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Thursday\u2019s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 4% to touch a fresh record high to start the year. Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its earnings next week, which typically generates significant investor interest and can lead to volatility in the stock price. The overall market sentiment appears cautious due to mixed signals from other tech companies and external factors such as Trump's policy agenda. Given the historical performance of AAPL around earnings reports, there is a reasonable chance of a price rise if the results exceed expectations, but the uncertainty surrounding the broader market and potential negative sentiment could also lead to a price decline. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to reflect a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The immediate term (Q1 earnings) is expected to be positive, which typically drives the stock price up. However, the medium-term (March quarter and FY25/26) outlook is less optimistic due to projected iPhone sales decline and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence. BofA's continued bullish stance, citing strong cash flow and potential product launches, provides some counterweight to the negative forecasts. The price target adjustment, while slightly downward, still suggests upside potential. Considering these factors, the positive Q1 earnings are likely to have a stronger immediate impact than the longer-term concerns, but the negative forecasts will likely temper the rise. The price target adjustment also suggests a limited upside. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding slowing iPhone sales, regulatory pressures on services, and the uncertain success of the Vision Pro headset.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high indicates a bearish sentiment already present in the market.  The earnings call's commentary on these key areas (iPhone sales, services growth, Vision Pro, and buybacks) will heavily influence investor reaction.  Given the mixed signals and existing bearish sentiment, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, although a significant fall is not guaranteed. The macro environment also adds uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant underperformance in 2025, with an 11% slump, marking its worst start since 2008. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a key technical support level. Breaching this level could signal further downside, as noted by technical analysts. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical catalyst, but current sentiment leans negative due to the stock's recent performance and technical indicators. While there's potential for a rebound if earnings surprise positively, the immediate technical outlook suggests higher risk of continued decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) hiring Kim Vorrath to boost its AI capabilities and improve Siri is generally positive. Vorrath's extensive experience in software development, including her role in managing the original iPhone software and overseeing operating systems, is likely to enhance Apple's AI offerings. This move can help Apple catch up with its rivals in the AI space, such as OpenAI, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. While the company has faced some AI-related setbacks, the addition of a seasoned professional like Vorrath can be seen as a strategic step to strengthen its position. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, where the company is expected to post a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue and a rise in EPS. However, there are concerns about plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The article also mentions that investors will be looking for commentary on the Vision Pro headset and the company's product roadmap. Considering these factors, the stock price movement will likely depend on how the actual earnings report compares to the expected revenue and EPS. Given the mixed signals, with both positive and negative expectations, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, as the concerns about iPhone sales and regulatory pressures may outweigh the expected increase in revenue and EPS.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news describes a surge in US equity markets following President Trump's return to office, which includes positive mentions of FANG stocks (which would include Apple). The overall market positivity, combined with the mention of strong performance of both equities and tech stocks, suggests a likely positive sentiment towards Apple's stock. However, it is important to note that specific company performance can be influenced by a multitude of factors beyond general market trends.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is generating significant investor interest, which typically leads to volatility in stock prices. While there are positive expectations for Q1 earnings, concerns about slowing iPhone sales and regulatory pressures on services are present. The mixed signals from other tech companies and the broader market sentiment, influenced by Trump's policy agenda, add to the uncertainty. Given the historical performance of AAPL around earnings reports and the current mixed outlook, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but the overall sentiment remains cautious.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook. While Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, which is a positive catalyst, the forecast for the March quarter and fiscal years 2025/2026 is less optimistic due to projected iPhone sales decline. BofA's continued bullish stance and price target adjustment (albeit slightly downward) provide some support. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the expected positive Q1 earnings and BofA's bullishness, I'll lean slightly towards a rise, but temper it due to the negative forecasts and the downward price target adjustment. The previous round's predictions are quite varied, suggesting no clear consensus, so I'll weigh the positive and negative aspects of the news equally.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, significant concerns exist regarding slowing iPhone sales, regulatory pressures on services, and the uncertain market reception of the Vision Pro headset.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high indicates pre-existing bearish sentiment.  The earnings call will be crucial, focusing on iPhone sales, services growth, Vision Pro performance, and buyback announcements.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  The positive revenue and EPS projections suggest some upside potential, but the negative factors, particularly slowing iPhone sales and regulatory headwinds, are significant. Considering the overall uncertainty and the existing bearish sentiment, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than a price fall, although a significant drop isn't guaranteed. The macro environment adds further uncertainty.  I've weighted the previous predictions, giving more weight to models that considered the negative factors more heavily. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant underperformance in 2025, with an 11% slump, marking its worst start since 2008.

The company's stock price is down 14% from its 2024 high, indicating existing bearish sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and existing sentiment, the probability of a price rise is estimated to be lower than a price fall. However, the upcoming earnings call and potential positive commentary on the Vision Pro headset and product roadmap could influence investor reaction and lead to a price rise. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of decreasing optimism, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price fall due to technical indicators and negative sentiment. Taking into account the mixed signals, existing bearish sentiment, and the trend of decreasing optimism, the estimated probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in US equity markets as President Trump returned to office, suggesting a positive market sentiment. The article discusses the performance of FANG stocks, including Apple, in relation to broader market trends. Previous predictions vary widely, with some models indicating a positive outlook due to strong market performance and positive developments like hiring experienced professionals in AI. However, concerns about iPhone sales, regulatory pressures on services, and the overall macroeconomic environment suggest some caution. The mixed signals from different predictions indicate a balanced view with a slight positive inclination.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc.

The upcoming Q1 earnings are expected to be strong, which is a positive catalyst. However, the outlook for the March quarter and fiscal years 2025/2026 is less optimistic due to projected iPhone sales decline and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence.

Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with a slight trend towards decreasing optimism. Given the expected positive Q1 earnings, I'll lean slightly towards a rise, but temper it due to the negative forecasts and the downward price target adjustment. The market's reaction to the earnings call will be crucial, especially regarding guidance for the March quarter and commentary on iPhone sales and Apple Intelligence adoption. The previous rounds show a slight decrease in optimism, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.
