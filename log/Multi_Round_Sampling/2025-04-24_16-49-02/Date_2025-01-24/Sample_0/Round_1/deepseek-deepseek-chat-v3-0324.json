(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nA warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.\n\n\"I think it depends on what stocks \u2014 yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,\" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become \"so expensive.\"\n\nIf the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.\n\n\"If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,\" Dalio said, adding, \"Rotation is the important consideration.\"\n\nDalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over the company's investment strategies.\n\nThe investment veteran, with an estimated net worth of $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet \u2014 if at all.There may not be much for stock investors to smile about if Ray Dalio's biggest concerns on US debt come true. The Bridgewater Associates founder (right) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two talked on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\u00b7Yahoo Finance\n\nIn an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation \u2014or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimping consumer purchasing power.\n\nMore recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called \"How Countries Go Broke.\"\n\nWorst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.\n\nRead more: Why TD Ameritrade's former CEO is bullish on the Trump trade\n\nInvestors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration, policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in top Mag Seven names like Nvidia.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nAnother bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini Elon Musk is our best chance in a lifetime at fixing government spending: Former Tesla exec Why you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\n\nStocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month.\n\nDalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,\" said Dalio.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. is expected to show a modest revenue increase of 3% year-over-year, which is positive. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures could weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the stock has already seen a significant decline of 14% from its 2024 high, indicating potential bearish sentiment. The focus on innovation and future product roadmaps will be crucial, but the overall market conditions and risks mentioned suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is taking steps to address its perceived shortcomings in AI, particularly with Siri. While the appointment of a veteran executive like Kim Vorrath signals a commitment to improvement and efficient execution, it also highlights existing concerns about Apple's AI capabilities relative to competitors. The article mentions past failures and delays, as well as criticisms of current AI offerings. The fact that Apple is bringing in someone known for 'fixing troubled products' suggests the situation is viewed internally as needing significant improvement. The negative aspects of the news (falling behind competitors, Siri's shortcomings, inaccurate AI-generated news) are balanced by the positive aspects (Vorrath's appointment, focus on improving AI infrastructure, planned Siri overhaul). Given the mixed signals, the impact on the stock price is likely to be moderate. The market may react positively to the commitment to AI, but concerns about Apple's current position could temper enthusiasm. I am giving a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, as the market generally reacts positively to news of companies addressing strategic weaknesses, especially in a key area like AI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating for Apple despite lowering its price target slightly from $256 to $253.  The lowered target reflects concerns about a weaker iPhone outlook, particularly in Q2 due to macroeconomic pressures and slower adoption of new features. However, the analysts highlight several positive factors: strong expected Q1 earnings exceeding Wall Street estimates, resilient earnings overall, robust growth in the Services segment (especially the App Store), and potential margin improvements from an in-house 5G modem.  The analysts also downplay concerns about China and regulatory pressures. The net effect is a mixed outlook. While the Q2 iPhone forecast reduction is negative, the positive factors, particularly the strong Q1 expectations and the Services growth, suggest a more balanced picture than a purely negative one.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, but the difference is not significant due to the conflicting signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights concerns from billionaire investor Ray Dalio about the overvaluation of leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), part of the 'Magnificent Seven.' Dalio warns that rising interest rates could negatively impact these expensive stocks. Additionally, broader macroeconomic concerns such as the US debt situation, inflation, and potential policy uncertainties under the Trump administration add to the bearish sentiment. Given Dalio's influence and the weight of his warnings, the market may react negatively to this news, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and investor confidence might mitigate some of the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article indicates that despite a weaker iPhone outlook, BofA Securities remains bullish on Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to earnings resiliency and strong Services growth. The trimmed price target from $256 to $253 suggests a slightly cautious but overall positive stance. The expectations of strong fiscal Q1 revenue and iPhone shipments, along with a positive outlook on Services and potential easing of regulatory pressures, contribute to a favorable view. However, concerns about Q2 iPhone shipments and macro pressures could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive aspects seem to outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article features billionaire investor Ray Dalio warning that the world's biggest stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are expensive and inflated. Dalio expects the 10-year yield to continue rising, which could negatively impact top-momentum names like Apple. Additionally, Dalio's concerns about the US debt situation and the potential for stagflation or a major inflation outbreak could further contribute to a decline in stock prices. While Dalio's predictions have not always come to pass, his warnings about the market and economic conditions should not be ignored. Therefore, based on this news, the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses options trading strategies and mentions the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech stocks. The focus on large moves both up and down suggests volatility but does not provide specific guidance on any individual stock within the group. Since there's no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL), it's challenging to gauge specific impacts on its stock price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
