(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump targets DEI programs, but corporate resistance grows\nNews Content: Wealth anchor Brad Smith highlights President Trump\u2019s initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. with the commander-in-chief targeting key initiatives like racial bias training and nondiscriminatory hiring practices.\n\nCritics argue these programs come at a cost, while data from Citigroup shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020.\n\nDespite this, companies like Nasdaq (NDAQ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are standing firm on their DEI values. Costco (COST) shareholders recently voted to defend diversity policies, and Apple (AAPL) faces a similar vote in February.\n\nCatch Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman address this shift in Corporate America's policies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n04:21\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts are 'not the solution,' says Rep.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to the AI and Machine Learning Division suggests that Apple is prioritizing advancements in these critical areas, which could enhance its competitive edge and innovation. This move may be perceived positively by investors, as it indicates a commitment to integrating AI into Apple's product ecosystem. However, the impact on stock price may be tempered by broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Overall, the news is likely to be viewed favorably, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades, declining iPhone market share in China, and a perceived lack of AI innovation are significant concerns. The article highlights that Apple's stock has already been under pressure. While past earnings reports have shown some positive surprises, the current negative sentiment and specific challenges outweigh the general market optimism. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses allegations of price discrimination by ride-hailing companies Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system (Android vs. iOS).  Apple is mentioned only indirectly as some users reported higher fares when using iPhones.  Ola's denial of using phone model-based pricing is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. The news does not contain any information directly impacting Apple's financials, products, or operations. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which has sparked corporate resistance, including from companies like Apple. While the political climate may create uncertainty, Apple's firm stance on DEI values aligns with broader corporate trends and shareholder sentiments, as seen with Costco's recent vote. This could be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility. However, the potential for regulatory changes and political backlash introduces some risk. Overall, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive, given its strong brand and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has reassigned executive Kim Vorrath to its AI and Machine Learning division. Vorrath is known for managing complex products, which suggests that Apple is strengthening its capabilities in AI and Machine Learning by moving a veteran executive to lead or support these efforts. This move is generally perceived as positive, as it indicates Apple's continued investment in emerging technologies that are likely to drive future growth. However, the impact on the stock price may be limited as the move is more strategic and less of a direct financial performance indicator. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or business operations. It discusses allegations of differential pricing by ride-hailing firms Ola and Uber based on phone models, with no direct implication on Apple's stock price. The article does mention Apple phones in the context of the allegations, but there is no indication that Apple is involved in or responsible for the pricing practices of Ola or Uber. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including beating Wall Street expectations and positive developments in integrating AI into their products. The company is also ranked first among stocks predicted by ChatGPT to be wealth-generating over the next 10 years. While there are concerns about potential tariffs and geopolitical tensions, the overall outlook remains positive with a bullish consensus from Wall Street analysts.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
