(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is Apple (AAPL) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among The Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned Apple widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nOn October 31, the company announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, beating Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. It posted a quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue, registered a 6% growth in revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest iPhone device, launched on September 20, gave Apple only a week of sales ahead of the earnings call. Despite that, the tech giant had a record business performance during the month, driving nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow. This allowed the company to return over $29 billion to shareholders for Q4 in dividends and repurchases.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a consensus Buy rating and average share price upside potential of 8%.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to the AI and Machine Learning Division suggests that Apple is prioritizing advancements in these critical areas, which could enhance its competitive edge and innovation. This move may be perceived positively by investors, as it indicates a commitment to integrating AI into Apple's product ecosystem. However, the impact on stock price may be tempered by broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Overall, the news is likely to be viewed favorably, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades, declining iPhone market share in China, and a perceived lack of AI innovation are significant concerns. The article highlights that Apple's stock has already been under pressure. While past earnings reports have shown some positive surprises, the current negative sentiment and specific challenges outweigh the general market optimism. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses allegations of price discrimination by ride-hailing companies Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system (Android vs. iOS).  Apple is mentioned only indirectly as some users reported higher fares when using iPhones.  Ola's denial of using phone model-based pricing is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. The news does not contain any information directly impacting Apple's financials, products, or operations. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which has sparked corporate resistance, including from companies like Apple. While the political climate may create uncertainty, Apple's firm stance on DEI values aligns with broader corporate trends and shareholder sentiments, as seen with Costco's recent vote. This could be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility. However, the potential for regulatory changes and political backlash introduces some risk. Overall, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive, given its strong brand and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has reassigned executive Kim Vorrath to its AI and Machine Learning division. Vorrath is known for managing complex products, which suggests that Apple is strengthening its capabilities in AI and Machine Learning by moving a veteran executive to lead or support these efforts. This move is generally perceived as positive, as it indicates Apple's continued investment in emerging technologies that are likely to drive future growth. However, the impact on the stock price may be limited as the move is more strategic and less of a direct financial performance indicator. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or business operations. It discusses allegations of differential pricing by ride-hailing firms Ola and Uber based on phone models, with no direct implication on Apple's stock price. The article does mention Apple phones in the context of the allegations, but there is no indication that Apple is involved in or responsible for the pricing practices of Ola or Uber. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including beating Wall Street expectations and positive developments in integrating AI into their products. The company is also ranked first among stocks predicted by ChatGPT to be wealth-generating over the next 10 years. While there are concerns about potential tariffs and geopolitical tensions, the overall outlook remains positive with a bullish consensus from Wall Street analysts.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to the AI and Machine Learning Division suggests that Apple is focusing on enhancing its capabilities in these critical areas, which could be viewed positively by investors. This move indicates a commitment to innovation and staying competitive in the tech landscape. While there are broader market concerns and some negative sentiment surrounding Apple, the specific news about Vorrath's reassignment is likely to be interpreted as a strategic positive. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the 'Magnificent 7' are generally expected to perform well, Apple specifically faces challenges. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI innovation are significant concerns. The article highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China. However, Apple's past earnings reports have shown positive surprises. Considering the negative sentiment and specific challenges, but also the potential for Apple to outperform expectations, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. The previous round of predictions were mixed, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall, indicating uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news article focuses on allegations of price discrimination by ride-hailing services Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system.  Apple is only indirectly mentioned as some users reported higher fares on iPhones.  Ola's denial of using phone model-based pricing is irrelevant to Apple's stock performance. The news lacks any direct impact on Apple's financials, products, or operations.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement due to this news is extremely low.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely and are based on various other factors unrelated to this specific news, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly leaning towards no change, reflecting the insignificance of this news to Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which has sparked corporate resistance, including from companies like Apple. Apple's firm stance on DEI values aligns with broader corporate trends and shareholder sentiments, as seen with Costco's recent vote. This could be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility. However, the potential for regulatory changes and political backlash introduces some risk. The previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong brand and market position, while others are more neutral or negative due to broader market concerns.

Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses allegations of differential pricing by ride-hailing firms Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system (Android vs. iOS). Apple is mentioned only indirectly as some users reported higher fares when using iPhones. However, both Ola and Uber have denied implementing phone model-based pricing, which suggests that the issue may not be directly related to Apple's business practices or financial performance. Considering the indirect impact and lack of direct involvement of Apple in the pricing practices of Ola and Uber, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The previous predictions from other models show a wide range of opinions, but most of them agree that the news has little to no direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate a low probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including beating Wall Street expectations and positive developments in integrating AI into their products.

Several analysts have downgraded the stock due to disappointing iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI innovation. The article also highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China. These are significant negative factors. However, Apple has a history of positive earnings surprises, and the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts). Considering the specific negative news about Apple, the analyst downgrades, and the market share decline, but also the potential for Apple to outperform expectations and the positive broader market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. The previous rounds of predictions were mixed, with a slight trend towards a more negative outlook in the most recent round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news about Ola and Uber's pricing practices in India is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  While Apple iPhones are mentioned in the context of user complaints, the news focuses on the ride-hailing companies' denials of discriminatory pricing. There's no direct link to Apple's financials, products, or operations.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, mostly due to other factors affecting Apple's stock.  Considering the lack of direct impact from this specific news, and the overall mixed sentiment from previous predictions based on other news, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change in Apple's stock price.  The slight lean towards no change reflects the insignificance of this news compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the corporate resistance it has sparked, including from Apple. Apple's stance on maintaining DEI values aligns with broader corporate trends and shareholder sentiments, as evidenced by Costco's recent vote. This could be viewed positively by investors who prioritize corporate social responsibility, potentially boosting Apple's stock price. However, the political uncertainty and potential regulatory changes introduce some risk. Previous predictions from various models show a mix of opinions, ranging from positive to neutral or slightly negative, but the majority lean towards a neutral to slightly positive impact due to Apple's strong brand and market position. Considering Apple's firm stance on DEI and the overall positive corporate resistance trend, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's reassignment of veteran executive Kim Vorrath to its AI and Machine Learning division.

The reassignment suggests a commitment to integrating AI into Apple's product ecosystem, which could enhance its competitive edge. However, the impact on the stock price may be tempered by broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Given the positive strategic implications of this move, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses allegations of differential pricing by ride-hailing firms Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system (Android vs. iOS).

While there are broader market concerns and some negative sentiment surrounding Apple, the specific news about Vorrath's reassignment is likely to be interpreted as a strategic positive. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, but the overall sentiment leans towards a favorable outlook due to the emphasis on AI and Machine Learning, which are crucial for future growth.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but largely negative outlook for Apple. While the 'Magnificent 7' are generally expected to perform well, Apple specifically faces challenges. Several analysts have downgraded the stock due to disappointing iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI innovation. The article also highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China, which is a significant negative factor. The company's market valuation has declined, and Nvidia has overtaken it as the world's most valuable company. While Apple has a history of positive earnings surprises, the specific negative news about Apple, the analyst downgrades, and the market share decline outweigh the potential for positive surprises. The previous rounds of predictions were mixed, with a trend towards a more negative outlook in the most recent round. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news about Ola and Uber's pricing practices in India is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, mostly due to other factors affecting Apple's stock (AI investments, market share, analyst downgrades, broader market sentiment, etc.).  This news item provides no significant new information to alter the existing sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement due to this news is extremely low.  I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change, reflecting the insignificance of this news compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock performance.  The slight lean towards no change acknowledges the persistent, albeit varied, predictions from other models based on other news and factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the corporate resistance it has sparked, including from Apple.
