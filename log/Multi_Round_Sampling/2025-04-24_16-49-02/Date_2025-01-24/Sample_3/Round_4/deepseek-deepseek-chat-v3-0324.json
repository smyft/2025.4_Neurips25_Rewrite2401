(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump targets DEI programs, but corporate resistance grows\nNews Content: Wealth anchor Brad Smith highlights President Trump\u2019s initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. with the commander-in-chief targeting key initiatives like racial bias training and nondiscriminatory hiring practices.\n\nCritics argue these programs come at a cost, while data from Citigroup shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020.\n\nDespite this, companies like Nasdaq (NDAQ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are standing firm on their DEI values. Costco (COST) shareholders recently voted to defend diversity policies, and Apple (AAPL) faces a similar vote in February.\n\nCatch Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman address this shift in Corporate America's policies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n04:21\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts are 'not the solution,' says Rep.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to the AI and Machine Learning Division suggests that Apple is prioritizing advancements in these critical areas, which could enhance its competitive edge and innovation. This move may be perceived positively by investors, as it indicates a commitment to integrating AI into Apple's product ecosystem. However, the impact on stock price may be tempered by broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Overall, the news is likely to be viewed favorably, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades, declining iPhone market share in China, and a perceived lack of AI innovation are significant concerns. The article highlights that Apple's stock has already been under pressure. While past earnings reports have shown some positive surprises, the current negative sentiment and specific challenges outweigh the general market optimism. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses allegations of price discrimination by ride-hailing companies Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system (Android vs. iOS).  Apple is mentioned only indirectly as some users reported higher fares when using iPhones.  Ola's denial of using phone model-based pricing is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. The news does not contain any information directly impacting Apple's financials, products, or operations. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which has sparked corporate resistance, including from companies like Apple. While the political climate may create uncertainty, Apple's firm stance on DEI values aligns with broader corporate trends and shareholder sentiments, as seen with Costco's recent vote. This could be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility. However, the potential for regulatory changes and political backlash introduces some risk. Overall, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive, given its strong brand and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has reassigned executive Kim Vorrath to its AI and Machine Learning division. Vorrath is known for managing complex products, which suggests that Apple is strengthening its capabilities in AI and Machine Learning by moving a veteran executive to lead or support these efforts. This move is generally perceived as positive, as it indicates Apple's continued investment in emerging technologies that are likely to drive future growth. However, the impact on the stock price may be limited as the move is more strategic and less of a direct financial performance indicator. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or business operations. It discusses allegations of differential pricing by ride-hailing firms Ola and Uber based on phone models, with no direct implication on Apple's stock price. The article does mention Apple phones in the context of the allegations, but there is no indication that Apple is involved in or responsible for the pricing practices of Ola or Uber. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including beating Wall Street expectations and positive developments in integrating AI into their products. The company is also ranked first among stocks predicted by ChatGPT to be wealth-generating over the next 10 years. While there are concerns about potential tariffs and geopolitical tensions, the overall outlook remains positive with a bullish consensus from Wall Street analysts.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to the AI and Machine Learning Division suggests that Apple is focusing on enhancing its capabilities in these critical areas, which could be viewed positively by investors. This move indicates a commitment to innovation and staying competitive in the tech landscape. While there are broader market concerns and some negative sentiment surrounding Apple, the specific news about Vorrath's reassignment is likely to be interpreted as a strategic positive. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the 'Magnificent 7' are generally expected to perform well, Apple specifically faces challenges. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI innovation are significant concerns. The article highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China. However, Apple's past earnings reports have shown positive surprises. Considering the negative sentiment and specific challenges, but also the potential for Apple to outperform expectations, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. The previous round of predictions were mixed, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall, indicating uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news article focuses on allegations of price discrimination by ride-hailing services Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system.  Apple is only indirectly mentioned as some users reported higher fares on iPhones.  Ola's denial of using phone model-based pricing is irrelevant to Apple's stock performance. The news lacks any direct impact on Apple's financials, products, or operations.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement due to this news is extremely low.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely and are based on various other factors unrelated to this specific news, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly leaning towards no change, reflecting the insignificance of this news to Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which has sparked corporate resistance, including from companies like Apple.

Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses allegations of differential pricing by ride-hailing firms Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system (Android vs. iOS). Apple is mentioned only indirectly as some users reported higher fares when using iPhones. However, both Ola and Uber have denied implementing phone model-based pricing, which suggests that the issue may not be directly related to Apple's business practices or financial performance. Considering the indirect impact and lack of direct involvement of Apple in the pricing practices of Ola and Uber, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The previous predictions from other models show a wide range of opinions, but most of them agree that the news has little to no direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate a low probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including beating Wall Street expectations and positive developments in integrating AI into their products.

Several analysts have downgraded the stock due to disappointing iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI innovation. The article also highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China. These are significant negative factors. However, Apple has a history of positive earnings surprises, and the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts). Considering the specific negative news about Apple, the analyst downgrades, and the market share decline, but also the potential for Apple to outperform expectations and the positive broader market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. The previous rounds of predictions were mixed, with a slight trend towards a more negative outlook in the most recent round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news about Ola and Uber's pricing practices in India is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  While Apple iPhones are mentioned in the context of user complaints, the news focuses on the ride-hailing companies' denials of discriminatory pricing. There's no direct link to Apple's financials, products, or operations.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, mostly due to other factors affecting Apple's stock.  Considering the lack of direct impact from this specific news, and the overall mixed sentiment from previous predictions based on other news, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change in Apple's stock price.  The slight lean towards no change reflects the insignificance of this news compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the corporate resistance it has sparked, including from Apple. Apple's stance on maintaining DEI values aligns with broader corporate trends and shareholder sentiments, as evidenced by Costco's recent vote. This could be viewed positively by investors who prioritize corporate social responsibility, potentially boosting Apple's stock price. However, the political uncertainty and potential regulatory changes introduce some risk. Previous predictions from various models show a mix of opinions, ranging from positive to neutral or slightly negative, but the majority lean towards a neutral to slightly positive impact due to Apple's strong brand and market position.

The reassignment suggests a commitment to integrating AI into Apple's product ecosystem, which could enhance its competitive edge.

While there are broader market concerns and some negative sentiment surrounding Apple, the specific news about Vorrath's reassignment is likely to be interpreted as a strategic positive.

While the 'Magnificent 7' are generally expected to perform well, Apple specifically faces challenges. Several analysts have downgraded the stock due to disappointing iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI innovation. The article also highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China, which is a significant negative factor. The company's market valuation has declined, and Nvidia has overtaken it as the world's most valuable company. While Apple has a history of positive earnings surprises, the specific negative news about Apple, the analyst downgrades, and the market share decline outweigh the potential for positive surprises. The previous rounds of predictions were mixed, with a trend towards a more negative outlook in the most recent round.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, mostly due to other factors affecting Apple's stock (AI investments, market share, analyst downgrades, broader market sentiment, etc.).

I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change, reflecting the insignificance of this news compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock performance.  The slight lean towards no change acknowledges the persistent, albeit varied, predictions from other models based on other news and factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the corporate resistance it has sparked, including from Apple.
