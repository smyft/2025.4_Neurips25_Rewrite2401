(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple\u2019s iPhone which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas.

The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing strong financial performance, a bullish consensus from analysts, and the integration of AI into its products, which is expected to drive growth. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the tech sector. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is high, while the potential for a decline is mitigated by the strong fundamentals and positive market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, as evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) being in the red. This suggests a negative sentiment towards tech stocks overall. While Apple is a strong company, it is not immune to broader market trends. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise. The lack of specific information about Apple's performance makes it difficult to give a more precise estimate, but the general sector weakness is a significant factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has moved a veteran executive known for managing complex products to its AI and machine learning division.  This is generally considered positive news.  While we don't have the full context of the article, the move suggests Apple is prioritizing AI/ML and investing in its development.  This could be seen as a positive sign for future innovation and potentially increased revenue streams. However, the impact on the stock price is likely to be relatively small, as this is one personnel move among many factors influencing Apple's stock.  The lack of detail in the available headline makes it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a rise, reflecting the generally positive nature of the news, but remain close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI capabilities by appointing Kim Vorrath, a seasoned executive with extensive experience in key Apple products, to lead AI and machine learning efforts, particularly focusing on Siri. This signals Apple's commitment to addressing its AI setbacks and competing more effectively with rivals like OpenAI, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The market may view this positively as it demonstrates proactive steps to improve AI offerings, which could enhance future revenue streams and product competitiveness. However, the acknowledgment of recent AI setbacks and delays (e.g., ChatGPT integration) might temper some optimism. Overall, the positive sentiment around Vorrath's appointment and Apple's focus on AI likely outweighs the negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its potential for growth, highlighting its record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, with a 6% rise from the previous year. The company's strong performance in its services sector, with over 1 billion paid memberships and a record high of $25 billion in services revenue, indicates a positive outlook. Additionally, Apple's solid position in the consumer electronics sector with its high-end ecosystem of goods and services contributes to its potential for growth. However, the article also mentions that AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Based on this information, we can infer that Apple's stock price has a positive outlook but might not be as high as other AI-related stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position among the best Dow stocks to buy right now, highlighting its solid financial performance, dominance in the consumer electronics sector, and growth in services revenue. However, the article also mentions that the company ranks 5th on the list, with the author's conviction lying in AI stocks holding greater promise for delivering higher returns. The overall tone of the article is neutral, providing both positive and negative perspectives on Apple's potential. Given this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, due to Apple's strong brand and financials, but also considering the potential impact of AI stocks on the market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including beating Wall Street expectations and positive developments in integrating AI into their products. The company is also ranked first among stocks predicted by ChatGPT to be wealth-generating over the next decade. While there are concerns about potential tariffs under a new administration, the overall outlook remains positive with strong analyst support and a high number of hedge fund holders.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
