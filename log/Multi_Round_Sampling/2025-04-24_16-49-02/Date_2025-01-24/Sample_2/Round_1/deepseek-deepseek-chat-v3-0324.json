A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to post strong Q1 earnings, which is a positive signal for investors. However, there are concerns about declining iPhone sales in the upcoming quarters, which could negatively impact future earnings. Despite the lowered sales forecasts, BofA remains bullish on the stock due to strong cash flow and potential product launches. The mixed signals suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise due to the strong earnings outlook, but the concerns about future sales could lead to some downward pressure. Overall, the positive earnings expectation outweighs the negative sales forecast, leading to a higher probability of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple (AAPL) is releasing earnings next week, attracting investor attention. While the article doesn't provide specific details about Apple's expected performance, the general market sentiment towards the 'Magnificent 7' is positive. However, without specific guidance or analyst expectations for Apple's earnings, it's difficult to definitively predict the stock's movement. Given the overall positive sentiment towards tech earnings and Apple's historical performance, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the uncertainty with a significant probability of a price fall as well.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses allegations of price discrimination by ride-hailing companies Ola and Uber in India, based on the user's phone operating system (Android vs. iOS).  Apple is mentioned only indirectly as some users reported higher fares when using iPhones.  Ola's denial of using phone model-based pricing is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. The news does not contain any information directly impacting Apple's financials, products, or operations. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has reassigned a veteran executive, Kim Vorrath, to the AI and Machine Learning division. This move suggests a strategic focus on AI and machine learning, which are key growth areas in the tech industry. Such a reassignment could be interpreted positively by investors, as it may signal Apple's commitment to innovation and staying competitive in AI. However, the impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be moderate, as the reassignment of a single executive, while notable, does not constitute a major business development. The market's reaction will depend on broader investor sentiment and other concurrent factors affecting Apple's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is bringing Kim Vorrath on board to tackle AI challenges and boost Siri, indicating a strategic move to enhance its AI capabilities. Vorrath's extensive experience, including her role in managing the original iPhone software and overseeing operating systems for various Apple devices, could help the company overcome its recent AI setbacks and improve its competitive position. However, the impact of this move on the stock price is uncertain and may be limited in the short term. The company's recent AI-related missteps and efforts to catch up with rivals like OpenAI, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft could be viewed positively if investors believe Vorrath's appointment will drive significant improvements. Nevertheless, given that the news does not provide immediate financial results or revolutionary product announcements, its impact might be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating, citing earnings resiliency and a strong fiscal Q1 with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments. Additionally, the Services segment is expected to grow 13% in Q1 and 14% for the rest of the year, with App Store revenue increasing 15% year-over-year. However, concerns about iPhone sales in Q2, with a lowered forecast of 49 million units, and macro pressures may negatively impact the stock price. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is slightly positive, but cautious.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong financial performance and its position as one of the best Dow stocks to buy right now. However, the article suggests that AI stocks may hold greater promise for higher returns in the near future. This could slightly diminish the attractiveness of Apple in comparison to pure-play AI stocks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
