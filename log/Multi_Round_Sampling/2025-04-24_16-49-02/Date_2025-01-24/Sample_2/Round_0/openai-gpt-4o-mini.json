(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Faces Challenges in 2025, but Q1 Earnings Likely to Beat Estimates\nNews Content: On January 30, Apple (AAPL, Financial) is set to post strongly ahead of the iPhone 16 on a fiscal first quarter of fiscal year 2025 earnings call. BofA analysts continue to see strong Q1 results but warn that the March quarter will be weak, with iPhone sales likely to decline to 49 million units versus the consensus of 52 million. Macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features are to blame for the decline.\n\nBofA cut its iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 to 229 million for 2025 and 246 million for 2026 from 262 million each. However, the bank is still bullish on the stock, noting Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency and its possible pending product launches, including the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. BofA says concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are overdone, given that it has cut prices and will receive potential government subsidies. Analysts adjust the price target for Apple to $253 from $256 as the company's new FY26 EPS forecast of $8.37 yields a 30x multiple.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The mixed signals suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise due to the strong earnings outlook, but the concerns about future sales could lead to some downward pressure.
