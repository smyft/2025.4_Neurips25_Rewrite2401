A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during Trump's first week back in office. This generally bodes well for major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as they are often seen as leaders in the market. The comparison of FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks suggests a favorable environment for tech companies. Given the overall bullish sentiment and the historical performance of tech stocks during similar market conditions, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI interest are significant concerns. The loss of market share in China to Huawei is also a negative factor. While the company beat expectations in the fourth quarter, the current sentiment and near-term outlook are bearish. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on several companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly provide positive or negative news specifically about Apple's upcoming earnings report, the overall market sentiment is mixed.  The mention of Trump's return to office and potential policy changes introduces uncertainty.  The chip sector news (ASML and Intel) is mixed, with ASML facing challenges and Intel undergoing a CEO transition.  The luxury sector shows some positive signs, but this is not directly related to Apple.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to *this specific news article* is relatively low.  The probability is more likely to be influenced by the actual earnings report itself, which is not covered in this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to be affected by broader sector trends. Given the negative sentiment and downward movement in the tech sector, it is reasonable to infer that AAPL's stock price may also experience downward pressure. However, without specific details about AAPL's performance or additional context from the premium article, the analysis is limited to the general sector trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses five stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), in a Q&A session on the Zacks Market Edge Podcast. For Apple, the article mentions that the stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Additionally, it notes that Apple's forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article poses a question about whether Apple would be a buying opportunity if it falls further. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but it does not provide a direct recommendation to buy or sell. Given the current performance and valuation, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is making significant efforts to improve its AI and Siri technologies by appointing a seasoned executive, Kim Vorrath, to lead these initiatives. This suggests that Apple is committed to addressing its perceived weaknesses in AI, which could potentially enhance its competitive position in the tech industry. However, the immediate impact on the stock price might be limited given the long-term nature of these improvements.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during Trump's first week back in office, which generally bodes well for major tech stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there are mixed signals regarding Apple's specific performance, including concerns about iPhone sales and competition from Huawei. The overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, but the negative factors specific to Apple temper this optimism. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by significant concerns that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI interest are significant concerns. The loss of market share in China to Huawei is also a negative factor. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of negative sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is largely focused on other companies' earnings reports and broader market trends, offering little specific information about Apple's upcoming earnings or prospects.  While the overall market sentiment is mixed (positive due to Trump's return, but negative in some sectors like chips and luxury goods), this is not directly indicative of Apple's performance.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's short-term movement.  The lack of specific Apple-related news in this article suggests that the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) solely due to this news is low.  The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of price changes next week. Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downtrend in tech stocks, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). This suggests a broader negative sentiment affecting the tech sector, likely impacting AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of positive catalysts or company-specific news in the headline, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling, aligning with the negative sector trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's stock performance and mentions that it has declined 11.3% year-to-date with a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article poses a question about whether Apple would be a buying opportunity if it falls further. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but it does not provide a direct recommendation to buy or sell. Given the current performance and valuation, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising. However, considering the general market sentiment and the fact that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock, there is still a possibility for the stock price to rise if it attracts buyers at lower levels.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, as well as the mixed predictions from other models, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a seasoned executive known for her ability to manage complex software projects and improve product development, to oversee AI and Siri enhancements at Apple indicates a strategic focus on improving core competencies in artificial intelligence. This news reflects Apple's commitment to catching up with leading tech companies in AI and enhancing its product offerings. Such strategic moves typically instill investor confidence, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's future performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
