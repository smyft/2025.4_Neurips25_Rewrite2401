(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during Trump's first week back in office. This generally bodes well for major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as they are often seen as leaders in the market. The comparison of FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks suggests a favorable environment for tech companies. Given the overall bullish sentiment and the historical performance of tech stocks during similar market conditions, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI interest are significant concerns. The loss of market share in China to Huawei is also a negative factor. While the company beat expectations in the fourth quarter, the current sentiment and near-term outlook are bearish. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on several companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly provide positive or negative news specifically about Apple's upcoming earnings report, the overall market sentiment is mixed.  The mention of Trump's return to office and potential policy changes introduces uncertainty.  The chip sector news (ASML and Intel) is mixed, with ASML facing challenges and Intel undergoing a CEO transition.  The luxury sector shows some positive signs, but this is not directly related to Apple.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to *this specific news article* is relatively low.  The probability is more likely to be influenced by the actual earnings report itself, which is not covered in this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to be affected by broader sector trends. Given the negative sentiment and downward movement in the tech sector, it is reasonable to infer that AAPL's stock price may also experience downward pressure. However, without specific details about AAPL's performance or additional context from the premium article, the analysis is limited to the general sector trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses five stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), in a Q&A session on the Zacks Market Edge Podcast. For Apple, the article mentions that the stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Additionally, it notes that Apple's forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article poses a question about whether Apple would be a buying opportunity if it falls further. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but it does not provide a direct recommendation to buy or sell. Given the current performance and valuation, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is making significant efforts to improve its AI and Siri technologies by appointing a seasoned executive, Kim Vorrath, to lead these initiatives. This suggests that Apple is committed to addressing its perceived weaknesses in AI, which could potentially enhance its competitive position in the tech industry. However, the immediate impact on the stock price might be limited given the long-term nature of these improvements.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during Trump's first week back in office, which generally bodes well for major tech stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there are mixed signals regarding Apple's specific performance, including concerns about iPhone sales and competition from Huawei. The overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, but the negative factors specific to Apple temper this optimism. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by significant concerns that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI interest are significant concerns. The loss of market share in China to Huawei is also a negative factor. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of negative sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is largely focused on other companies' earnings reports and broader market trends, offering little specific information about Apple's upcoming earnings or prospects.  While the overall market sentiment is mixed (positive due to Trump's return, but negative in some sectors like chips and luxury goods), this is not directly indicative of Apple's performance.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's short-term movement.  The lack of specific Apple-related news in this article suggests that the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) solely due to this news is low.  The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of price changes next week. Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downtrend in tech stocks, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). This suggests a broader negative sentiment affecting the tech sector, likely impacting AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of positive catalysts or company-specific news in the headline, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling, aligning with the negative sector trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's stock performance and mentions that it has declined 11.3% year-to-date with a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article poses a question about whether Apple would be a buying opportunity if it falls further. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but it does not provide a direct recommendation to buy or sell. Given the current performance and valuation, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising. However, considering the general market sentiment and the fact that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock, there is still a possibility for the stock price to rise if it attracts buyers at lower levels.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, as well as the mixed predictions from other models, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a seasoned executive known for her ability to manage complex software projects and improve product development, to oversee AI and Siri enhancements at Apple indicates a strategic focus on improving core competencies in artificial intelligence. This news reflects Apple's commitment to catching up with leading tech companies in AI and enhancing its product offerings. Such strategic moves typically instill investor confidence, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's future performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
