(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Thursday\u2019s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 4% to touch a fresh record high to start the year. Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during Trump's first week back in office. This generally bodes well for major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as they are often seen as leaders in the market. The comparison of FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks suggests a favorable environment for tech companies. Given the overall bullish sentiment and the historical performance of tech stocks during similar market conditions, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI interest are significant concerns. The loss of market share in China to Huawei is also a negative factor. While the company beat expectations in the fourth quarter, the current sentiment and near-term outlook are bearish. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on several companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly provide positive or negative news specifically about Apple's upcoming earnings report, the overall market sentiment is mixed.  The mention of Trump's return to office and potential policy changes introduces uncertainty.  The chip sector news (ASML and Intel) is mixed, with ASML facing challenges and Intel undergoing a CEO transition.  The luxury sector shows some positive signs, but this is not directly related to Apple.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to *this specific news article* is relatively low.  The probability is more likely to be influenced by the actual earnings report itself, which is not covered in this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to be affected by broader sector trends. Given the negative sentiment and downward movement in the tech sector, it is reasonable to infer that AAPL's stock price may also experience downward pressure. However, without specific details about AAPL's performance or additional context from the premium article, the analysis is limited to the general sector trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses five stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), in a Q&A session on the Zacks Market Edge Podcast. For Apple, the article mentions that the stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Additionally, it notes that Apple's forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article poses a question about whether Apple would be a buying opportunity if it falls further. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but it does not provide a direct recommendation to buy or sell. Given the current performance and valuation, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is making significant efforts to improve its AI and Siri technologies by appointing a seasoned executive, Kim Vorrath, to lead these initiatives. This suggests that Apple is committed to addressing its perceived weaknesses in AI, which could potentially enhance its competitive position in the tech industry. However, the immediate impact on the stock price might be limited given the long-term nature of these improvements.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during Trump's first week back in office, which generally bodes well for major tech stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there are mixed signals regarding Apple's specific performance, including concerns about iPhone sales and competition from Huawei. The overall bullish sentiment in the market suggests a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, but the negative factors specific to Apple temper this optimism. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by significant concerns that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader market sentiment is positive due to the 'Magnificent 7' and potential benefits from a Trump presidency (AI investments, deregulation, tax cuts), Apple specifically faces headwinds. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a perceived lack of AI interest are significant concerns. The loss of market share in China to Huawei is also a negative factor. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of negative sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is largely focused on other companies' earnings reports and broader market trends, offering little specific information about Apple's upcoming earnings or prospects.  While the overall market sentiment is mixed (positive due to Trump's return, but negative in some sectors like chips and luxury goods), this is not directly indicative of Apple's performance.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's short-term movement.  The lack of specific Apple-related news in this article suggests that the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) solely due to this news is low.  The actual earnings report will be the primary driver of price changes next week. Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downtrend in tech stocks, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). This suggests a broader negative sentiment affecting the tech sector, likely impacting AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of positive catalysts or company-specific news in the headline, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling, aligning with the negative sector trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's stock performance and mentions that it has declined 11.3% year-to-date with a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article poses a question about whether Apple would be a buying opportunity if it falls further. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but it does not provide a direct recommendation to buy or sell. Given the current performance and valuation, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising. However, considering the general market sentiment and the fact that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock, there is still a possibility for the stock price to rise if it attracts buyers at lower levels.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further downside if breached. Analysts predict further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on technical analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Considering these factors, as well as the mixed predictions from other models, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a seasoned executive known for her ability to manage complex software projects and improve product development, to oversee AI and Siri enhancements at Apple indicates a strategic focus on improving core competencies in artificial intelligence. This news reflects Apple's commitment to catching up with leading tech companies in AI and enhancing its product offerings. Such strategic moves typically instill investor confidence, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's future performance.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during Trump's first week back in office, which generally bodes well for major tech stocks like Apple Inc.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of negative sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise. However, the fact that it is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and the overall market is bullish, it is unlikely to fall too much.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for the market and Apple specifically. While the return of President Trump and the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies ('Magnificent Seven') could create a generally positive market sentiment, there are several factors that could negatively impact Apple's stock price.  These include concerns about weakening iPhone sales, competition from Huawei, and the overall mixed performance of the chip sector (as indicated by ASML and Intel's situations).  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's short-term movement.  The article itself offers little specific information about Apple's upcoming earnings report, which will likely be the primary driver of price changes. Considering the mixed market sentiment, the lack of specific positive news for Apple, and the previous predictions leaning slightly towards a price fall, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise. However, the probability is not drastically skewed in either direction due to the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downtrend in tech stocks, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) which includes Apple Inc.

Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling, aligning with the negative sector trend. However, Apple's strategic moves, such as the appointment of Kim Vorrath to oversee AI and Siri enhancements, could instill some investor confidence. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses five stocks, including Apple Inc.

The trend of previous predictions also indicates a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has appointed Kim Vorrath, an experienced executive known for handling complex software projects, to lead AI and Siri improvements. This strategic move signals Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI capabilities, which could positively influence investor confidence. However, the previous predictions from various models suggest a mixture of positive and negative sentiments, with most leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns such as weak iPhone sales, competition from rivals, and high valuations. Taking into account the mixed signals and the positive nature of the news about AI improvements, the overall probability remains moderately positive.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during Trump's first week back in office, which generally bodes well for major tech stocks like Apple Inc.
