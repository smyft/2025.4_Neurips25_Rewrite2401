(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump targets DEI programs, but corporate resistance grows\nNews Content: Wealth anchor Brad Smith highlights President Trump\u2019s initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. with the commander-in-chief targeting key initiatives like racial bias training and nondiscriminatory hiring practices.\n\nCritics argue these programs come at a cost, while data from Citigroup shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020.\n\nDespite this, companies like Nasdaq (NDAQ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are standing firm on their DEI values. Costco (COST) shareholders recently voted to defend diversity policies, and Apple (AAPL) faces a similar vote in February.\n\nCatch Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman address this shift in Corporate America's policies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n04:21\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts are 'not the solution,' says Rep.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses options trading strategies for the Magnificent Seven, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus on options trading suggests that investors are anticipating volatility in the stock prices of these major tech companies. While the mention of large moves indicates potential for both upward and downward price movements, the overall sentiment around options trading often leans towards bullishness, especially in a strong tech sector. Therefore, while there is a significant chance of price fluctuations, the probability of a price rise is slightly favored due to the positive context of options trading strategies being discussed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses options trading strategies for the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple. It highlights the use of options to analyze potential price movements (both up and down) within a specific timeframe. The article doesn't provide any specific positive or negative information about Apple itself, but rather discusses general strategies. The mention of 'synthetic' long positions around Amazon suggests a potentially bullish strategy for that specific stock, but no such indication is given for Apple. Therefore, the news is neutral for Apple. The probabilities are set to reflect this neutrality.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses options trading strategies for the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of large-cap tech companies that includes Apple.  The expert, Jessica Inskip, mentions that options trading allows for analysis of potential price movements, indicating a range of deviation and expecting large moves, both up and down. However, the article provides no specific information about Apple's prospects or any factors that would suggest a higher probability of a price increase or decrease.  The discussion is general and focuses on options trading strategies rather than fundamental or technical analysis of Apple itself. Therefore, the news provides no basis to assign a probability higher than a neutral 50/50 chance for either a price rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late Friday afternoon. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector, it is likely to be affected by this broader market trend. Given the negative sentiment in the sector, there is a higher probability that AAPL's stock price will fall in the short term. However, without access to the full article, the analysis is limited to the headline's implication of sector-wide weakness.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which could potentially impact companies that have strong DEI values. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as facing a similar vote in February regarding its diversity policies. However, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the potential controversy and uncertainty surrounding DEI programs. The news does not provide any direct financial or product-related information about Apple, so the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by investors' reactions to the potential changes in regulations and corporate policies.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, which is expected to show a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue and a rise in EPS. However, there are concerns about plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The article also mentions that Apple's stock is down 14% from its 2024 high. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the concerns about demand and growth outweigh the expected increase in revenue and EPS.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been under pressure due to disappointing news around its iPhone market share and recent analyst downgrades. The company is expected to report weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter, particularly regarding iPhone sales and consumer interest in AI. These factors suggest a negative sentiment towards the stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses options trading strategies for the Magnificent Seven, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus on options trading suggests that investors are anticipating volatility in the stock prices of these major tech companies. While the mention of large moves indicates potential for both upward and downward price movements, the overall sentiment around options trading often leans towards bullishness, especially in a strong tech sector. However, previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards bearishness due to broader market trends and concerns about Apple's performance. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on options trading strategies for the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple. The expert highlights the use of options to analyze potential price movements (both up and down) within a specific timeframe. While the article doesn't provide specific positive or negative information about Apple itself, the discussion of options strategies suggests an expectation of volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models initially leaned towards neutral, while others predicted a fall based on broader market trends or concerns about Apple's performance. Given the focus on options and the mixed prior predictions, I'll slightly favor a neutral stance with a slight lean towards a potential rise, acknowledging the inherent volatility implied by options trading.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on options trading strategies for the 'Magnificent Seven', a group of large-cap tech companies including Apple.  The discussion centers on the potential for large price swings (both up and down) and utilizes options as a tool to analyze these potential movements.  The article itself provides no specific information about Apple's prospects or any factors that would suggest a higher probability of a price increase or decrease.  The overall sentiment is neutral.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly bullish and others slightly bearish, but none strongly supporting a directional move.  Given the lack of specific news about Apple and the neutral nature of the options trading discussion, a neutral probability is assigned, similar to several previous models.  The previous predictions show a wide range, indicating uncertainty in the market about Apple's near-term direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates a late afternoon decline in tech stocks, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a major component. Given that Apple is a significant player in the tech sector, this broader market trend suggests a negative short-term impact on AAPL's stock price. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with models citing sector-wide weakness, disappointing iPhone market share, and regulatory pressures as contributing factors. While some models initially provided neutral or slightly positive outlooks, the more recent predictions and the sector-wide downturn indicated by the news headline tilt the balance towards a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which could potentially impact companies that have strong DEI values, such as Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there is no direct financial or product-related information about Apple in the article. The mention of Apple's upcoming vote on diversity policies and its potential impact on corporate resistance to DEI programs may contribute to uncertainty but does not provide a clear direction for the stock price movement. Given that there is no specific positive or negative information about Apple's financials, products, or services in the article, and considering that Apple's stock has faced some pressure due to concerns about its iPhone market share and growth in the services segment, the news seems to be more neutral than directly impactful. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall should reflect a cautious or slightly negative view due to potential controversy and uncertainty surrounding DEI programs, but without a clear direction, it's reasonable to consider a slightly higher chance of a stock price decrease given the overall market and sector trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, which is expected to show a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue and a rise in EPS. However, there are concerns about plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The article also mentions that Apple's stock is down 14% from its 2024 high. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the concerns about demand and growth outweigh the expected increase in revenue and EPS. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a trend of decreasing probability of stock price rise, with some models assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling due to negative sentiment and concerns about the company's performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple Inc., including declining iPhone market share, analyst downgrades, and reduced expectations for its earnings report. The recent drop in market valuation and the company losing its top spot in smartphone sales further exacerbates negative sentiment. Despite the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector due to the 'Stargate' project, Apple's specific issues outweigh these positives.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
