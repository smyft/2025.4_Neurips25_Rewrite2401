Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of Apple Inc. While the company is the largest in the world with strong revenue and profitability, concerns about its high valuation metrics and lack of recent revolutionary products may lead to cautious investor sentiment. The potential for a stock price rise is supported by ongoing investments in AI and a history of strong performance, but the overvaluation and market corrections could lead to a price decline. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution regarding Apple's stock in 2025 despite its current status as the largest company. This implies potential headwinds or challenges that investors should consider. While the headline doesn't explicitly state a negative outlook, the 'wary' sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of a negative impact on the stock price. The lack of specific details in the provided content makes a precise probability estimation difficult, but the cautionary tone leans towards a higher probability of a price fall. The time horizon is also important, as the impact is predicted for 2025, allowing time for the market to digest and react to the underlying concerns, whatever they may be. Given the lack of specifics, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple is a strong company and can weather many storms.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Apple's status as the world's largest company but cautions investors about the stock in 2025.  This is a bearish sentiment piece, suggesting potential future risks rather than immediate positive news.  While being the largest company is generally positive, the article's focus on future wariness implies concerns about factors like slowing growth, increased competition, economic downturns, or potential regulatory challenges.  Without specifics on *why* investors should be wary, it's difficult to assign precise probabilities. However, the overall tone leans negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall than a rise in response to this news alone.  It's crucial to remember that this is just one news article and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.  Other factors, such as overall market conditions and Apple's financial performance, will significantly influence the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution for investors regarding Apple's stock in 2025, implying potential risks or challenges ahead. While Apple's current status as the largest company in the world indicates strong performance, the warning could reflect concerns about market saturation, regulatory issues, or competitive pressures. Given the lack of specific details in the news content, the analysis leans towards a neutral to slightly negative sentiment. However, Apple's historical resilience and innovation capabilities may mitigate some downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses both positive and negative factors influencing Apple's stock price. On the positive side, Apple is investing heavily in AI, has a strong financial position, pays a growing dividend, and has a history of repurchasing shares. However, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's valuation, noting that its price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-cash flow ratios are higher than their five-year averages. Additionally, the company has not introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time, which could impact its growth potential. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is significant due to the high valuation and potential for profit-taking.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position as the largest company in the world, with a market value of $3.68 trillion. It highlights both reasons to invest in Apple, such as its heavy investment in artificial intelligence and dividend payments, and reasons to be cautious, including its high valuation and lack of revolutionary new products. The article concludes that while Apple is likely to continue growing, its current price may be overvalued, and investors should be wary. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, due to the concerns about overvaluation and the potential for a correction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on a common issue faced by iPhone users related to storage capacity. While it might be seen as a non-material issue for investors, it can also be interpreted as a minor inconvenience that does not directly impact the financial health, growth prospects, or competitive position of Apple. The content suggests ways to reclaim space, which might even lead to increased usage of iCloud services, potentially boosting revenue. Thus, the direct impact on stock price movement due to this news seems limited.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of Apple Inc. While the company is the largest in the world with strong revenue and profitability, concerns about its high valuation metrics and lack of recent revolutionary products may lead to cautious investor sentiment. The potential for a stock price rise is supported by ongoing investments in AI and a history of strong performance, but the overvaluation and market corrections could lead to a price decline. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions and the cautious tone of the article, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline expresses caution about Apple's stock in 2025 despite its current leading position. This suggests potential future challenges or risks. The previous rounds of predictions mostly lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting the 'wary' sentiment in the headline. While Apple is a strong company, the lack of revolutionary products and high valuation are concerns. Considering the consensus from previous predictions and the cautionary tone of the headline, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple has demonstrated resilience. The time horizon of 2025 allows for market adjustments and reactions to any underlying issues.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline expresses caution regarding Apple's stock in 2025 despite its current market leadership.  While the article lacks specifics, the overall tone is bearish.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight majority leaning towards a price fall.  The consensus seems to be that Apple's high valuation and lack of recent revolutionary products are key concerns.  While Apple's strong fundamentals and investments in AI offer potential for growth, the inherent risk associated with its current valuation and the uncertainty surrounding future innovation outweigh the positive factors in the context of this news alone.  The time horizon of 2025 allows for significant market shifts and unforeseen events to impact the stock price.  Considering the previous predictions and the vague nature of the news, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, but not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging Apple's resilience and potential for future growth.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a cautious outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025, despite its current status as the largest company in the world. The article likely highlights concerns such as high valuation, lack of revolutionary products, and potential market corrections. Previous predictions from various models indicate a general trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for a fall and 0.3 to 0.55 for a rise. The consensus leans towards a negative sentiment due to the 'wary' tone of the news, suggesting potential headwinds. However, Apple's strong historical performance and ongoing investments in AI could mitigate some downside risks. Given the mixed signals but with a stronger emphasis on caution, the probabilities are adjusted slightly towards a higher chance of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses both positive and negative factors influencing Apple's stock price.
