Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of Apple Inc. While the company is the largest in the world with strong revenue and profitability, concerns about its high valuation metrics and lack of recent revolutionary products may lead to cautious investor sentiment. The potential for a stock price rise is supported by ongoing investments in AI and a history of strong performance, but the overvaluation and market corrections could lead to a price decline. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of both potential growth and risk of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses iPhone storage issues and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which adds to the cost. This could be interpreted in a few ways. On one hand, it highlights a potential pain point for consumers, which could lead to negative sentiment. On the other hand, it subtly promotes upgrading to newer, more expensive iPhones, which could boost Apple's revenue. However, the article primarily focuses on a common user problem and offers a solution that involves spending more money. This is unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in either direction. The impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as it reinforces the idea that consumers may need to upgrade to continue using Apple products effectively. The overall sentiment is mildly positive for Apple's revenue prospects, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Apple's status as the world's largest company but cautions investors about the stock in 2025.  This is a bearish sentiment piece, suggesting potential future risks rather than immediate positive news.  While being the largest company is generally positive, the article's focus on future wariness implies concerns about factors like slowing growth, increased competition, economic downturns, or potential regulatory challenges.  Without specifics on *why* investors should be wary, it's difficult to assign precise probabilities. However, the overall tone leans negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall than a rise in response to this news alone.  It's crucial to remember that this is just one news article and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.  Other factors, such as overall market conditions and Apple's financial performance, will significantly influence the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue faced by iPhone users\u2014limited storage\u2014and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution. This could imply potential increased sales for Apple's higher-storage models, which are more expensive and may boost revenue. However, the article does not introduce any groundbreaking news or significant changes to Apple's business model, products, or financial health. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive. The probability of a rise is marginally higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain close to neutral due to the lack of substantial news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the current status of Apple Inc. as the largest company in the world with a market value of $3.68 trillion. It highlights both positive and negative factors for investing in Apple stock. On the positive side, Apple has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), has a growing dividend yield, and is financially healthy with a lucrative business. However, the article also cautions that Apple's valuation is high, with a recent price-to-sales ratio of 9.5, a price-to-earnings ratio of 39.8, and a forward-looking P/E ratio of 32.4. These metrics suggest that the stock might be overvalued, which could lead to a fall in stock price if the company's growth does not meet expectations. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time, which could impact its future growth. Based on these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.55, reflecting the company's strong financials and potential for AI-driven growth. Conversely, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is 0.35, due to its high valuation and potential for a market correction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which could potentially increase sales for Apple. However, the article does not provide any significant or surprising information that would drastically impact the company's stock price. It appears to be a neutral or slightly positive article, but its impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are close to 50%.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong financial performance and market leadership but also points out concerns over valuation and lack of recent revolutionary new products. The stock has shown significant volatility recently with high returns in some years and losses in others. The cautionary tone suggests that investors might be wary of overvaluation, which could lead to price corrections.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of Apple Inc. While the company is the largest in the world with strong revenue and profitability, concerns about its high valuation metrics and lack of recent revolutionary products may lead to cautious investor sentiment. The potential for a stock price rise is supported by ongoing investments in AI and a history of strong performance, but the overvaluation and market corrections could lead to a price decline. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of both potential growth and risk of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common problem for iPhone users: running out of storage. The suggested solution is to upgrade to a new phone with more storage, which costs more. This is a subtle way of promoting upgrades and potentially increasing revenue for Apple. However, it's not groundbreaking news and doesn't significantly alter the company's outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight leaning towards a positive impact, but not a strong one. The article highlights a user pain point that Apple already addresses with its product line, so it's unlikely to cause a major shift in investor sentiment. Given the mixed opinions in previous rounds, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more positive outlook, but still keeping it relatively neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content express caution regarding Apple's stock in 2025 despite its current status as the world's largest company.  While the article doesn't offer specific reasons for this wariness, the overall tone is bearish.  Previous predictions are mixed, with several models leaning towards a roughly equal probability of a rise or fall, while others show a slightly higher probability of a fall.  The lack of concrete negative news in the article itself suggests that the bearish sentiment is likely driven by broader market concerns or anxieties about Apple's future growth potential, rather than any immediate negative event. Considering the mixed predictions and the somewhat vague nature of the warning, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the cautious tone of the headline and the potential for market corrections given Apple's high valuation. However, the probability of a rise remains significant, given Apple's strong historical performance and ongoing investments in AI.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage, suggesting users upgrade to a new phone with more storage, which could potentially increase sales for Apple's higher-storage, more expensive models. This is a mildly positive signal for revenue, but the article does not introduce any groundbreaking news or significant changes to Apple's business model. Previous predictions from other models generally leaned towards a neutral to slightly positive impact, with probabilities of a rise and fall being close to balanced. Considering the lack of substantial news and the neutral to slightly positive tone of the article, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a marginal bias towards a rise due to the potential for increased sales, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which could potentially increase sales for Apple. However, the article does not provide any significant or surprising information that would drastically impact the company's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mix of opinions, but most models agree that the impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The probabilities of a stock price rise and fall are estimated based on the overall sentiment of the news article and the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as the world's largest company with strong financial metrics but also expresses caution due to high valuation and lack of innovative products. Previous predictions show mixed opinions with a slight tilt towards a potential fall in stock price. The analysis considers both the positive aspects such as strong financial health, dividend yield, and AI investments, but also the high valuation metrics and potential market correction risks. The overall sentiment leans towards cautiousness, with historical data suggesting volatility.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
