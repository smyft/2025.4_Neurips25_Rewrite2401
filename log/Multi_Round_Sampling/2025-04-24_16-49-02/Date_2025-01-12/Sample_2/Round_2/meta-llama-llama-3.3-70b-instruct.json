Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline suggests caution regarding Apple's stock despite its status as the largest company in the world. This implies potential concerns about future performance, which could lead investors to be wary. The mention of being 'wary' typically indicates a negative sentiment, which may lead to a higher probability of stock price decline. Therefore, while Apple is a strong company, the caution expressed in the news could lead to a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses iPhone storage issues and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which adds to the cost. This could be interpreted in a few ways. On one hand, it highlights a potential pain point for consumers, which could lead to negative sentiment. On the other hand, it subtly promotes upgrading to newer, more expensive iPhones, which could boost Apple's revenue. However, the article primarily focuses on a common user problem and offers a solution that involves spending more money. This is unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in either direction. The impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as it reinforces the idea that consumers may need to upgrade to continue using Apple products effectively. The overall sentiment is mildly positive for Apple's revenue prospects, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses iPhone storage limitations and the potential for users to upgrade to phones with more storage. While this might indirectly suggest potential increased sales of new iPhones with higher storage capacities, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The article does not contain any information about Apple's financials, product development, or market competition that would significantly influence investor sentiment.  The connection between the need for more storage and a stock price movement is weak and indirect. Therefore, the probability of a stock price increase or decrease due to this news is very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current position in the market, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, investments in AI, and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks are noted. However, the article also points out concerns regarding Apple's high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E ratios) compared to its five-year averages, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. Additionally, the lack of recent revolutionary product introductions is seen as a potential risk for future growth. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is considered to be somewhat evenly balanced, with a slight edge towards caution due to the overvaluation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss a common issue faced by iPhone users regarding storage space, but do not contain any significant financial information that could impact Apple's stock price. The article seems more focused on providing user advice rather than announcing any company developments, financial results, or changes in market conditions. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position as the largest company in the world, with a market value of $3.68 trillion, and its potential for future growth through investments in artificial intelligence and dividend payments. However, it also highlights the company's high valuation metrics, such as price-to-sales ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, and price-to-cash flow ratio, which may indicate that the stock is overvalued. Additionally, the article notes that Apple has not introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time, which could impact its future growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still significant due to the company's strong financials and potential for future growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests caution for investors considering the stock in 2025, implying potential risks associated with Apple Inc. The phrase 'Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary' indicates negative sentiment which could lead to a decrease in investor confidence. However, it is important to consider that being the largest company in the world can also be seen as a positive factor, indicating strength and market dominance. Without further context or details about the underlying factors mentioned in the news, the cautious tone is likely to have a more immediate impact on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that while Apple is the largest company in the world, there are reasons for investors to be cautious about its stock in 2025. This suggests potential concerns regarding future performance, which could lead to a higher probability of stock price decline. The previous predictions show a trend of caution among analysts, with many highlighting overvaluation and lack of recent innovative products as significant risks. Therefore, the overall sentiment leans towards a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a common user problem (iPhone storage) and suggests a solution that involves spending more money (upgrading to a new phone). While this might be a minor annoyance for users, it also subtly promotes upgrading, which could benefit Apple's revenue. However, the article doesn't present any significant financial information or company developments that would drastically impact the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment due to the user frustration aspect, but the potential for increased revenue from upgrades provides a counterbalancing positive. Given the mixed signals and the generally low impact of this type of news, I'll slightly lean towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, but not significantly. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly negative outlook, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a minor user inconvenience (full iPhone storage) and suggests a solution (buying a more expensive phone).  This is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price. While it could subtly promote higher-priced iPhone sales, the effect is likely to be minimal and short-lived. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall or a neutral outcome.  However, the lack of substantial negative news in the article itself suggests that a significant price drop is improbable. Considering the overall sentiment and the lack of direct impact on Apple's financials, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome (neither rise nor fall) than a significant movement in either direction.  The previous predictions, while varied, don't provide strong evidence of significant positive or negative information beyond the article itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current position, highlighting both its strengths and potential risks. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, investments in AI, and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks are noted. However, the article also points out concerns regarding Apple's high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E ratios) compared to its five-year averages, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. Additionally, the lack of recent revolutionary product introductions is seen as a potential risk for future growth. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is considered to be somewhat evenly balanced, with a slight edge towards caution due to the overvaluation concerns and the cautious tone of the headline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue faced by iPhone users regarding storage space and potential solutions, such as upgrading to a new phone with more storage. While this issue might prompt some users to consider purchasing a new iPhone with higher storage capacity, which could positively impact Apple's sales, it does not provide any direct financial information or insights into Apple's future performance that would significantly influence investor sentiment. The article seems more focused on providing user advice rather than announcing any company developments, financial results, or changes in market conditions that could impact the stock price. Given that the news does not contain any revolutionary or significant information about Apple's financial health, products, or market position, it is likely to have a minimal impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively low, with a slight inclination towards a cautious view due to potential overvaluation concerns and the company's reliance on consumer upgrades rather than revolutionary product changes.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current position in the market, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, investments in AI, and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks are noted. However, the article also points out concerns regarding Apple's high valuation metrics compared to its five-year averages, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. Additionally, the lack of recent revolutionary product introductions is seen as a potential risk for future growth. Considering the mixed signals and the cautious tone of the article, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling due to overvaluation concerns and others suggesting a more neutral or slightly positive outlook. Taking into account the balanced view presented in the article and the range of opinions from other models, the estimated probabilities are provided.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests caution for investors considering the stock in 2025, implying potential risks associated with Apple Inc. The phrase 'Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary' indicates negative sentiment which could lead to a decrease in investor confidence. The news does not provide any specific negative financial information or major concerns that would drastically impact the stock price, but the overall cautious tone is likely to have an immediate impact on investor sentiment. Previous predictions from models suggest a mix of sentiments ranging from neutral to negative, but most lean towards a cautious outlook.
