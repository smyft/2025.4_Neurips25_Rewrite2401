Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution regarding Apple's stock despite its status as the largest company in the world. This implies potential concerns about future performance, which could lead investors to be wary. The mention of being 'wary' typically indicates a negative sentiment, which may result in a higher probability of stock price decline. Therefore, while there may still be some optimism about Apple's growth, the overall sentiment leans towards a potential decrease in stock price due to investor caution.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses iPhone storage issues and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which adds to the cost. This could be interpreted in a few ways. On one hand, it highlights a potential pain point for consumers, which could lead to negative sentiment. On the other hand, it subtly promotes upgrading to newer, more expensive iPhones, which could boost Apple's revenue. However, the article primarily focuses on a common user problem and offers a solution that involves spending more money. This is unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in either direction. The impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as it reinforces the idea that consumers may need to upgrade to continue using Apple products effectively. The overall sentiment is mildly positive for Apple's revenue prospects, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple's stock, highlighting both positive and negative factors.  Positive factors include strong financials, AI investments, dividend payouts, and share buybacks.  However, the article emphasizes the high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, forward P/E, and price-to-cash flow) compared to historical averages, suggesting the stock might be overvalued.  The lack of recent revolutionary products is also mentioned as a potential concern. While past performance is impressive, sustaining such high growth rates is unlikely given Apple's current size. The author's personal experience of reducing their Apple holdings due to valuation concerns and diversification further supports a cautious outlook.  The overall tone leans towards caution, suggesting a higher probability of a price correction than significant further gains in the short to medium term.  However, the long-term prospects remain positive due to Apple's strong brand and financial health.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses iPhone storage limitations and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage, which could increase revenue for Apple Inc. However, the article does not indicate any significant positive or negative impact on the company's financial performance or market perception. The content is more informational rather than impactful, so the effect on the stock price is likely neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that despite Apple being the largest company in the world, investors should be wary of the stock in 2025. This implies a cautious or negative outlook for Apple's stock performance in the near future. The headline does not provide specific reasons for the caution but implies potential risks or challenges ahead. Based on this, it seems that the news might have a negative impact on investor sentiment, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. However, given that Apple is a well-established company with a strong market presence, the impact might be moderate. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors should be wary of Apple's stock in 2025, implying potential caution or negative outlook. This could be due to various factors such as market saturation, increased competition, or economic uncertainties. As the largest company in the world, Apple's stock is closely watched and any perceived weakness could lead to a decline in stock price. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in these concerns, and the stock price may not be significantly affected. Given the cautious tone of the headline, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong financial performance and market leadership but also points out concerns over valuation and lack of recent revolutionary new products. The stock has shown significant volatility recently with high returns in some years and losses in others. The cautionary tone suggests that investors might be wary of overvaluation, which could lead to price corrections.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that despite Apple's status as the largest company in the world, there are reasons for investors to be cautious about the stock in 2025. This suggests potential concerns regarding future performance, which could lead to a negative sentiment among investors. The previous predictions also reflect a general trend of caution, with many models indicating a higher probability of stock price decline due to valuation concerns and market saturation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on a common user frustration (iPhone storage) and subtly promotes upgrading to a new, more expensive iPhone as a solution. While this could be seen as a potential revenue driver for Apple, the article's primary focus on a user problem and the cost of upgrading suggests a slightly negative sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that the news is either neutral or slightly negative. Given this, I'll adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, but not drastically, as the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced perspective on Apple's stock, highlighting both its strengths (strong financials, AI investments, dividend payouts, share buybacks) and weaknesses (high valuation, lack of recent revolutionary products).  The high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E ratios significantly above their five-year averages) are a major concern, suggesting the stock may be overvalued and susceptible to a correction. While Apple's long-term prospects remain positive due to its brand strength and financial health, the immediate risk of a price decline due to overvaluation is significant. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the article's focus on valuation concerns and the lack of a near-term catalyst for significant growth, a price correction seems more likely than a substantial rise in the short term.  However, the probability of a fall isn't overwhelmingly high, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the possibility of a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage limitations and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which could increase revenue for Apple Inc. However, the content is more informational and does not indicate any significant positive or negative impact on the company's financial performance or market perception. Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions from previous models (ranging from slightly positive to slightly negative), the overall impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards a neutral to slightly negative sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that despite Apple being the largest company in the world, investors should be wary of the stock in 2025. This cautious tone implies potential concerns about future performance, which could lead investors to be cautious. The mention of being 'wary' typically indicates a negative sentiment, which may result in a higher probability of stock price decline. However, considering Apple's strong financials, brand loyalty, and historical performance, there is still a possibility for the stock price to rise, albeit with a lower probability. Based on the analysis of previous predictions, there is a general sentiment leaning towards caution, but not a unanimous bearish outlook. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution regarding Apple's stock despite its status as the largest company in the world, implying potential concerns about future performance. This cautious tone, combined with the lack of specific positive news, leads to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling. The previous predictions from other models also generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models citing concerns over valuation, lack of revolutionary new products, and potential market saturation. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment appears to be negative, which supports a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong financial performance and market leadership but also points out concerns over valuation and lack of recent revolutionary new products. The stock has shown significant volatility recently with high returns in some years and losses in others. The cautionary tone suggests that investors might be wary of overvaluation, which could lead to price corrections. Previous predictions from different models suggest a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall due to concerns over valuation and market saturation.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
