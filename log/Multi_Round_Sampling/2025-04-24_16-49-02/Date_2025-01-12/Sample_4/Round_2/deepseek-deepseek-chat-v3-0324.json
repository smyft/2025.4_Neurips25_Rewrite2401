Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses iPhone storage issues and the potential for customers to upgrade to new phones with more storage. While this could indicate ongoing sales opportunities for Apple, the article does not present any significant positive or negative news that would strongly influence investor sentiment. Therefore, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the potential for increased sales from upgrades.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses iPhone storage issues and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which adds to the cost. This could be interpreted in a few ways. On one hand, it highlights a potential pain point for consumers, which could lead to negative sentiment. On the other hand, it subtly promotes upgrading to newer, more expensive iPhones, which could boost Apple's revenue. However, the article primarily focuses on a common user problem and offers a solution that involves spending more money. This is unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in either direction. The impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as it reinforces the idea that consumers may need to upgrade to continue using Apple products effectively. The overall sentiment is mildly positive for Apple's revenue prospects, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Apple's status as the world's largest company but cautions investors about the stock in 2025.  This is a bearish sentiment piece, suggesting potential future risks rather than immediate positive news.  While being the largest company is generally positive, the article's focus on future wariness implies concerns about factors like slowing growth, increased competition, economic downturns, or potential regulatory challenges.  The lack of specific details in the provided text makes it difficult to assign precise probabilities. However, the overall tone leans negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall than a rise in the near term, although the long-term outlook (2025) is inherently uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple's current position and future prospects. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent dividend growth, share buybacks, and heavy investment in AI are highlighted as reasons to invest. However, the article also cautions about Apple's high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, P/CF ratios) compared to its five-year averages, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. Additionally, the lack of recent revolutionary product launches is noted as a potential risk. Given Apple's historical performance and current valuation, the stock may face downward pressure in the short term, but its strong fundamentals and AI potential could support long-term growth. The probabilities reflect this mixed outlook with a slight tilt towards caution due to valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue faced by iPhone users related to storage capacity but does not provide any direct financial impact, company performance indicators, or significant announcements that could influence Apple's stock price. The content seems more focused on providing a solution or workaround for users experiencing storage issues rather than impacting the company's financials or operations. Therefore, it's unlikely to have a substantial effect on the stock price based on this information alone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights both positive and negative aspects of investing in Apple stock. On the positive side, Apple's heavy investment in artificial intelligence, its dividend payments, and its financially healthy position are mentioned as reasons to invest. However, the article also notes that Apple's valuation metrics, such as its price-to-sales ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, and price-to-cash flow ratio, are higher than their five-year averages, indicating potential overvaluation. Additionally, the lack of a revolutionary new product introduction in a long time is cited as a reason for caution. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling, as the overvaluation and lack of innovation might lead to a correction in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution for investors considering the stock in 2025, implying potential risks associated with Apple's future performance. While being the largest company can indicate strong market position, it also comes with significant expectations and regulatory scrutiny, which could be a concern. This cautious tone may lead to short-term selling pressure.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue faced by iPhone users regarding storage capacity and suggests upgrading to newer models as a solution. This could indicate potential sales opportunities for Apple, as users may be prompted to purchase new devices. However, the article does not present any significant positive or negative news that would strongly influence investor sentiment. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards caution due to valuation concerns and lack of innovation. Overall, the sentiment appears mildly positive due to the potential for increased sales from upgrades, but not strong enough to suggest a significant price movement. Therefore, I estimate a slight inclination towards a rise in stock price, but with a notable probability of a fall due to existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue for iPhone users: running out of storage. It frames upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which directly benefits Apple's sales. While not a groundbreaking announcement, it subtly reinforces the need for consumers to upgrade, potentially driving revenue. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight positive sentiment overall, but not overwhelmingly so. I'll adjust the probabilities slightly upwards for a rise, acknowledging the potential for increased sales, but not significantly, as the article primarily addresses a user problem rather than a major company announcement. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a fall due to valuation concerns, but this specific news is more directly related to potential revenue generation.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and the lack of specific details in the provided text create a predominantly negative sentiment. While Apple's size is a positive factor, the warning about 2025 suggests concerns about future performance.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall.  The models that predicted a higher probability of a fall generally cited concerns about overvaluation, lack of innovative products, and potential future risks.  While some models pointed to positive aspects like AI investment and strong financials, the overall tone of the news and the majority of previous predictions suggest a higher likelihood of a price decrease.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty involved in predicting future stock movements based on limited information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current position and future prospects.

The probabilities reflect this mixed outlook with a slight tilt towards caution due to valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue faced by iPhone users related to storage capacity and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution. This could be interpreted as a neutral to slightly positive factor for Apple, as it implies potential for increased sales from upgrades. However, the article does not present any significant positive or negative news that would strongly influence investor sentiment. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed outlook, with some models predicting a slight inclination towards a rise and others towards a fall, but generally with probabilities close to 0.5. Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling, reflecting a cautiously optimistic view based on potential upgrade sales.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current position and future prospects, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent dividend growth, share buybacks, and heavy investment in AI are noted as reasons to invest. However, the article also cautions about Apple's high valuation metrics compared to its five-year averages, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. Additionally, the lack of recent revolutionary product launches is noted as a potential risk.

The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall than a rise in the near term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests caution for investors considering the stock in 2025, implying potential risks associated with Apple's future performance. The majority of the previous predictions indicate a bearish sentiment, with several models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Factors such as overvaluation, lack of revolutionary products, and potential regulatory challenges contribute to this cautious tone.
