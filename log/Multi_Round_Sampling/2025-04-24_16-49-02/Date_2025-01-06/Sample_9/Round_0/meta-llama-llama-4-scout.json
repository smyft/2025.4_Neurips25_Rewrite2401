(AAPL) as one of them. However, the news could still have an indirect impact on AAPL's stock price if investors interpret Buffett's investment strategy as a sign of confidence in certain stocks, potentially leading to increased interest in his top holdings. Given that AAPL is a widely held and prominent stock, its price movement is often influenced by overall market sentiment and significant investor actions. However, without direct mention or confirmation of AAPL being one of the stocks, the impact is likely to be neutral or minimal. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential increased investor confidence, but the overall impact is expected to be limited.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
