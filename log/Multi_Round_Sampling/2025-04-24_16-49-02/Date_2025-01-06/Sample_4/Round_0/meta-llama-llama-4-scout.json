However, it does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. The news does not provide direct information about Apple Inc. or its stock performance. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, but with a slight lean towards stability (no change) due to the indirect nature of the news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.30\n}\n```"
