The news might have an indirect positive effect on Apple's stock price if investors perceive Buffett's investment strategy as a vote of confidence. However, without direct confirmation of Apple's inclusion in these five stocks or any specific details about Apple, the impact is likely to be neutral or mildly positive at best.
