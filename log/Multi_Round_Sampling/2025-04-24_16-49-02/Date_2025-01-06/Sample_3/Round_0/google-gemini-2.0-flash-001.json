This represents a substantial potential upside. However, it's important to note that this is just one analyst's opinion, and the market's reaction will depend on various factors, including overall market sentiment, other analysts' opinions, and the company's actual performance. The fact that the article poses the question 'Is It a Buy Around $250?' suggests some uncertainty or debate around the stock's current valuation. Given the potential upside highlighted by the analyst, there's a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the single analyst opinion and the question posed in the headline temper the enthusiasm somewhat.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Apple Is Going to $325.
