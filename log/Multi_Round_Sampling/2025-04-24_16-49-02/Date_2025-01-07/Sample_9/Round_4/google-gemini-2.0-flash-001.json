(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. This type of news typically leads to a decrease in investor confidence, which can result in a decline in stock price. Given the lack of specific details in the news content, the overall implication is still negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX, with negative sentiment towards IBM and Pure Storage. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned only in passing, stating that it has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025' and is grouped with IBM and Pure Storage as companies with limited upside revisions. This suggests a slightly negative outlook for Apple, as it implies that Apple may not benefit significantly from the AI boom in the near term. However, the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple stock or predict a price decline. The impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal, but slightly negative due to the lack of AI exposure mentioned. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline \"Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors\" is extremely vague.  Without any specific information about the nature of the unfortunate news, it's impossible to make a reasoned prediction about the probability of a stock price rise or fall.  The headline itself creates negative sentiment, suggesting a higher probability of a price drop. However, the lack of specifics makes any quantitative estimate unreliable.  A more informed prediction would require details about the news, such as the impact on sales, production, legal issues, or any other relevant factor.  Therefore, the probabilities below reflect the uncertainty inherent in the vague headline, leaning towards a higher probability of a fall due to the negative framing.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests negative sentiment or unfavorable developments for Apple Inc. This could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially resulting in a fall in the stock price. The vague nature of the headline does not provide specific details, but the implication of 'unfortunate news' generally leans towards negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests that the news content is likely to be negative for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Typically, such headlines indicate potential challenges, declines in performance, or other adverse developments. Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise. The lack of specific details in the headline makes it difficult to quantify the impact precisely, but the general tone implies a negative outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a downgrade of Apple's stock due to a lukewarm reception of its AI, which suggests a negative sentiment towards the company's recent developments. This downgrade, combined with the analyst's lack of confidence in the company, implies a bearish outlook for the stock. As a result, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as preferred stocks for 2025, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple Inc. is only mentioned in the context of having minimal exposure to AI-related revenue, which is expected to limit upside revisions. This suggests that the news is not directly relevant to Apple Inc.'s prospects and does not provide strong indications of near-term stock price movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' strongly suggests negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. This type of vague but negative framing typically leads to decreased investor confidence, which is likely to result in a decline in stock price. The previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most estimates around 0.8 for falling and 0.2 for rising. Given the lack of specific details in the news content, the overall implication remains negative, reinforcing the expectation of a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX, with negative sentiment towards IBM and Pure Storage. Apple is mentioned only in passing, stating that it has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025' and is grouped with IBM and Pure Storage as companies with limited upside revisions. This suggests a slightly negative outlook for Apple, as it implies that Apple may not benefit significantly from the AI boom in the near term. However, the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple stock or predict a price decline. The impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal, but slightly negative due to the lack of AI exposure mentioned. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is a consensus that the news is slightly negative for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' is highly vague and creates a negative bias.  However, the lack of specifics makes a strong prediction difficult.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall (0.7-0.8).  One model (qwen/qwen-turbo) suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook (0.4 rise, 0.3 fall) based on the news focusing on other companies and Apple's minimal AI exposure.  Considering the vague headline and the spread of predictions, a conservative approach is warranted.  The absence of concrete negative news suggests the impact might be less severe than initially implied by the headline.  Therefore, I'm adjusting the probability of a fall slightly lower than the majority of previous predictions, acknowledging the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests negative sentiment, which typically leads to a decrease in investor confidence and a potential decline in stock price. While the news content is vague, the overall implication is negative. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most estimates around 0.7-0.8 for a fall and 0.2-0.3 for a rise. The lack of specific details in the news content makes it difficult to quantify the exact impact, but the general tone and consensus from other models suggest a bearish outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. Although the news content is vague and does not provide specific details, the headline itself implies potential unfavorable developments for the company. This type of news typically leads to a decrease in investor confidence, which can result in a decline in stock price. Considering the lack of specific details, the overall implication is still negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Stock Catches a Downgrade. Why This Analyst Isn\u2019t Impressed' suggests a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. due to a lukewarm reception of its AI. This downgrade, combined with the analyst's lack of confidence in the company, implies a bearish outlook for the stock. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which also indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising. However, the fact that some models have a relatively higher prediction of the stock price rising suggests that there might be some positive information about the stock that is not reflected in the news headline. Taking this into consideration, I adjust my prediction to be slightly more balanced, but still leaning towards a higher probability of a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as preferred stocks for 2025, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple Inc. is only mentioned in the context of having minimal exposure to AI-related revenue, which is expected to limit upside revisions. While the news doesn't explicitly highlight Apple negatively, it indirectly suggests that Apple may not benefit significantly from the AI boom in the near term. Given the previous predictions indicating a bearish outlook and the limited relevance of the news to Apple, the probability of a stock price decline is higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' strongly suggests negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. This type of vague but negative framing typically leads to decreased investor confidence, which is likely to result in a decline in stock price.

However, the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple stock or predict a price decline. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a consensus that the news is slightly negative for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not drastically so, as the news primarily concerns other companies. I am adjusting the probability of a fall slightly lower than the majority of previous predictions, acknowledging the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline is vague and creates a negative bias, but lacks specifics.  The initial predictions were overwhelmingly bearish (0.7-0.8 probability of a fall), primarily due to the negative headline. However, some models, particularly qwen/qwen-turbo, pointed out the news's limited direct relevance to Apple, focusing instead on other companies.  Round 1 shows a slight shift towards a more balanced view, with some models increasing their probability of a rise.  The lack of concrete negative news about Apple itself suggests the impact might be less severe than initially implied. Considering the vague headline, the initial strong bearish sentiment, and the subsequent slight moderation in round 1, a conservative estimate is warranted.  The consensus leans towards a fall, but the absence of specific negative information about Apple mitigates the severity of the predicted drop.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests negative sentiment, which typically leads to a decrease in investor confidence and a potential decline in stock price.

Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most estimates ranging from 0.65 to 0.8 for a fall and 0.2 to 0.4 for a rise. Considering the lack of specific details and the negative framing of the headline, it's reasonable to infer that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise. However, the absence of concrete negative news makes the prediction slightly less certain, leading to a slightly adjusted estimate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Stock Catches a Downgrade.
