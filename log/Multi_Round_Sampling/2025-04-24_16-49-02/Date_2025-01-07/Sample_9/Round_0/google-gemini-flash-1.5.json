Without any specific information about the nature of the unfortunate news, it's impossible to make a reasoned prediction about the probability of a stock price rise or fall.  The headline itself creates negative sentiment, suggesting a higher probability of a price drop. However, the lack of specifics makes any quantitative estimate unreliable.  A more informed prediction would require details about the news, such as the impact on sales, production, legal issues, or any other relevant factor.  Therefore, the probabilities below reflect the uncertainty inherent in the vague headline, leaning towards a higher probability of a fall due to the negative framing.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.2,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.8\n}\n```\n"
