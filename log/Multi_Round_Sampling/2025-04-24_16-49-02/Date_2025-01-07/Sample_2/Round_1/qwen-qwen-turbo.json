(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. This type of news typically leads to a decrease in investor confidence, which can result in a decline in stock price. Given the lack of specific details in the news content, the overall implication is still negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple due to an analyst's downgrade and lukewarm reception of their AI. Downgrades typically lead to negative price action as investors re-evaluate their positions. The mention of 'lukewarm' AI reception further reinforces the negative outlook, suggesting potential concerns about Apple's future growth and innovation in a key area. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative analyst sentiment towards Apple, citing a lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives as a key factor.  Analyst downgrades often negatively impact stock prices, as they signal a potential shift in future earnings expectations. While Apple is a large and generally stable company, negative news, especially concerning innovation in key areas like AI, can still cause short-term price fluctuations.  The probability of a price fall is therefore higher than a price rise, but the impact is likely to be moderate given Apple's overall market position and resilience.  The probability estimates are subjective and based on general market reactions to similar news events.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has received a downgrade from an analyst, citing a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI and a lack of confidence. Analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment, which can lead to a decrease in stock price. Given the negative tone of the news and the specific mention of AI-related concerns, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content mention UBS's recommendations for 2025, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Specifically, UBS analysts highlight that Apple (AAPL) has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth prospects for the company in the near term due to its minimal exposure to AI revenue. This could lead to limited upside revisions for Apple's stock price in 2025. As a result, the news might have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, but the overall effect is likely to be neutral or mildly negative due to the lack of direct negative commentary on Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' implies negative news for the company, which would likely have a negative impact on the stock price. Given the lack of specific details in the news content, the analysis relies solely on the negative tone of the headline. Typically, unfortunate news for investors leads to a decrease in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as preferred stocks for 2025, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple is mentioned only in the context of having minimal AI-related exposure, similar to IBM and Pure Storage. Given this context, the news does not provide specific positive or negative guidance for Apple Inc.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
