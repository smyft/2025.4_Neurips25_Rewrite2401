(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by an analyst suggests a lack of confidence in the company's performance, particularly due to a lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives. This negative sentiment is likely to lead to a decrease in investor confidence, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling. While some investors may still see potential for growth, the overall negative outlook from the downgrade weighs heavily on the stock's immediate prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple due to an analyst's downgrade and lukewarm reception of their AI. Downgrades typically lead to negative price pressure as investors re-evaluate their positions. The mention of 'lukewarm' AI reception further reinforces the negative outlook, suggesting potential concerns about Apple's future growth and innovation in a key area. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, specifically highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as strong buys for 2025 due to their expected growth in AI-related revenue and overall market recovery.  Conversely, the report advises against IBM and Pure Storage, citing limited AI exposure and other headwinds.  Apple is mentioned only in passing, as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025'. This implies that the news is largely neutral for Apple. While the lack of negative news is positive, the absence of any specific positive catalysts related to Apple in this report suggests a low probability of a significant price increase directly attributable to this news.  The probability of a price fall is also low, as the news is not negative for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors,' which suggests negative sentiment or adverse developments affecting Apple Inc. Given the lack of specific details in the news content, the headline alone implies potential negative impact on investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. However, without concrete information, the probabilities are estimated based on the negative tone of the headline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock has been downgraded by an analyst, who is not impressed with the company's performance, particularly citing a 'lukewarm' reception to its AI. This negative sentiment from an analyst is likely to impact investor confidence negatively. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article does not directly predict the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, but rather mentions it as one of the companies with minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year, along with IBM and Pure Storage. This implies that UBS does not expect significant growth or upside revisions for Apple in 2025 due to its limited AI-related revenue. However, the article does not explicitly state a negative outlook for Apple, and the mention is brief. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a downgrade on Apple's stock due to lack of investor confidence, particularly in their AI offerings. The term 'lukewarm' suggests negative market sentiment which could lead to selling pressure on the stock. Such negative analyst opinions typically contribute to downward pressure on stock prices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by an analyst, coupled with a lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives, suggests a significant negative sentiment surrounding the stock. This is likely to lead to decreased investor confidence and increased selling pressure. The majority of previous predictions indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts emphasizing the negative implications of the downgrade. Given this context, I estimate a high probability of the stock price falling and a lower probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment expressed in the initial round of predictions, stemming from the analyst downgrade and lukewarm AI reception, strongly suggests a downward pressure on Apple's stock price. The consensus leans heavily towards a higher probability of the stock falling. Considering this collective negative outlook, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly stronger bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector and doesn't offer a specific outlook on Apple's stock.  While Apple is mentioned as having minimal AI-related revenue exposure in 2025, this is presented as a neutral observation rather than a negative assessment.  The lack of specific positive or negative news regarding Apple in this report suggests a minimal impact on its stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance in the context of this news. Considering the overall neutrality of the report concerning Apple and the lack of strong catalysts for either a rise or fall, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral than the previous predictions, which leaned heavily towards a price fall.  The previous predictions may reflect other information not included in this report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions from other models indicate a general consensus that the stock is more likely to fall due to factors such as analyst downgrades and lukewarm reception of AI initiatives. The lack of specific positive catalysts in the news further supports this negative outlook. However, some models noted the news might be neutral, suggesting the impact isn't overwhelmingly negative. Considering the overall negative tone and the collective analysis of previous models, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock has been downgraded by an analyst due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI initiatives. This negative sentiment is likely to impact investor confidence negatively. The consensus from various models is that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. While some models provide a slightly varied outlook, the overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact on the stock price due to the downgrade and lukewarm reception of AI. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.25 and the probability of it falling to be 0.75.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses UBS's top picks for 2025, which include Dell and TD SYNNEX, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple is mentioned as having minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year, which may limit its upside. However, the article does not explicitly state a negative outlook for Apple. Considering the neutral mention of Apple and the lack of specific negative news, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the perceived lack of growth catalysts. Given the information, a moderate probability of a stock price fall is estimated, while the probability of a rise is lower due to the absence of positive catalysts in the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) coupled with a lack of investor confidence, especially around AI initiatives. Multiple models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling based on the negative sentiment from analysts and the lukewarm reception of AI. Although some models suggest a slightly lower likelihood of price fall, the overall trend indicates a negative outlook. Therefore, considering the negative sentiment and lack of positive information, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by an analyst, coupled with a lukewarm reception of its AI initiatives, has created a negative sentiment surrounding the stock. This has led to a consensus among various models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. The majority of previous predictions indicate a bearish outlook, emphasizing the lack of investor confidence and potential selling pressure. While some models suggest a neutral impact, the overall trend leans towards a significant likelihood of a price decline. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of the stock price falling and a lower probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment surrounding Apple's stock due to the analyst downgrade and lukewarm AI reception continues to dominate the outlook. The previous rounds of predictions overwhelmingly favor a higher probability of the stock price falling. While some models considered a more neutral stance, the prevailing negative sentiment and lack of positive catalysts suggest a continued downward pressure. Therefore, I maintain a high probability of the stock price falling, slightly adjusted to reflect the continued negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector and largely ignores Apple.  Apple's mention is brief and neutral, highlighting its minimal AI-related revenue for 2025. This lack of specific positive or negative news regarding Apple suggests a minimal impact on its stock price from this report alone.  The previous predictions show a wide range, with a strong bias towards a price fall, likely influenced by other information not included in this report.  While the absence of positive news is slightly negative, the lack of any significant negative news makes a large price movement unlikely.  Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral, acknowledging the previous predictions' strong bearish sentiment but emphasizing the limited direct relevance of this news to Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc.

This negative sentiment from an analyst, coupled with lukewarm reception of AI, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The consensus from previous predictions is that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise, with many models citing the downgrade and negative outlook on AI initiatives as key factors. While some models provide a slightly varied outlook, the overall sentiment leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not directly predict the performance of Apple Inc.

(AAPL) coupled with a lack of investor confidence, especially around AI initiatives. The majority of previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to negative analyst opinions and lukewarm reception of AI technology. While there are some models suggesting a slightly lower likelihood of a price fall, the overall trend continues to indicate a negative outlook. Given the consistency in the negative sentiment and the lack of positive catalysts in the news, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple Inc.

However, the consistent neutrality of the UBS report regarding Apple, coupled with the lack of any significant negative news directly related to Apple in this specific report, suggests that the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) is low.  The previous predictions' strong bearish sentiment is likely due to factors outside the scope of this news. Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral, acknowledging the previous predictions but emphasizing the limited direct relevance of this news to Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Unfortunate News for Apple Stock Investors' suggests a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc.
