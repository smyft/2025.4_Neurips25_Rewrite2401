(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by an analyst suggests a lack of confidence in the company's current performance, particularly regarding its AI initiatives. A lukewarm reception can lead to negative sentiment among investors, which typically results in a higher probability of stock price decline. Given the context of the downgrade and the analyst's concerns, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple due to an analyst's downgrade and lukewarm reception of their AI. Downgrades typically lead to negative price pressure as investors re-evaluate their positions. The mention of 'lukewarm' AI reception further reinforces the negative outlook, suggesting potential concerns about Apple's future growth and innovation in a key area. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, specifically highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as strong buys for 2025 due to their expected growth in AI-related revenue and overall market recovery.  Conversely, the report advises against IBM and Pure Storage, citing limited AI exposure and other headwinds.  Apple is mentioned only in passing, as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025'. This implies that the news is largely neutral for Apple. While the lack of significant AI revenue might be viewed negatively by some investors, it's not a strong negative indicator given Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio.  The probability of a price rise or fall is therefore considered low, with the most likely scenario being minimal change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights UBS's outlook for the enterprise hardware and networking sector, specifically naming Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025 while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Notably, Apple is mentioned in the context of having minimal exposure to AI-related revenue in 2025, which could limit upside revisions. Given that the news does not directly impact Apple's core business positively or negatively, and the mention is more of a side note, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, the slight negative connotation regarding AI exposure might lead to a minor negative sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock has been downgraded by an analyst. The analyst mentions that Apple fails to inspire confidence, partly due to a 'lukewarm' reception of its AI. A downgrade typically implies a negative outlook on the stock's performance. Therefore, it is likely that the stock price will fall as investors react to this downgrade and the analyst's concerns about Apple's AI reception. The probability of the stock price rising seems low given the negative sentiment expressed in the downgrade.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses UBS's top picks for 2025, which include Dell and TD SYNNEX, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Although Apple is mentioned as having minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year, it is not a primary focus of the article. The article highlights the strengths of Dell and TD SYNNEX, including expected revenue growth and favorable risk-reward profiles. In contrast, IBM and Pure Storage are expected to have limited upside due to minimal AI exposure and other growth headwinds. Since Apple is not a primary focus of the article and is only mentioned in passing as having minimal AI exposure, the impact on its stock price is likely to be limited. However, given the general trend of the article highlighting the importance of AI exposure for growth, Apple's lack of significant AI-related revenue in 2025 might slightly negatively impact its stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a downgrade for Apple Inc., citing a lack of confidence from an analyst due to a lukewarm reception of their AI technology. This negative sentiment is likely to impact investor confidence negatively, which could lead to a decrease in demand for the stock. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst opinions have often resulted in downward pressure on stock prices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This mention is neutral to slightly negative, as it suggests Apple may not benefit from the AI-driven growth expected in other companies. However, the lack of direct negative commentary or downgrade specific to Apple mitigates the impact. Given Apple's strong financial position and diversified product portfolio, the news is unlikely to significantly sway investor sentiment. The previous predictions from other models also reflect a mixed but generally neutral to slightly negative outlook, with probabilities leaning more towards a fall than a rise. Considering all these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is expected to be modest.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
