(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by an analyst suggests a lack of confidence in the company's current performance, particularly regarding its AI initiatives. A lukewarm reception can lead to negative sentiment among investors, which typically results in a higher probability of stock price decline. Given the context of the downgrade and the analyst's concerns, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX, with negative sentiment towards IBM and Pure Storage. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned only in passing, stating that it has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025' and therefore limited upside revisions are expected. This is a slightly negative sentiment, suggesting that Apple might not benefit significantly from the AI boom in the short term. However, the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple stock or predict a price decline. The impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal, but slightly negative due to the lack of AI exposure mentioned by UBS. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, specifically highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as strong buys for 2025 due to their expected growth in AI-related revenue and overall market recovery.  Conversely, the report advises against IBM and Pure Storage, citing limited AI exposure and other headwinds.  Apple is mentioned only in passing, as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025'. This implies that the news is largely neutral for Apple. While the lack of significant AI revenue might be viewed negatively by some investors, it's not a strong negative indicator given Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio.  The probability of a price rise or fall is therefore considered low, with the most likely scenario being minimal change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article from UBS provides a sector outlook favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage, including Apple (AAPL) in the list of companies with minimal AI revenue exposure in 2025. For Apple, the mention is negative as it suggests limited upside due to 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025.' Given that AI-driven growth is a significant market driver, this could lead to reduced investor enthusiasm for AAPL in the near term. However, Apple's strong brand, diversified product portfolio, and other growth drivers might mitigate some of the negative impact. The probability of a stock price fall is higher due to the negative sentiment around AI exposure, but not overwhelmingly so given Apple's overall market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content mention UBS's recommendations for 2025, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Specifically, UBS highlights that Apple (AAPL) has minimal exposure to AI revenue in 2025, which could lead to limited upside revisions for the stock. This analysis suggests a cautious or negative outlook for Apple's stock price in 2025 based on the UBS report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses UBS's top picks for 2025, which include Dell and TD SYNNEX, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Although Apple is mentioned as having minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year, it is not a primary focus of the article. The analysis suggests that companies with significant AI-driven growth potential, such as Dell, are expected to perform well. In contrast, companies like IBM and Pure Storage, with limited AI exposure, are expected to have limited upside. Apple's mention is brief and does not provide a clear indication of its performance. However, given the lack of positive or negative sentiment towards Apple in the article, the probabilities of its stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be relatively balanced, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or stable movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as preferred stocks for 2025, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple Inc. is only mentioned in the context of having minimal exposure to AI-related revenue, which is expected to limit upside revisions. This suggests that the news is not directly relevant to Apple Inc.'s prospects and does not provide strong indications of near-term stock price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
