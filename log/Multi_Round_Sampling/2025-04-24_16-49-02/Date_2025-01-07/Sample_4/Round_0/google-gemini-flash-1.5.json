Analyst downgrades often negatively impact stock prices, as they signal a potential shift in future earnings expectations. While Apple is a large and generally stable company, negative news, especially concerning innovation in key areas like AI, can still cause short-term price fluctuations.  The probability of a price fall is therefore higher than a price rise, but the impact is likely to be moderate given Apple's overall market position and resilience.
