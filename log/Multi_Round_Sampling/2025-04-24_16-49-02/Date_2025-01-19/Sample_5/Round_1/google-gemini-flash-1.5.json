(AAPL): \u2018I Think When You Say Stuff Like Nothing\u2019s Been Done Since Steve Jobs Died, I Think That\u2019s An Ill-advised Strategy To Take I Think\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. .\u00a0 .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics giant that earns billions of dollars through its iconic iPhone. The smartphone is also a central part of its hypothesis as half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue comes from it. The firm's reliance on the iPhone and its closed ecosystem came under fire from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hadn't innovated since the death of its iconic founder Steve Jobs. Cramer took aim at these and other comments made by Zuckerberg:\n\n\"[On Zuckerberg saying Apple hasn't done anything since the iPhone] I. . [laughs hysterically] don't know what to say. I mean, David, look, I don't want to make it too central an issue because it was a love fest, a libertarian love fest, uh but David the one thing [that] is absolutely certain was that if you really want to say the most horrible things about Apple, you say first of all that nothing's been done since Jobs, two that they lock out everything, three that they make every single innovation, hold it.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, which suggests a positive outlook from a respected investor known for identifying high-growth stocks. The company's strong financial performance, with a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% increase in operating income, further supports a bullish sentiment. Additionally, Apple's focus on AI innovations and environmentally conscious manufacturing positions it favorably in the market. While the article acknowledges that other stocks may have higher short-term potential, the overall positive sentiment and strong fundamentals suggest a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on the institutional ownership of Apple (AAPL). While high institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company, the article also points out the potential vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could be interpreted negatively. The general public ownership is also significant, but not enough to counter institutional decisions. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, highlighting potential risks associated with institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments are mixed and don't provide a clear direction for Apple's stock price. While he dismisses Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's post-Jobs innovation as 'ill-advised,' the fact that Zuckerberg's comments were made and received significant media attention could negatively impact investor sentiment.  The overall news piece is quite broad, covering wildfires, interest rates, and political commentary, making it difficult to isolate the impact on Apple specifically.  Zuckerberg's criticism, while dismissed by Cramer, still highlights a potential vulnerability in the narrative around Apple's continued innovation and growth.  The lack of a clear, direct, and overwhelmingly positive or negative assessment from Cramer, coupled with the broader context of the news, suggests a relatively neutral impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome, with slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment surrounding Zuckerberg's comments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional owners, with 61% ownership. Institutional ownership can be a double-edged sword: while it often indicates confidence in the company, large-scale trades by institutions can lead to significant price volatility. The article mentions that 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders, and there have been recent sales by insiders. Insider sales can sometimes signal a lack of confidence, but the article also notes that insider ownership is under 1%, which is not unusual for a large company like Apple. The general public owns 37%, which is substantial but not enough to sway decisions independently. Given the mixed signals\u2014strong institutional confidence but potential for large-scale selling\u2014the stock price could be influenced by institutional trading behavior. However, Apple's strong market position and historical performance may mitigate some downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks. Navellier is a well-known investor with a successful track record in identifying high-growth stocks. The article emphasizes Apple's robust financial performance, including a 6% year-over-year revenue increase to $94.9 billion and a 15% increase in operating income to $27.9 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Additionally, Apple's advancements in AI, such as Apple Intelligence, Siri improvements, and the Apple Neural Engine, are noted as significant factors. The article also mentions Apple's commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing, with a target of using 100% recycled cobalt in all batteries by 2025. Given Navellier's reputation and the positive financial and strategic developments highlighted, the news is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions that CEOs from various companies, including Apple's competitors, will be in attendance and may make comments that could affect the market. The article also mentions the potential for discussions about AI, tariffs, and crypto, which could impact Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple or its stock price. Given the lack of specific information about Apple, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news is more focused on upcoming IPOs rather than providing any specific information or impact on Apple. Without direct correlation, it's unlikely that this news would have a significant immediate effect on Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While he dismisses Zuckerberg's criticism, the criticism itself, and its wide dissemination, presents a potential negative impact on investor sentiment.  The overall news piece is broad, making it difficult to isolate the impact on Apple.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news's effect.  Cramer's dismissal of Zuckerberg's comments is a positive factor, but the negative sentiment generated by those comments remains a significant consideration.
