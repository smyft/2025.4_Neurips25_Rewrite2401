(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, which suggests a positive outlook from a respected investor known for identifying high-growth stocks. The company's strong financial performance, with a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% increase in operating income, further supports a bullish sentiment. Additionally, Apple's focus on AI innovations and environmentally conscious manufacturing positions it favorably in the market. While the article acknowledges that other stocks may have higher short-term potential, the overall positive sentiment and strong fundamentals suggest a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on the institutional ownership of Apple (AAPL). While high institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company, the article also points out the potential vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could be interpreted negatively. The general public ownership is also significant, but not enough to counter institutional decisions. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, highlighting potential risks associated with institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments are mixed and don't provide a clear direction for Apple's stock price. While he dismisses Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's post-Jobs innovation as 'ill-advised,' the fact that Zuckerberg's comments were made and received significant media attention could negatively impact investor sentiment.  The overall news piece is quite broad, covering wildfires, interest rates, and political commentary, making it difficult to isolate the impact on Apple specifically.  Zuckerberg's criticism, while dismissed by Cramer, still highlights a potential vulnerability in the narrative around Apple's continued innovation and growth.  The lack of a clear, direct, and overwhelmingly positive or negative assessment from Cramer, coupled with the broader context of the news, suggests a relatively neutral impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome, with slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment surrounding Zuckerberg's comments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional owners, with 61% ownership. Institutional ownership can be a double-edged sword: while it often indicates confidence in the company, large-scale trades by institutions can lead to significant price volatility. The article mentions that 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders, and there have been recent sales by insiders. Insider sales can sometimes signal a lack of confidence, but the article also notes that insider ownership is under 1%, which is not unusual for a large company like Apple. The general public owns 37%, which is substantial but not enough to sway decisions independently. Given the mixed signals\u2014strong institutional confidence but potential for large-scale selling\u2014the stock price could be influenced by institutional trading behavior. However, Apple's strong market position and historical performance may mitigate some downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks. Navellier is a well-known investor with a successful track record in identifying high-growth stocks. The article emphasizes Apple's robust financial performance, including a 6% year-over-year revenue increase to $94.9 billion and a 15% increase in operating income to $27.9 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Additionally, Apple's advancements in AI, such as Apple Intelligence, Siri improvements, and the Apple Neural Engine, are noted as significant factors. The article also mentions Apple's commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing, with a target of using 100% recycled cobalt in all batteries by 2025. Given Navellier's reputation and the positive financial and strategic developments highlighted, the news is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions that CEOs from various companies, including Apple's competitors, will be in attendance and may make comments that could affect the market. The article also mentions the potential for discussions about AI, tariffs, and crypto, which could impact Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple or its stock price. Given the lack of specific information about Apple, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news is more focused on upcoming IPOs rather than providing any specific information or impact on Apple. Without direct correlation, it's unlikely that this news would have a significant immediate effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, which suggests a positive outlook from a respected investor known for identifying high-growth stocks. The company's strong financial performance, with a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% increase in operating income, further supports a bullish sentiment. Additionally, Apple's focus on AI innovations and environmentally conscious manufacturing positions it favorably in the market. While some previous predictions indicated mixed sentiments due to institutional ownership and insider sales, the overall positive developments and Navellier's endorsement suggest a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), which can be a double-edged sword. While it indicates confidence, large institutional trades can cause volatility. The article also mentions that the top 25 shareholders hold 41% and recent insider sales, which could signal a lack of confidence, though insider ownership is low overall. The general public owns 37%, a significant but not controlling stake. Considering these factors, the stock price could be influenced by institutional trading behavior. The previous rounds show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a rise due to positive factors like AI innovation, while others are more cautious due to potential risks associated with institutional ownership and insider sales. Given the current news and the trend of previous predictions, I'll slightly lean towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple are mixed. While he dismisses Zuckerberg's criticism, the criticism itself, and its wide dissemination, presents a potential negative impact on investor sentiment.  The overall news piece is broad, making it difficult to isolate the impact on Apple.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news's effect.  Cramer's dismissal of Zuckerberg's comments is a positive factor, but the negative sentiment generated by those comments remains a significant consideration.  Given the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative news directly impacting Apple's fundamentals, and the conflicting opinions in previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate, with a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the lingering negative sentiment from Zuckerberg's interview.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional owners, with 61% ownership. While institutional ownership can indicate confidence in the company, it also means the stock price could be more volatile due to large-scale trading decisions by these institutions. The article mentions recent insider sales and that 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders, which could be seen as negative signals. However, the general public owns 37%, which provides some balance. The mixed signals from institutional dominance and insider sales suggest a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is among Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks. Louis Navellier is a well-known investor with a successful track record in identifying high-growth stocks. The article highlights Apple's robust financial performance, including a 6% year-over-year revenue increase to $94.9 billion and a 15% increase in operating income to $27.9 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.

The article also mentions Apple's commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing, with a target of using 100% recycled cobalt in all batteries by 2025. These positive factors suggest a bullish sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Navellier & Associates' stake in Apple is $13.4 million, which is a relatively small position compared to other stocks. Furthermore, the general market conditions and other factors not specified in the article could influence the stock price. Considering the positive outlook from a respected investor and the company's strong financials and strategic developments, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. While the article mentions various companies and topics, including AI, tariffs, and crypto, it does not provide any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. However, the overall tone of the article suggests a sense of uncertainty and potential volatility in the market, which could indirectly affect Apple's stock price. Considering the lack of direct information about Apple and the mixed signals from the article, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively balanced, but with a slight leaning towards a neutral to negative outcome due to the general market uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news focuses on upcoming IPOs rather than Apple's specific performance or future developments. Previous predictions indicate mixed sentiments, with some models suggesting a positive outlook based on various factors like institutional ownership and financial performance, while others lean towards a neutral or slightly negative outlook due to broader market conditions and potential risks. Since the provided headline lacks specific details related to Apple, the impact on the stock price is minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
