(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's positive view on Apple, indicating that it is a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. While Buffett did not label Apple as a 'forever stock' in his latest letter, his praise suggests confidence in its long-term potential. Additionally, the overall bullish sentiment from analysts regarding Apple, combined with its strong market position and historical performance, supports a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the mention of other stocks like Chevron and Coca-Cola as better options for income investors may create some downward pressure on Apple's stock in the short term. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, but with some risk of a fall due to competitive comparisons.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on the institutional ownership of Apple (AAPL). While high institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company, the article also points out the potential vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could be interpreted negatively. The general public ownership is also significant, but not enough to counter institutional decisions. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, highlighting potential risks associated with institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025\", is completely irrelevant to Apple Inc.  Apple is already a publicly traded company; therefore, this news about upcoming IPOs has no direct impact on its stock price. Any price movement in AAPL would be due to other market factors, not this news.  The probabilities are therefore assigned based on the assumption that the news has no effect.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any specific information about the company. Since the news is unrelated to Apple's business operations, financial performance, or market position, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal and largely neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions various CEOs, including those from big banks and tech companies, who will be in attendance. It also discusses the potential for Trump's policies to impact the market and the possibility of interest rate changes. The article specifically mentions Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned, but the tech industry and related companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia are discussed. Given the broad discussion of the tech industry and the potential for market volatility, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling based on the overall market sentiment and the potential impact of the discussions at Davos on the tech industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on various sectors including tech due to anticipated policy shifts favoring reduced regulations and increased M&A activities under the Trump administration. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. However, the article also mentions risks associated with automakers and construction, which might introduce a slight level of caution.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's positive view on Apple, emphasizing its significance in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Buffett's praise suggests confidence in Apple's long-term potential, which typically supports a bullish sentiment among investors. However, the article also mentions that other stocks, particularly Chevron and Coca-Cola, are being recommended for income investors, which could create some downward pressure on Apple's stock in the short term. Overall, the positive endorsement from Buffett and the strong market position of Apple lead to a higher probability of stock price increase, despite some competitive concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the high institutional ownership of Apple (61%). While this can be seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence from large investors, the article also points out the vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article mentions that 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders, implying that a significant portion of the stock is controlled by a relatively small group. Recent insider sales are also mentioned, which could be interpreted negatively. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to potential institutional selling pressure or negative sentiment from insider sales. However, the overall positive sentiment associated with high institutional ownership prevents a significantly high probability of a price drop. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with some models focusing on irrelevant news and others providing more balanced assessments. Given the specific information in this news piece, I'm leaning towards a slightly negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline, \"Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025,\" is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, mostly stemming from interpreting other, unprovided news sources.  Several models correctly identified the irrelevance of the provided headline.  Given the lack of relevant information in the provided news, and the wide divergence in predictions based on assumed external information, I will assign probabilities reflecting a neutral stance.  The slight bias towards a rise reflects the generally positive sentiment towards Apple in the market, independent of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' is unrelated to Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it focuses on upcoming initial public offerings and does not provide any direct information about Apple's business operations, financial performance, or market position. Given the irrelevance of the news to Apple, it is unlikely to have any significant impact on the company's stock price. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this, with most assigning neutral or minimal probabilities to price movements. Therefore, the probabilities are set to reflect no significant impact from this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the stock playbook for Trump's second term, highlighting top sector winners and losers. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, which is expected to benefit from lighter regulations and increased investment in AI under the Trump administration. Several tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, have contributed funds to Trump's inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship. Additionally, analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, expecting tech stocks to rise by 25% in 2025. Therefore, the overall sentiment suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market.

Given the broad discussion of the tech industry and the potential for market volatility, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling based on the overall market sentiment and the potential impact of the discussions at Davos on the tech industry. The presence of big bank CEOs and their outlook on interest rates, as well as the discussions on artificial intelligence and crypto, may influence the market. However, without direct mention of Apple, the impact on its stock price is uncertain. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the lack of direct information about Apple in the news, I assign a moderate probability to both a rise and a fall in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on various sectors including tech due to anticipated policy shifts favoring reduced regulations and increased M&A activities under the Trump administration. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. The article specifically mentions that the technology sector is expected to be a big winner due to a more favorable regulatory environment and increased M&A activity. However, it also acknowledges some potential risks associated with automakers, retailers, and construction, which introduces a slight level of caution.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's positive view on Apple, emphasizing its significance in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

While it indicates confidence from large investors, it also makes the stock vulnerable to their trading decisions. The article mentions that 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders, suggesting concentrated control. Recent insider sales are also noted, which could be a negative signal. Considering these factors, there's a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to potential institutional selling pressure or negative sentiment from insider sales. However, the overall positive sentiment associated with high institutional ownership prevents a significantly high probability of a price drop. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with some models focusing on irrelevant news and others providing more balanced assessments. Given the specific information in this news piece, I'm leaning towards a slightly negative outlook, but not drastically so, considering the inherent stability often associated with high institutional ownership in a company like Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025,\" is irrelevant to Apple Inc.  Therefore, any prediction of stock price movement based solely on this news should reflect a neutral stance.  However, the previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, influenced by assumed external information not provided in the prompt.  These predictions range from a strong belief in a price rise (0.7 probability) to a belief in a price fall (0.55 probability).  Considering the irrelevance of the given news and the divergence of opinions based on external factors, I will assign probabilities reflecting a neutral stance, slightly weighted towards a rise to reflect the generally positive market sentiment towards Apple.  The wide range of previous predictions suggests that other market factors are significantly influencing the price expectations, rather than the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' is completely irrelevant to Apple Inc.
