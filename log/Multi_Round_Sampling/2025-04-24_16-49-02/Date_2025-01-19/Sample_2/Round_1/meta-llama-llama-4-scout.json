      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: After shutting down, TikTok returns following Trump comments\nNews Content: TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, also had the option to divest its stake in the platform, but it chose not to despite there being interested buyers.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The presence of recent insider sales and the fact that institutional investors hold a substantial portion of the shares suggest that the stock could be vulnerable to downward pressure if these institutions decide to sell. Therefore, while there is a chance for price stability or growth due to institutional confidence, the risks associated with their influence lead to a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on the institutional ownership of Apple (AAPL). While high institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company, the article also points out the potential vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could be interpreted negatively. The general public ownership is also significant, but not enough to counter institutional decisions. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, highlighting potential risks associated with institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing strong financial performance, AI integration, and environmental initiatives.  However, the article also explicitly states that Navellier believes other stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in a shorter timeframe, ranking Apple only 5th on his list.  While the positive aspects of the news are noteworthy, the relatively low ranking and the article's own suggestion to consider other stocks temper the bullish sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high, given the context of the article's overall message. The probability of a price fall is low, as the news is largely positive, but the lack of strong endorsement suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential ban and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US, with implications for various tech companies including Apple. Apple's involvement is tangential as it relates to the App Store's compliance with the law. The positive sentiment around TikTok's potential restoration and Trump's intervention might marginally benefit Apple by reducing uncertainty around App Store operations and potential revenue impacts from TikTok's absence. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited given the broader context and Apple's diversified business model.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after a shutdown, influenced by comments from President-elect Donald Trump, has a minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as there is no clear connection mentioned between TikTok's operations and Apple's business. However, given that TikTok's situation could have broader implications on tech and social media landscape, and considering Trump's comments and actions could influence market perceptions of tech companies, especially those with significant operations in the US, the impact on Apple's stock is more indirect. The news does not specifically mention Apple or any direct relation to its products or services. Therefore, the movement in Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimally affected by this news about TikTok and Trump's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, and their potential for growth due to their involvement in the AI revolution. The article highlights the companies' strong track record of delivering capital growth and their potential to continue driving the S&P 500 higher. While the dividend yield of these stocks is relatively low, the article suggests that the primary reason to own these stocks is their potential for capital growth. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the positive outlook on the company's growth prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is included in Louis Navellier\u2019s Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. Navellier is known for his quantitative approach and successful track record in identifying high-growth stocks. The inclusion of AAPL in his picks, along with its strong financial performance, recent AI innovations, and environmentally conscious strategies, suggest positive sentiment from a reputable investor. However, the news also indicates that while AAPL is considered a good long-term pick, there may be other stocks with potentially higher returns in the short term.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
