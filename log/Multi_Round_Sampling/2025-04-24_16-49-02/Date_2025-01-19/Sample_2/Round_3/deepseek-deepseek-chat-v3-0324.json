(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The presence of recent insider sales and the fact that institutional investors hold a substantial portion of the shares suggest that the stock could be vulnerable to downward pressure if these institutions decide to sell. Therefore, while there is a chance for price stability or growth due to institutional confidence, the risks associated with their influence lead to a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on the institutional ownership of Apple (AAPL). While high institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company, the article also points out the potential vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could be interpreted negatively. The general public ownership is also significant, but not enough to counter institutional decisions. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, highlighting potential risks associated with institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing strong financial performance, AI integration, and environmental initiatives.  However, the article also explicitly states that Navellier believes other stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in a shorter timeframe, ranking Apple only 5th on his list.  While the positive aspects of the news are noteworthy, the relatively low ranking and the article's own suggestion to consider other stocks temper the bullish sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high, given the context of the article's overall message. The probability of a price fall is low, as the news is largely positive, but the lack of strong endorsement suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential ban and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US, with implications for various tech companies including Apple. Apple's involvement is tangential as it relates to the App Store's compliance with the law. The positive sentiment around TikTok's potential restoration and Trump's intervention might marginally benefit Apple by reducing uncertainty around App Store operations and potential revenue impacts from TikTok's absence. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited given the broader context and Apple's diversified business model.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after a shutdown, influenced by comments from President-elect Donald Trump, has a minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as there is no clear connection mentioned between TikTok's operations and Apple's business. However, given that TikTok's situation could have broader implications on tech and social media landscape, and considering Trump's comments and actions could influence market perceptions of tech companies, especially those with significant operations in the US, the impact on Apple's stock is more indirect. The news does not specifically mention Apple or any direct relation to its products or services. Therefore, the movement in Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimally affected by this news about TikTok and Trump's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, and their potential for growth due to their involvement in the AI revolution. The article highlights the companies' strong track record of delivering capital growth and their potential to continue driving the S&P 500 higher. While the dividend yield of these stocks is relatively low, the article suggests that the primary reason to own these stocks is their potential for capital growth. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the positive outlook on the company's growth prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is included in Louis Navellier\u2019s Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. Navellier is known for his quantitative approach and successful track record in identifying high-growth stocks. The inclusion of AAPL in his picks, along with its strong financial performance, recent AI innovations, and environmentally conscious strategies, suggest positive sentiment from a reputable investor. However, the news also indicates that while AAPL is considered a good long-term pick, there may be other stocks with potentially higher returns in the short term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The mention of recent insider sales adds to the concern, suggesting that the stock could be vulnerable to downward pressure if institutions decide to sell. Given these factors, the probability of a price decline is higher than that of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), which presents both opportunities and risks. While institutional ownership often signals confidence, it also makes the stock vulnerable to large-scale sell-offs. The article mentions recent insider sales, which could be a negative signal. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models initially leaned towards a price fall due to the potential for institutional selling pressure, while others were more optimistic. Given the inherent volatility introduced by institutional ownership and the slightly negative signal from insider sales, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but not drastically so, as institutional ownership can also provide stability. The trend in previous predictions seems to be towards a more balanced view after initial pessimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While it highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term picks, emphasizing strong financials, AI integration, and environmental initiatives, it also significantly downplays Apple's potential compared to other stocks in Navellier's portfolio, ranking it only 5th.  This suggests that while the news is generally positive, the lack of strong endorsement and the explicit mention of superior alternatives temper the bullish sentiment.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall.  Considering the mixed nature of the news and the divergence in previous predictions, a neutral stance is warranted. The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, reflecting the positive aspects of the news, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily revolves around TikTok's service disruption and potential restoration in the US, with mentions of Apple's role as a platform provider through the App Store. While Apple's involvement is indirect, the resolution of TikTok's issues could stabilize App Store operations and mitigate any potential revenue impacts. However, the broader political and legal uncertainties surrounding TikTok's future, along with the mixed reactions from lawmakers and allies, introduce some risk. Given Apple's diversified business model and the relatively minor direct impact of this news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The previous predictions also indicate a minimal direct impact, with some models suggesting a slight upside due to reduced uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, and their potential for growth due to their involvement in the AI revolution.

While Navellier rates Apple 5th on his list, suggesting that he believes other stocks might offer greater potential for higher returns, the overall sentiment remains positive. Previous predictions show a mix of views, but the majority lean towards a slight positive outlook due to Navellier's endorsement and the company's strong fundamentals. Given this information, the stock price is more likely to rise due to the positive sentiment from a reputable investor, though the low ranking tempers the bullish outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions.

While it indicates confidence, it also makes the stock vulnerable to large sell-offs. The article mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to potential institutional selling pressure, while others are more optimistic.

However, the article tempers this positivity by explicitly stating that other stocks in the same portfolio are considered to have higher short-term return potential, ranking Apple only 5th.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall, but the majority trend towards a slightly positive outlook.  Considering the mixed nature of the news and the divergence in previous predictions, a cautiously optimistic stance is warranted. The probability of a price rise is higher than a fall, reflecting the positive aspects of the news, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate, given the relatively low ranking within Navellier's portfolio and the lack of overwhelmingly bullish sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential ban and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US, with implications for various tech companies including Apple.

The news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any specific impact on its business operations. Given the lack of direct connection between TikTok's situation and Apple's core business, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, considering the general positive sentiment around the resolution of TikTok's issues, which could imply a stable or slightly positive outlook for tech companies operating in the US, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is estimated. The previous predictions from various models also indicate a mixed but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise due to positive growth prospects and institutional confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which are expected to drive the S&P 500 higher due to their involvement in the AI revolution.

The previous predictions show a range of opinions with a slight tilt towards a positive outlook due to the strong fundamentals and the backing of a reputable investor.
