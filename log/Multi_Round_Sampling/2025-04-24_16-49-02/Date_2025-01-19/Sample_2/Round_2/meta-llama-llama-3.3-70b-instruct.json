(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends From a $350,000 Investment in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks\nNews Content: The technology companies nicknamed the \"Magnificent Seven\" have a combined value of $17.2 trillion, which represents one-third of the entire value of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Those stocks delivered an average return of 60% during 2024, making them responsible for more than half of the S&P's 25% gain.NVDA data by YCharts.\n\nIn other words, investors whose portfolios didn't include the Magnificent Seven stocks last year probably underperformed the broader market by a wide margin. Since these seven companies dominate different areas of the technology industry, including new segments like artificial intelligence (AI), they are likely to continue driving the S&P 500 higher.\n\nBut some investors don't just want massive capital gains. They want regular income, and some Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. Unfortunately, as you'll see below, dividend investors won't get big payouts even from a massive $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nWhat's driving the Magnificent Seven now\n\nAI is the primary growth driver across most of the tech sector right now, which is why Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven last year. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the top choice for those who are developing AI models, and demand is outstripping supply because every tech company needs them to keep up with the competition.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are among Nvidia's biggest customers. They are filling their data centers with Nvidia's chips to develop their own AI software, but they also rent computing capacity to businesses and other AI developers. Their customers can also access state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic via Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has embedded AI into its recommendation engines on Facebook and Instagram with the goal of more accurately curating the content they deliver to each user to suit their preferences. This keeps people online for longer periods of time, which allows Meta to show them more ads and earn more revenue. And later this year, it expects to launch its Llama 4 LLM, which could be the most advanced in the industry.\n\nThen there is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which is on track to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers through its 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. The company recently debuted its Apple Intelligence software with a suite of new features that work only on its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. Apple Intelligence will create new opportunities for the company to generate software revenue, and also may encourage customers to upgrade their devices sooner.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFinally, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) might be known as one of the world's largest manufacturers of electric vehicles, but Wall Street is increasingly bullish about the prospects of its full self-driving software (FSD), which could transform the company's economics. FSD will power the new Cybercab, a robotaxi that will offer fully autonomous ride-hailing services to earn revenue for Tesla around the clock in the future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay modest dividends\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies are cash-generating machines. Some of them make so much money that they can't possibly reinvest it all back into their businesses to drive growth, so they return it to shareholders. Some of that money goes toward paying dividends.\n\nApple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet pay dividends quarterly. However, none of them has a dividend yield of more than 0.75% based on their recent share prices.MSFT Dividend Yield data by YCharts.\n\nYields change regularly for two reasons: First, a company might raise or lower its dividend payment. Second, a stock might rise or fall in value, which would change its yield on paper. It doesn't mean the payout changes in dollar terms, it just changes as a percentage of the current value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers investors the highest yield among the group, and although it may seem small at face value, the company paid out a whopping $21.7 billion in dividends during its last fiscal year (which ended June 30). Because Microsoft has a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, though, that translates into a relatively small yield.\n\nIf you invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock), you would earn an average dividend yield of 0.37% on $250,000, while earning no yield on the other $100,000 (because Amazon and Tesla don't offer a dividend). That works out to total annual dividend payments across the portfolio of about $925.\n\nThat's a paltry sum even compared to what you could earn in a high-yield savings account with your bank right now. However, it's a nice bonus on top of the incredible capital growth.\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven return more capital to shareholders\n\nDividends aren't the only way for companies to reward shareholders. They can also use stock buybacks, repurchasing their own shares on the open market. This shrinks the number of shares in circulation, which should organically increase the price per share proportionately. In the end, each remaining shareholder effectively owns a larger slice of the company than they did before.\n\nStock buybacks are also flexible. Companies can execute them at times of their choosing, such as when they view their shares as being undervalued.\n\nBecause of those benefits, repurchases make a much larger portion of the capital returned to shareholders in Magnificent Seven stocks than dividends. Five of the Magnificent Seven companies have repurchased stock over the last four quarters, spending a combined $236.9 billion:AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon and Tesla haven't been buying back stock lately, but both are profitable, so it might be an option for them in the future. Plus, Amazon repurchased $6 billion worth of stock back in 2022, so it's no stranger to handing some cash back to investors this way.\n\nWith all of that said, the best reason to own the Magnificent Seven stocks is their incredible track record of delivering capital growth. That's likely to continue for the foreseeable future because the AI revolution is still in its early stages, and depending on which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, it could add somewhere between $15.7 trillion (PwC) and $200 trillion (Ark Invest) to the global economy by 2030.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven will play an important role in creating that value, so investors should definitely consider owning these stocks for the long term. Any dividend payments they receive along the way will just be a bonus.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The presence of recent insider sales and the fact that institutional investors hold a substantial portion of the shares suggest that the stock could be vulnerable to downward pressure if these institutions decide to sell. Therefore, while there is a chance for price stability or growth due to institutional confidence, the risks associated with their influence lead to a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on the institutional ownership of Apple (AAPL). While high institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company, the article also points out the potential vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could be interpreted negatively. The general public ownership is also significant, but not enough to counter institutional decisions. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, highlighting potential risks associated with institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing strong financial performance, AI integration, and environmental initiatives.  However, the article also explicitly states that Navellier believes other stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in a shorter timeframe, ranking Apple only 5th on his list.  While the positive aspects of the news are noteworthy, the relatively low ranking and the article's own suggestion to consider other stocks temper the bullish sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high, given the context of the article's overall message. The probability of a price fall is low, as the news is largely positive, but the lack of strong endorsement suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential ban and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US, with implications for various tech companies including Apple. Apple's involvement is tangential as it relates to the App Store's compliance with the law. The positive sentiment around TikTok's potential restoration and Trump's intervention might marginally benefit Apple by reducing uncertainty around App Store operations and potential revenue impacts from TikTok's absence. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited given the broader context and Apple's diversified business model.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after a shutdown, influenced by comments from President-elect Donald Trump, has a minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as there is no clear connection mentioned between TikTok's operations and Apple's business. However, given that TikTok's situation could have broader implications on tech and social media landscape, and considering Trump's comments and actions could influence market perceptions of tech companies, especially those with significant operations in the US, the impact on Apple's stock is more indirect. The news does not specifically mention Apple or any direct relation to its products or services. Therefore, the movement in Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimally affected by this news about TikTok and Trump's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, and their potential for growth due to their involvement in the AI revolution. The article highlights the companies' strong track record of delivering capital growth and their potential to continue driving the S&P 500 higher. While the dividend yield of these stocks is relatively low, the article suggests that the primary reason to own these stocks is their potential for capital growth. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the positive outlook on the company's growth prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is included in Louis Navellier\u2019s Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. Navellier is known for his quantitative approach and successful track record in identifying high-growth stocks. The inclusion of AAPL in his picks, along with its strong financial performance, recent AI innovations, and environmentally conscious strategies, suggest positive sentiment from a reputable investor. However, the news also indicates that while AAPL is considered a good long-term pick, there may be other stocks with potentially higher returns in the short term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The mention of recent insider sales adds to the concern, suggesting that the stock could be vulnerable to downward pressure if institutions decide to sell. Given these factors, the probability of a price decline is higher than that of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), which presents both opportunities and risks. While institutional ownership often signals confidence, it also makes the stock vulnerable to large-scale sell-offs. The article mentions recent insider sales, which could be a negative signal. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models initially leaned towards a price fall due to the potential for institutional selling pressure, while others were more optimistic. Given the inherent volatility introduced by institutional ownership and the slightly negative signal from insider sales, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but not drastically so, as institutional ownership can also provide stability. The trend in previous predictions seems to be towards a more balanced view after initial pessimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While it highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term picks, emphasizing strong financials, AI integration, and environmental initiatives, it also significantly downplays Apple's potential compared to other stocks in Navellier's portfolio, ranking it only 5th.  This suggests that while the news is generally positive, the lack of strong endorsement and the explicit mention of superior alternatives temper the bullish sentiment.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall.  Considering the mixed nature of the news and the divergence in previous predictions, a neutral stance is warranted. The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, reflecting the positive aspects of the news, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily revolves around TikTok's service disruption and potential restoration in the US, with mentions of Apple's role as a platform provider through the App Store. While Apple's involvement is indirect, the resolution of TikTok's issues could stabilize App Store operations and mitigate any potential revenue impacts. However, the broader political and legal uncertainties surrounding TikTok's future, along with the mixed reactions from lawmakers and allies, introduce some risk. Given Apple's diversified business model and the relatively minor direct impact of this news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The previous predictions also indicate a minimal direct impact, with some models suggesting a slight upside due to reduced uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
