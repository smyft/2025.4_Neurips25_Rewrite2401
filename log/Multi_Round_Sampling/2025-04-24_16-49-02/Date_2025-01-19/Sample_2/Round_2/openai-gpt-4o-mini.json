(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The presence of recent insider sales and the fact that institutional investors hold a substantial portion of the shares suggest that the stock could be vulnerable to downward pressure if these institutions decide to sell. Therefore, while there is a chance for price stability or growth due to institutional confidence, the risks associated with their influence lead to a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on the institutional ownership of Apple (AAPL). While high institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company, the article also points out the potential vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could be interpreted negatively. The general public ownership is also significant, but not enough to counter institutional decisions. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, highlighting potential risks associated with institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing strong financial performance, AI integration, and environmental initiatives.  However, the article also explicitly states that Navellier believes other stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in a shorter timeframe, ranking Apple only 5th on his list.  While the positive aspects of the news are noteworthy, the relatively low ranking and the article's own suggestion to consider other stocks temper the bullish sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high, given the context of the article's overall message. The probability of a price fall is low, as the news is largely positive, but the lack of strong endorsement suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential ban and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US, with implications for various tech companies including Apple. Apple's involvement is tangential as it relates to the App Store's compliance with the law. The positive sentiment around TikTok's potential restoration and Trump's intervention might marginally benefit Apple by reducing uncertainty around App Store operations and potential revenue impacts from TikTok's absence. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited given the broader context and Apple's diversified business model.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after a shutdown, influenced by comments from President-elect Donald Trump, has a minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as there is no clear connection mentioned between TikTok's operations and Apple's business. However, given that TikTok's situation could have broader implications on tech and social media landscape, and considering Trump's comments and actions could influence market perceptions of tech companies, especially those with significant operations in the US, the impact on Apple's stock is more indirect. The news does not specifically mention Apple or any direct relation to its products or services. Therefore, the movement in Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimally affected by this news about TikTok and Trump's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, and their potential for growth due to their involvement in the AI revolution. The article highlights the companies' strong track record of delivering capital growth and their potential to continue driving the S&P 500 higher. While the dividend yield of these stocks is relatively low, the article suggests that the primary reason to own these stocks is their potential for capital growth. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the positive outlook on the company's growth prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is included in Louis Navellier\u2019s Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. Navellier is known for his quantitative approach and successful track record in identifying high-growth stocks. The inclusion of AAPL in his picks, along with its strong financial performance, recent AI innovations, and environmentally conscious strategies, suggest positive sentiment from a reputable investor. However, the news also indicates that while AAPL is considered a good long-term pick, there may be other stocks with potentially higher returns in the short term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The mention of recent insider sales adds to the concern, suggesting that the stock could be vulnerable to downward pressure if institutions decide to sell. Given these factors, the probability of a price decline is higher than that of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), which presents both opportunities and risks. While institutional ownership often signals confidence, it also makes the stock vulnerable to large-scale sell-offs. The article mentions recent insider sales, which could be a negative signal. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models initially leaned towards a price fall due to the potential for institutional selling pressure, while others were more optimistic. Given the inherent volatility introduced by institutional ownership and the slightly negative signal from insider sales, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but not drastically so, as institutional ownership can also provide stability. The trend in previous predictions seems to be towards a more balanced view after initial pessimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While it highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term picks, emphasizing strong financials, AI integration, and environmental initiatives, it also significantly downplays Apple's potential compared to other stocks in Navellier's portfolio, ranking it only 5th.  This suggests that while the news is generally positive, the lack of strong endorsement and the explicit mention of superior alternatives temper the bullish sentiment.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall.  Considering the mixed nature of the news and the divergence in previous predictions, a neutral stance is warranted. The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, reflecting the positive aspects of the news, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily revolves around TikTok's service disruption and potential restoration in the US, with mentions of Apple's role as a platform provider through the App Store. While Apple's involvement is indirect, the resolution of TikTok's issues could stabilize App Store operations and mitigate any potential revenue impacts. However, the broader political and legal uncertainties surrounding TikTok's future, along with the mixed reactions from lawmakers and allies, introduce some risk. Given Apple's diversified business model and the relatively minor direct impact of this news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The previous predictions also indicate a minimal direct impact, with some models suggesting a slight upside due to reduced uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, and their potential for growth due to their involvement in the AI revolution. The article highlights the companies' strong track record of delivering capital growth and their potential to continue driving the S&P 500 higher. While the dividend yield of these stocks is relatively low, the article suggests that the primary reason to own these stocks is their potential for capital growth.

Additionally, considering the predictions from other models, there is a general trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing strong financial performance, AI integration, and environmental initiatives. While Navellier rates Apple 5th on his list, suggesting that he believes other stocks might offer greater potential for higher returns, the overall sentiment remains positive. Previous predictions show a mix of views, but the majority lean towards a slight positive outlook due to Navellier's endorsement and the company's strong fundamentals. Given this information, the stock price is more likely to rise due to the positive sentiment from a reputable investor, though the low ranking tempers the bullish outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
