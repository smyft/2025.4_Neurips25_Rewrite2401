(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends From a $350,000 Investment in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks\nNews Content: The technology companies nicknamed the \"Magnificent Seven\" have a combined value of $17.2 trillion, which represents one-third of the entire value of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Those stocks delivered an average return of 60% during 2024, making them responsible for more than half of the S&P's 25% gain.NVDA data by YCharts.\n\nIn other words, investors whose portfolios didn't include the Magnificent Seven stocks last year probably underperformed the broader market by a wide margin. Since these seven companies dominate different areas of the technology industry, including new segments like artificial intelligence (AI), they are likely to continue driving the S&P 500 higher.\n\nBut some investors don't just want massive capital gains. They want regular income, and some Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. Unfortunately, as you'll see below, dividend investors won't get big payouts even from a massive $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nWhat's driving the Magnificent Seven now\n\nAI is the primary growth driver across most of the tech sector right now, which is why Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven last year. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the top choice for those who are developing AI models, and demand is outstripping supply because every tech company needs them to keep up with the competition.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are among Nvidia's biggest customers. They are filling their data centers with Nvidia's chips to develop their own AI software, but they also rent computing capacity to businesses and other AI developers. Their customers can also access state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic via Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has embedded AI into its recommendation engines on Facebook and Instagram with the goal of more accurately curating the content they deliver to each user to suit their preferences. This keeps people online for longer periods of time, which allows Meta to show them more ads and earn more revenue. And later this year, it expects to launch its Llama 4 LLM, which could be the most advanced in the industry.\n\nThen there is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which is on track to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers through its 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. The company recently debuted its Apple Intelligence software with a suite of new features that work only on its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. Apple Intelligence will create new opportunities for the company to generate software revenue, and also may encourage customers to upgrade their devices sooner.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFinally, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) might be known as one of the world's largest manufacturers of electric vehicles, but Wall Street is increasingly bullish about the prospects of its full self-driving software (FSD), which could transform the company's economics. FSD will power the new Cybercab, a robotaxi that will offer fully autonomous ride-hailing services to earn revenue for Tesla around the clock in the future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay modest dividends\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies are cash-generating machines. Some of them make so much money that they can't possibly reinvest it all back into their businesses to drive growth, so they return it to shareholders. Some of that money goes toward paying dividends.\n\nApple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet pay dividends quarterly. However, none of them has a dividend yield of more than 0.75% based on their recent share prices.MSFT Dividend Yield data by YCharts.\n\nYields change regularly for two reasons: First, a company might raise or lower its dividend payment. Second, a stock might rise or fall in value, which would change its yield on paper. It doesn't mean the payout changes in dollar terms, it just changes as a percentage of the current value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers investors the highest yield among the group, and although it may seem small at face value, the company paid out a whopping $21.7 billion in dividends during its last fiscal year (which ended June 30). Because Microsoft has a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, though, that translates into a relatively small yield.\n\nIf you invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock), you would earn an average dividend yield of 0.37% on $250,000, while earning no yield on the other $100,000 (because Amazon and Tesla don't offer a dividend). That works out to total annual dividend payments across the portfolio of about $925.\n\nThat's a paltry sum even compared to what you could earn in a high-yield savings account with your bank right now. However, it's a nice bonus on top of the incredible capital growth.\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven return more capital to shareholders\n\nDividends aren't the only way for companies to reward shareholders. They can also use stock buybacks, repurchasing their own shares on the open market. This shrinks the number of shares in circulation, which should organically increase the price per share proportionately. In the end, each remaining shareholder effectively owns a larger slice of the company than they did before.\n\nStock buybacks are also flexible. Companies can execute them at times of their choosing, such as when they view their shares as being undervalued.\n\nBecause of those benefits, repurchases make a much larger portion of the capital returned to shareholders in Magnificent Seven stocks than dividends. Five of the Magnificent Seven companies have repurchased stock over the last four quarters, spending a combined $236.9 billion:AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon and Tesla haven't been buying back stock lately, but both are profitable, so it might be an option for them in the future. Plus, Amazon repurchased $6 billion worth of stock back in 2022, so it's no stranger to handing some cash back to investors this way.\n\nWith all of that said, the best reason to own the Magnificent Seven stocks is their incredible track record of delivering capital growth. That's likely to continue for the foreseeable future because the AI revolution is still in its early stages, and depending on which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, it could add somewhere between $15.7 trillion (PwC) and $200 trillion (Ark Invest) to the global economy by 2030.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven will play an important role in creating that value, so investors should definitely consider owning these stocks for the long term. Any dividend payments they receive along the way will just be a bonus.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information or developments related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Instead, it discusses the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a broader market index. Since there is no direct impact on Apple from this news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling remain neutral. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced outlook with no significant influence from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dividend yields and capital growth potential. While the article highlights that the dividend yields are relatively low, it emphasizes the significant capital appreciation potential driven by AI and other technological advancements. For Apple specifically, the article mentions the launch of Apple Intelligence and its potential to drive software revenue and device upgrades. This positive outlook on Apple's future growth prospects, coupled with the overall positive sentiment surrounding the 'Magnificent Seven,' suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the article also mentions that the Motley Fool analysts identified other stocks that could produce monster returns, which could slightly dampen the enthusiasm for Apple. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks.  Navellier is a respected investor known for his quantitative approach. While the article mentions Apple's strong financial performance and AI integration, it also explicitly states that Navellier considers other stocks more promising for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  Apple's ranking 5th on the list suggests a positive outlook but not an overwhelmingly bullish one. The article's focus on other, potentially more attractive, investments tempers the positive impact of the endorsement. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is low, reflecting the overall market sentiment and the nuanced nature of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under President-elect Donald Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are expected to benefit sectors like technology. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is anticipated to gain from reduced regulatory scrutiny and increased investment in AI. Analysts like Dan Ives from Wedbush predict a favorable environment for tech stocks, with expectations of a 25% rise in 2025. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and its alignment with these positive trends, the stock is likely to benefit. However, the overall market volatility due to Trump's unpredictable approach could introduce some risk, but the net effect appears positive for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential shutdown in the US and the involvement of President Trump and his administration in finding a solution could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. The reason is that if TikTok is banned or shut down, it could lead to an increase in users and engagement on other social media platforms, potentially including Instagram and Facebook, which are owned by companies that compete with TikTok. However, the direct impact on Apple seems minimal as the company's stock movement is generally not directly tied to TikTok's operations but rather to its own ecosystem and product launches. Still, a positive resolution for TikTok could be seen as a broader ecosystem win for Apple, given that TikTok's availability on the App Store is maintained. On the other hand, uncertainty around TikTok's operations and its impact on social media landscape could introduce a neutral to slightly positive bias for companies not directly involved with TikTok, such as Apple, given that TikTok's presence and any potential resolution might not directly influence its stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions that CEOs from various companies, including Apple's competitors, will be in attendance and may make comments about their businesses and the economy. The article also mentions the potential for Trump's policies to impact the market. However, Apple is not directly mentioned in the article as being impacted by the events at Davos. Given the indirect nature of the news, I estimate a low probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?' does not contain any specific information related to Apple Inc. This news is more likely to be informational content rather than actionable news affecting the stock price of Apple Inc. There's no indication that this news will have an impact on the financial performance or market sentiment towards the company.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information or developments related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Instead, it discusses the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a broader market index. Given that there is no direct impact on Apple from this news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling remain neutral. This aligns with the previous predictions that also indicated a balanced outlook with no significant influence from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their potential for capital growth, particularly driven by AI. It highlights Apple's new Apple Intelligence software and its potential to drive revenue and device upgrades. While the dividend yield is low, the overall sentiment is positive regarding Apple's future growth prospects. Considering the positive outlook and Apple's strong position in the tech sector, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models being more bullish than others. I will adjust my prediction based on the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, a positive indicator.  Navellier's quantitative approach and strong track record lend credibility to this selection.  The article also cites Apple's strong financial performance and AI integration as positive factors. However, the article tempers this positive sentiment by explicitly stating that Navellier considers other stocks more promising for higher, shorter-term returns.  Apple's 5th place ranking further suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly bullish outlook.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability of a price rise (0.6-0.7) and others more neutral (0.5-0.55). Considering the mixed signals \u2013 positive endorsement but not the top pick, coupled with the generally strong performance of Apple \u2013 a slightly higher probability of a price rise is warranted, but not a dramatic one. The lack of significantly negative news prevents a high probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology, which is expected to benefit from lighter regulation and tax cuts.

Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses TikTok's temporary shutdown and potential reprieve under President Trump's executive order. While this development does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), it could have indirect implications. The shutdown of TikTok could potentially lead to increased user engagement and activity on other social media platforms, including those owned by Meta (META) and potentially benefiting Google (GOOG) and Apple, given their App Store and ecosystem roles. However, the direct impact on Apple is minimal, as the company's stock movement is generally tied to its own product launches, financial performance, and technological advancements. The positive resolution for TikTok, facilitated by President Trump, might slightly boost investor confidence in companies like Apple, which are not directly involved in the TikTok controversy but could benefit from a more favorable regulatory environment. Given the neutral to slightly positive implications for Apple, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned in the article, the overall sentiment and discussions about AI, tariffs, and Trump's policies could indirectly influence the stock price. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the lack of specific information about Apple, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news. The presence of other CEOs and the potential for market-moving comments suggest some level of uncertainty, but without direct reference to Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Navellier's respected quantitative approach adds weight to this endorsement.  The article also cites Apple's strong financial performance and AI integration. However, it explicitly states that Navellier considers other stocks more promising for higher, shorter-term returns, tempering the positive impact. Apple's 5th place ranking further suggests a positive but not extremely bullish outlook.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability of a price rise (0.6-0.7) and others more neutral (0.5-0.55). Considering the mixed signals \u2013 positive endorsement but not the top pick, coupled with the generally strong performance of Apple \u2013 a moderately higher probability of a price rise is warranted. The lack of significantly negative news prevents a high probability of a price fall.  The overall sentiment is slightly positive, but the lack of strong, specific catalysts limits the extent of the predicted price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, with a focus on technology as a likely beneficiary due to lighter regulation and tax cuts.
