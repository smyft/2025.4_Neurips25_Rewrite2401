(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock playbook for Trump's second term: Top sector winners and losers\nNews Content: Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts.\n\nThose two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%.\n\nYet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors.\n\nWinning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits.\n\n\"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\"\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said. He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d\n\nIndustrials\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHEICO (HEI) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector.\n\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs (PL), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector.\n\nAirlines\n\nIndustry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month.\n\nAnd industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote.\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts.\n\n\u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me.\n\nTech\n\nBig Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n612.77\n\n-\n\n+(0.24%)\n\nAt close: January 17 at 4:00:01 PM EST  METAAAPL GOOGL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nLosing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction\n\nAutomakers\n\nPlans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector.\n\nTom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama.\n\n\u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors (GM) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity.\n\nDiscount retailers\n\nDiscount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs, as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports.\n\nFor example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn (BOOT) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d\n\nConstruction\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada.\n\nAnd that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity.\n\n\u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information or developments related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Instead, it discusses the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a broader market index. Since there is no direct impact on Apple from this news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling remain neutral. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced outlook with no significant influence from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dividend yields and capital growth potential. While the article highlights that the dividend yields are relatively low, it emphasizes the significant capital appreciation potential driven by AI and other technological advancements. For Apple specifically, the article mentions the launch of Apple Intelligence and its potential to drive software revenue and device upgrades. This positive outlook on Apple's future growth prospects, coupled with the overall positive sentiment surrounding the 'Magnificent Seven,' suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the article also mentions that the Motley Fool analysts identified other stocks that could produce monster returns, which could slightly dampen the enthusiasm for Apple. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks.  Navellier is a respected investor known for his quantitative approach. While the article mentions Apple's strong financial performance and AI integration, it also explicitly states that Navellier considers other stocks more promising for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  Apple's ranking 5th on the list suggests a positive outlook but not an overwhelmingly bullish one. The article's focus on other, potentially more attractive, investments tempers the positive impact of the endorsement. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is low, reflecting the overall market sentiment and the nuanced nature of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under President-elect Donald Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are expected to benefit sectors like technology. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is anticipated to gain from reduced regulatory scrutiny and increased investment in AI. Analysts like Dan Ives from Wedbush predict a favorable environment for tech stocks, with expectations of a 25% rise in 2025. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and its alignment with these positive trends, the stock is likely to benefit. However, the overall market volatility due to Trump's unpredictable approach could introduce some risk, but the net effect appears positive for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential shutdown in the US and the involvement of President Trump and his administration in finding a solution could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. The reason is that if TikTok is banned or shut down, it could lead to an increase in users and engagement on other social media platforms, potentially including Instagram and Facebook, which are owned by companies that compete with TikTok. However, the direct impact on Apple seems minimal as the company's stock movement is generally not directly tied to TikTok's operations but rather to its own ecosystem and product launches. Still, a positive resolution for TikTok could be seen as a broader ecosystem win for Apple, given that TikTok's availability on the App Store is maintained. On the other hand, uncertainty around TikTok's operations and its impact on social media landscape could introduce a neutral to slightly positive bias for companies not directly involved with TikTok, such as Apple, given that TikTok's presence and any potential resolution might not directly influence its stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions that CEOs from various companies, including Apple's competitors, will be in attendance and may make comments about their businesses and the economy. The article also mentions the potential for Trump's policies to impact the market. However, Apple is not directly mentioned in the article as being impacted by the events at Davos. Given the indirect nature of the news, I estimate a low probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?' does not contain any specific information related to Apple Inc. This news is more likely to be informational content rather than actionable news affecting the stock price of Apple Inc. There's no indication that this news will have an impact on the financial performance or market sentiment towards the company.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information or developments related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Instead, it discusses the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a broader market index. Given that there is no direct impact on Apple from this news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling remain neutral. This aligns with the previous predictions that also indicated a balanced outlook with no significant influence from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their potential for capital growth, particularly driven by AI. It highlights Apple's new Apple Intelligence software and its potential to drive revenue and device upgrades. While the dividend yield is low, the overall sentiment is positive regarding Apple's future growth prospects. Considering the positive outlook and Apple's strong position in the tech sector, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models being more bullish than others. I will adjust my prediction based on the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, a positive indicator.  Navellier's quantitative approach and strong track record lend credibility to this selection.  The article also cites Apple's strong financial performance and AI integration as positive factors. However, the article tempers this positive sentiment by explicitly stating that Navellier considers other stocks more promising for higher, shorter-term returns.  Apple's 5th place ranking further suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly bullish outlook.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability of a price rise (0.6-0.7) and others more neutral (0.5-0.55). Considering the mixed signals \u2013 positive endorsement but not the top pick, coupled with the generally strong performance of Apple \u2013 a slightly higher probability of a price rise is warranted, but not a dramatic one. The lack of significantly negative news prevents a high probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology, which is expected to benefit from lighter regulation and tax cuts. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is anticipated to gain from reduced regulatory scrutiny and increased investment in AI.

Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and its alignment with these positive trends, the stock is likely to benefit. However, the overall market volatility due to Trump's unpredictable approach could introduce some risk, but the net effect appears positive for Apple. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 estimating higher probabilities for a rise. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses TikTok's temporary shutdown and potential reprieve under President Trump's executive order. While this development does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), it could have indirect implications. The shutdown of TikTok could potentially lead to increased user engagement and activity on other social media platforms, including those owned by Meta (META) and potentially benefiting Google (GOOG) and Apple, given their App Store and ecosystem roles. However, the direct impact on Apple is minimal, as the company's stock movement is generally tied to its own product launches, financial performance, and technological advancements. The positive resolution for TikTok, facilitated by President Trump, might slightly boost investor confidence in companies like Apple, which are not directly involved in the TikTok controversy but could benefit from a more favorable regulatory environment. Given the neutral to slightly positive implications for Apple, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned in the article, the overall sentiment and discussions about AI, tariffs, and Trump's policies could indirectly influence the stock price. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the lack of specific information about Apple, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news. The presence of other CEOs and the potential for market-moving comments suggest some level of uncertainty, but without direct reference to Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
