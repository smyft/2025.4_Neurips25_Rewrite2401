(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information or developments related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Instead, it discusses the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a broader market index. Since there is no direct impact on Apple from this news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling remain neutral. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced outlook with no significant influence from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dividend yields and capital growth potential. While the article highlights that the dividend yields are relatively low, it emphasizes the significant capital appreciation potential driven by AI and other technological advancements. For Apple specifically, the article mentions the launch of Apple Intelligence and its potential to drive software revenue and device upgrades. This positive outlook on Apple's future growth prospects, coupled with the overall positive sentiment surrounding the 'Magnificent Seven,' suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the article also mentions that the Motley Fool analysts identified other stocks that could produce monster returns, which could slightly dampen the enthusiasm for Apple. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks.  Navellier is a respected investor known for his quantitative approach. While the article mentions Apple's strong financial performance and AI integration, it also explicitly states that Navellier considers other stocks more promising for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  Apple's ranking 5th on the list suggests a positive outlook but not an overwhelmingly bullish one. The article's focus on other, potentially more attractive, investments tempers the positive impact of the endorsement. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is low, reflecting the overall market sentiment and the nuanced nature of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under President-elect Donald Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are expected to benefit sectors like technology. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is anticipated to gain from reduced regulatory scrutiny and increased investment in AI. Analysts like Dan Ives from Wedbush predict a favorable environment for tech stocks, with expectations of a 25% rise in 2025. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and its alignment with these positive trends, the stock is likely to benefit. However, the overall market volatility due to Trump's unpredictable approach could introduce some risk, but the net effect appears positive for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential shutdown in the US and the involvement of President Trump and his administration in finding a solution could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. The reason is that if TikTok is banned or shut down, it could lead to an increase in users and engagement on other social media platforms, potentially including Instagram and Facebook, which are owned by companies that compete with TikTok. However, the direct impact on Apple seems minimal as the company's stock movement is generally not directly tied to TikTok's operations but rather to its own ecosystem and product launches. Still, a positive resolution for TikTok could be seen as a broader ecosystem win for Apple, given that TikTok's availability on the App Store is maintained. On the other hand, uncertainty around TikTok's operations and its impact on social media landscape could introduce a neutral to slightly positive bias for companies not directly involved with TikTok, such as Apple, given that TikTok's presence and any potential resolution might not directly influence its stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions that CEOs from various companies, including Apple's competitors, will be in attendance and may make comments about their businesses and the economy. The article also mentions the potential for Trump's policies to impact the market. However, Apple is not directly mentioned in the article as being impacted by the events at Davos. Given the indirect nature of the news, I estimate a low probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?' does not contain any specific information related to Apple Inc. This news is more likely to be informational content rather than actionable news affecting the stock price of Apple Inc. There's no indication that this news will have an impact on the financial performance or market sentiment towards the company.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any specific information or developments related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Instead, it discusses the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a broader market index. Given that there is no direct impact on Apple from this news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling remain neutral. This aligns with the previous predictions that also indicated a balanced outlook with no significant influence from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their potential for capital growth, particularly driven by AI. It highlights Apple's new Apple Intelligence software and its potential to drive revenue and device upgrades. While the dividend yield is low, the overall sentiment is positive regarding Apple's future growth prospects. Considering the positive outlook and Apple's strong position in the tech sector, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models being more bullish than others. I will adjust my prediction based on the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, a positive indicator.  Navellier's quantitative approach and strong track record lend credibility to this selection.  The article also cites Apple's strong financial performance and AI integration as positive factors. However, the article tempers this positive sentiment by explicitly stating that Navellier considers other stocks more promising for higher, shorter-term returns.  Apple's 5th place ranking further suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly bullish outlook.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability of a price rise (0.6-0.7) and others more neutral (0.5-0.55). Considering the mixed signals \u2013 positive endorsement but not the top pick, coupled with the generally strong performance of Apple \u2013 a slightly higher probability of a price rise is warranted, but not a dramatic one. The lack of significantly negative news prevents a high probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology, which is expected to benefit from lighter regulation and tax cuts.

Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 estimating higher probabilities for a rise. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses TikTok's temporary shutdown and potential reprieve under President Trump's executive order. While this development does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), it could have indirect implications. The shutdown of TikTok could potentially lead to increased user engagement and activity on other social media platforms, including those owned by Meta (META) and potentially benefiting Google (GOOG) and Apple, given their App Store and ecosystem roles. However, the direct impact on Apple is minimal, as the company's stock movement is generally tied to its own product launches, financial performance, and technological advancements. The positive resolution for TikTok, facilitated by President Trump, might slightly boost investor confidence in companies like Apple, which are not directly involved in the TikTok controversy but could benefit from a more favorable regulatory environment. Given the neutral to slightly positive implications for Apple, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned in the article, the overall sentiment and discussions about AI, tariffs, and Trump's policies could indirectly influence the stock price. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the lack of specific information about Apple, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news. The presence of other CEOs and the potential for market-moving comments suggest some level of uncertainty, but without direct reference to Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
