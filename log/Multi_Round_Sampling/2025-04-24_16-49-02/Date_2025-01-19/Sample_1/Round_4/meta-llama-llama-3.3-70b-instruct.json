(AAPL): \u2018I Think When You Say Stuff Like Nothing\u2019s Been Done Since Steve Jobs Died, I Think That\u2019s An Ill-advised Strategy To Take I Think\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. .\u00a0 .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics giant that earns billions of dollars through its iconic iPhone. The smartphone is also a central part of its hypothesis as half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue comes from it. The firm's reliance on the iPhone and its closed ecosystem came under fire from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hadn't innovated since the death of its iconic founder Steve Jobs. Cramer took aim at these and other comments made by Zuckerberg:\n\n\"[On Zuckerberg saying Apple hasn't done anything since the iPhone] I. . [laughs hysterically] don't know what to say. I mean, David, look, I don't want to make it too central an issue because it was a love fest, a libertarian love fest, uh but David the one thing [that] is absolutely certain was that if you really want to say the most horrible things about Apple, you say first of all that nothing's been done since Jobs, two that they lock out everything, three that they make every single innovation, hold it.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's temporary shutdown and the potential for a reprieve from Trump introduces uncertainty in the tech landscape, particularly affecting companies like Apple that host the app. While there is a possibility that TikTok could be reinstated, the ongoing legal and political challenges may create volatility. Additionally, if TikTok remains banned, competitors like Meta could benefit, which may indirectly affect Apple's stock due to shifts in advertising revenue. Given the mixed signals and potential for regulatory challenges, the probabilities of stock price movement are balanced but lean slightly towards a fall due to the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content are about the Nasdaq Composite Index, not directly about Apple's performance or any company-specific events. While Apple is a component of the Nasdaq, general information about the index itself is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in either direction. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to equal, reflecting a neutral impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the potential impact of a second Trump term on various sectors.  While the article highlights a generally positive outlook for the market due to deregulation and tax cuts, the impact on Apple is less directly addressed. The article mentions that Big Tech companies, including Apple, are attempting to gain favor with the new administration through campaign contributions.  This suggests a potential for positive relations, but doesn't guarantee a stock price increase.  The article's overall tone is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging potential market volatility.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the impact is likely to be moderate, not dramatic. The lack of specific mention of Apple's prospects beyond the general Big Tech optimism makes a strong prediction difficult.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach to stock selection add credibility to the recommendation. The company reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health. Additionally, Apple's advancements in AI, such as improved Siri and the Apple Neural Engine, along with its commitment to sustainability, position it well for future growth. Given these positive factors and the endorsement by a prominent investor, the stock is likely to experience upward momentum in the short to medium term. However, market conditions and broader economic factors could introduce some volatility, though the probability of a fall is lower compared to the rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The event features various influential CEOs and economic experts, including those from Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia. The discussions at Davos may lead to market-moving insights on AI, tariffs, and interest rates. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is not directly mentioned. The news focuses on the overall market sentiment and potential policy changes under the Trump administration that could affect Apple's competitors or the market as a whole. Given that there is no specific news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the provided content, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement will be more related to the general market trends and reactions to the Davos discussions rather than company-specific news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling seems relatively neutral, but with a slight inclination towards a positive outlook due to the general optimism around tech and AI discussions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Cramer criticized Zuckerberg's remarks about Apple, stating that saying nothing has been done since Steve Jobs' death is an 'ill-advised strategy'. However, the article does not provide any significant negative news about Apple's current performance or future prospects. In fact, Cramer's comments can be seen as a defense of Apple against Zuckerberg's criticism. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact stock price movements. While institutional ownership suggests strong backing and analyst support, insider sales indicate a lack of confidence among insiders. The combined effect of these factors suggests moderate uncertainty in the stock's short-term direction.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's temporary shutdown and the potential for a reprieve from Trump introduces significant uncertainty in the tech landscape, particularly affecting companies like Apple that host the app. While there is a possibility that TikTok could be reinstated, the ongoing legal and political challenges may create volatility.

While Apple is a component of the Nasdaq, information about the index itself is unlikely to have a direct and significant impact on Apple's stock price. The previous round's predictions varied, with some models assigning a neutral impact and others leaning slightly positive or negative based on broader market trends or tangential information. Considering the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I will assign probabilities close to neutral, but slightly favoring a rise due to the general positive sentiment often associated with index discussions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broad market impact of a potential second Trump term, mentioning Apple only within the context of Big Tech's efforts to cultivate positive relations with the administration through campaign contributions.  While the article suggests a generally positive outlook for the market due to deregulation and potential tax cuts, this positive sentiment is not specifically tied to Apple's performance or prospects. The article highlights potential benefits for the tech sector from reduced regulation and increased AI investment, which could positively impact Apple. However, the lack of company-specific news and the overall cautious tone of the article, acknowledging potential market volatility, prevents a strong prediction in either direction. Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.4 to 0.75 probability of a rise, and the lack of direct Apple-specific news in this article, a moderate probability of a rise is assigned, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach to stock selection add credibility to the recommendation. Apple reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health. Additionally, Apple's advancements in AI, such as improved Siri and the Apple Neural Engine, along with its commitment to sustainability, position it well for future growth. Given these positive factors and the endorsement by a prominent investor, the stock is likely to experience upward momentum in the short to medium term. However, market conditions and broader economic factors could introduce some volatility. Previous predictions from other models also show a generally positive sentiment, with most favoring a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend towards a slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models indicating a higher probability of a rise due to the general optimism around tech and AI discussions. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales at Apple Inc., which can impact stock price movements. The large stake held by institutions suggests strong backing and analyst support, which could lead to increased confidence in the stock. However, insider sales indicate a lack of confidence among insiders, potentially leading to downward pressure on the stock price. The news also points out that a considerable portion of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders, making the stock susceptible to their trading decisions. The recent sales by insiders might instill caution among investors. Considering the mixed signals from institutional support and insider actions, the overall impact on the stock price is moderately uncertain.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's temporary shutdown and the potential for a reprieve from Trump introduces significant uncertainty in the tech landscape, particularly affecting companies like Apple that host the app. While there is a possibility that TikTok could be reinstated, the ongoing legal and political challenges may create volatility.

While Apple is a component of the Nasdaq, this type of news is unlikely to cause significant price movement. Previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning slightly positive due to general market optimism, while others remain neutral.

Apple is mentioned within the context of Big Tech's efforts to cultivate positive relations with the administration. While this suggests potential benefits from reduced regulation and increased AI investment, the impact on Apple is indirect and not explicitly stated. The article also highlights potential risks to other sectors (automakers, retailers, construction) which could indirectly affect market sentiment.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities for a price rise (0.4 to 0.75), and the lack of direct Apple-specific news, a moderate probability of a rise is assigned, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging potential market volatility.  The previous predictions show a trend towards a slightly positive outlook for Apple, but with significant variation.  Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect this uncertainty and the lack of direct Apple-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.
