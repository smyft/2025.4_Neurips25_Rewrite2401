(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's temporary shutdown and the potential for a reprieve from Trump introduces uncertainty in the tech landscape, particularly affecting companies like Apple that host the app. While there is a possibility that TikTok could be reinstated, the ongoing legal and political challenges may create volatility. Additionally, if TikTok remains banned, competitors like Meta could benefit, which may indirectly affect Apple's stock due to shifts in advertising revenue. Given the mixed signals and potential for regulatory challenges, the probabilities of stock price movement are balanced but lean slightly towards a fall due to the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content are about the Nasdaq Composite Index, not directly about Apple's performance or any company-specific events. While Apple is a component of the Nasdaq, general information about the index itself is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in either direction. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to equal, reflecting a neutral impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the potential impact of a second Trump term on various sectors.  While the article highlights a generally positive outlook for the market due to deregulation and tax cuts, the impact on Apple is less directly addressed. The article mentions that Big Tech companies, including Apple, are attempting to gain favor with the new administration through campaign contributions.  This suggests a potential for positive relations, but doesn't guarantee a stock price increase.  The article's overall tone is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging potential market volatility.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the impact is likely to be moderate, not dramatic. The lack of specific mention of Apple's prospects beyond the general Big Tech optimism makes a strong prediction difficult.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach to stock selection add credibility to the recommendation. The company reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health. Additionally, Apple's advancements in AI, such as improved Siri and the Apple Neural Engine, along with its commitment to sustainability, position it well for future growth. Given these positive factors and the endorsement by a prominent investor, the stock is likely to experience upward momentum in the short to medium term. However, market conditions and broader economic factors could introduce some volatility, though the probability of a fall is lower compared to the rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The event features various influential CEOs and economic experts, including those from Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia. The discussions at Davos may lead to market-moving insights on AI, tariffs, and interest rates. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is not directly mentioned. The news focuses on the overall market sentiment and potential policy changes under the Trump administration that could affect Apple's competitors or the market as a whole. Given that there is no specific news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the provided content, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement will be more related to the general market trends and reactions to the Davos discussions rather than company-specific news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling seems relatively neutral, but with a slight inclination towards a positive outlook due to the general optimism around tech and AI discussions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Cramer criticized Zuckerberg's remarks about Apple, stating that saying nothing has been done since Steve Jobs' death is an 'ill-advised strategy'. However, the article does not provide any significant negative news about Apple's current performance or future prospects. In fact, Cramer's comments can be seen as a defense of Apple against Zuckerberg's criticism. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact stock price movements. While institutional ownership suggests strong backing and analyst support, insider sales indicate a lack of confidence among insiders. The combined effect of these factors suggests moderate uncertainty in the stock's short-term direction.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's temporary shutdown and the potential for a reprieve from Trump introduces significant uncertainty in the tech landscape, particularly affecting companies like Apple that host the app. While there is a possibility that TikTok could be reinstated, the ongoing legal and political challenges may create volatility. Additionally, if TikTok remains banned, competitors like Meta could benefit, which may indirectly affect Apple's stock due to shifts in advertising revenue.

While Apple is a component of the Nasdaq, information about the index itself is unlikely to have a direct and significant impact on Apple's stock price. The previous round's predictions varied, with some models assigning a neutral impact and others leaning slightly positive or negative based on broader market trends or tangential information. Considering the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I will assign probabilities close to neutral, but slightly favoring a rise due to the general positive sentiment often associated with index discussions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broad market impact of a potential second Trump term, mentioning Apple only within the context of Big Tech's efforts to cultivate positive relations with the administration through campaign contributions.  While the article suggests a generally positive outlook for the market due to deregulation and potential tax cuts, this positive sentiment is not specifically tied to Apple's performance or prospects. The article highlights potential benefits for the tech sector from reduced regulation and increased AI investment, which could positively impact Apple. However, the lack of company-specific news and the overall cautious tone of the article, acknowledging potential market volatility, prevents a strong prediction in either direction. Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.4 to 0.75 probability of a rise, and the lack of direct Apple-specific news in this article, a moderate probability of a rise is assigned, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach to stock selection add credibility to the recommendation. Apple reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health.

Given these positive factors and the endorsement by a prominent investor, the stock is likely to experience upward momentum in the short to medium term. However, market conditions and broader economic factors could introduce some volatility. Previous predictions from other models also show a generally positive sentiment, with most favoring a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Cramer criticized Zuckerberg's remarks about Apple, stating that saying nothing has been done since Steve Jobs' death is an 'ill-advised strategy'. However, the article does not provide any significant negative news about Apple's current performance or future prospects. In fact, Cramer's comments can be seen as a defense of Apple against Zuckerberg's criticism. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend towards a slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models indicating a higher probability of a rise due to the general optimism around tech and AI discussions. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales at Apple Inc., which can impact stock price movements. The large stake held by institutions suggests strong backing and analyst support, which could lead to increased confidence in the stock. However, insider sales indicate a lack of confidence among insiders, potentially leading to downward pressure on the stock price. The news also points out that a considerable portion of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders, making the stock susceptible to their trading decisions. The recent sales by insiders might instill caution among investors. Considering the mixed signals from institutional support and insider actions, the overall impact on the stock price is moderately uncertain.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
