(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, which suggests a positive outlook from a respected investor known for identifying high-growth stocks. The company's strong financial performance, including a year-over-year revenue increase and advancements in AI technology, further supports a bullish sentiment. Additionally, the focus on sustainability and environmental responsibility may attract socially conscious investors. However, the article also mentions that there are stocks with potentially higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dividend yields and capital growth potential. While the article highlights that the dividend yields are relatively low, it emphasizes the significant capital appreciation potential driven by AI and other technological advancements. For Apple specifically, the article mentions the launch of Apple Intelligence and its potential to drive software revenue and device upgrades. This positive outlook on Apple's future growth prospects, coupled with the overall positive sentiment surrounding the 'Magnificent Seven,' suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the article also mentions that the Motley Fool analysts identified other stocks that could produce monster returns, which could slightly dampen the enthusiasm for Apple. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law.  While the initial shutdown might have seemed positive for Apple (as it removed a competitor from the App Store), the subsequent restoration, driven by Trump's intervention, negates this positive impact.  The uncertainty surrounding the future of TikTok in the US, coupled with the legal challenges and political infighting, creates a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple.  Apple's direct involvement is limited to hosting TikTok on its App Store; the potential for fines if they don't comply with the law is a risk, but Trump's statement offering protection reduces this risk significantly.  The overall impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely minimal.  The potential benefit to Meta (Facebook) from a permanent TikTok ban is mentioned, but this is not directly relevant to Apple's stock price movement. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of broader market and economic issues, including California wildfires, interest rates, and Mark Zuckerberg's critical remarks about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs. While Zuckerberg's comments could be seen as negative for Apple's reputation, the article does not provide concrete evidence of immediate financial or operational impact on Apple. Cramer's reaction to Zuckerberg's remarks was mixed, but he did not suggest any fundamental changes in Apple's business outlook. Given Apple's strong market position and the lack of direct negative financial implications from the news, the stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected. However, the slight negative sentiment from Zuckerberg's comments might introduce minor downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional owners, with 61% of the shares owned by institutions. This indicates that the stock price may be vulnerable to the trading decisions of these institutional owners. However, it also suggests that the company is well-regarded by analysts and institutional investors, which could be a positive factor for the stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that the top 25 shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. Considering these factors, the news is relatively neutral and does not provide a strong indication of a significant stock price movement in either direction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news is more focused on upcoming IPOs rather than providing any specific information or impact on Apple. Without direct correlation, it's unlikely that this news would have a significant immediate effect on Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
