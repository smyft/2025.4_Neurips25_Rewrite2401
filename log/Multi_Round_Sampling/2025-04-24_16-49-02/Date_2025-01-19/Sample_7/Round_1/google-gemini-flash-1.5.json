Here's the Best of the Bunch for Income Investors to Buy Right Now.\nNews Content: Warren Buffett primarily buys large-cap stocks for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. That makes sense because Berkshire has so much money to deploy that smaller companies simply don't move the needle enough for the giant conglomerate.\n\nBecause of this focus on large-cap stocks, you probably won't be surprised that Buffett owns six stocks that are members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI). Which is the best pick of the bunch for income investors right now?\n\nBuffett's Dow six-pack\n\nThe two stocks Buffett has owned the longest are both members of the Dow. Buffett initiated a position for Berkshire in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) in 1988. He bought shares of American Express(NYSE: AXP) in 1991. Both Coke and AmEx are \"forever stocks\" for Buffett. In his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, he wrote that the two stocks were among a select group he planned to \"maintain indefinitely.\"\n\nHowever, Buffett thinks another Dow stock is \"an even better business\" than Coca-Cola and American Express. He didn't list Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in the latest shareholder letter as one of the stocks he would own indefinitely. But when asked about the omission by CNBC's Becky Quick at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2024, Buffett sang Apple's praises.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Apple ranks as Berkshire's largest holding, while AmEx is No. 2 and Coke is No. 4. A Dow stock also holds the No. 5 spot -- Chevron(NYSE: CVX). Buffett began aggressively buying the oil stock in the fourth quarter of 2020 after its steep plunge during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBerkshire doesn't have such large stakes in the other two Dow stocks it owns. Both Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Visa(NYSE: V) make up less than 1% of the conglomerate's portfolio.\n\nHow these Dow stocks compare\n\nAmerican Express has been the biggest winner by far over the last 12 months among Buffett's six Dow stocks, with its shares skyrocketing over 70%. Amazon stock has also soared more than 45%. All the others except Coca-Cola have delivered double-digit percentage gains.\n\nDespite its strong performance, American Express' valuation remains more reasonable than most of the others. The financial services giant's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 20.5, lower than Coke's forward P/E of 21.1 and well below the forward earnings multiples of Visa, Apple, and Amazon. Only Chevron has a lower valuation, with its shares trading at 12.6 times forward earnings.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat about earnings growth? Amazon is the clear leader. The e-commerce and cloud services leader reported earnings of $15.3 billion in its latest quarterly update, a year-over-year increase of 55%. None of Buffett's other Dow stocks came close to that level of earnings growth in their most recent quarters.\n\nBuffett probably doesn't care what Wall Street thinks about these stocks. In case you were wondering, though, Coca-Cola appears to be analysts' favorite right now. The consensus 12-month price target for Coke reflects an upside potential of 15%. Wall Street is also relatively bullish about Amazon, Apple, and Chevron.\n\nBest of the bunch for income investors\n\nNow, to answer our initial question: Which of Buffett's Dow stocks is the best pick for income investors? There are two main contenders -- Chevron and Coca-Cola.\n\nWe can scratch Amazon off the list, since it doesn't offer a dividend. Apple, American Express, and Visa probably won't appeal to income investors much either with their paltry forward dividend yields of under 1%.\n\nChevron, though, pays a forward dividend yield of 4.05%. The company has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years. Coca-Cola's yield of 3.1% is lower. However, its track record is even more impressive. The food and beverage maker is a Dividend King, with 62 consecutive dividend increases and counting.\n\nI don't think income investors can go wrong with either Chevron or Coke. However, I think Chevron's higher yield makes it the best of the bunch.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's the Best of the Bunch for Income Investors to Buy Right Now. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, where significant discussions around economic policies, tariffs, and the impact of the new Trump administration are expected. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, any discussions regarding tariffs and economic outlook could directly impact its stock price. The mention of volatility in the markets and the potential for executive orders from Trump could create uncertainty, which may lead to a cautious sentiment among investors. However, the focus on AI and tech innovation could also provide a positive outlook for companies like Apple, which is heavily invested in these areas. Overall, the mixed signals from the news suggest a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to potential positive developments in tech discussions, but the uncertainty surrounding political factors leads to a notable probability of a price fall as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and potential market-moving events related to Trump's inauguration, interest rate outlook from bank CEOs, tariff implications, AI developments, and crypto trends. While Apple (AAPL) isn't directly mentioned as a key player in these discussions, the overall market sentiment and potential policy changes discussed at Davos could indirectly impact Apple. The article mentions the 'Magnificent 7' being potentially 'top-heavy,' which includes Apple. Uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and potential tariffs could negatively affect market sentiment and Apple's global operations. However, positive developments in AI, where Apple is investing, could provide some offset. The article doesn't provide any specific positive catalysts for Apple. Given the mixed signals and general market uncertainty highlighted in the article, a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock price is more likely than a significant rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Warren Buffett's holdings in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, highlighting Apple as Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding. While the article mentions Buffett's praise for Apple, it doesn't directly suggest an imminent price increase.  The article's primary focus is on income-generating stocks, and Apple's low dividend yield makes it less attractive in that context.  The mention of Apple is largely incidental to the main theme. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in either direction.  The probability of a price rise or fall is largely attributed to broader market forces and not this specific news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights the strong performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), driven by their dominance in the technology sector and their role in the AI revolution. Apple is specifically mentioned as being on track to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers through its extensive device ecosystem, which could drive future revenue growth. The article also notes that while dividends from these stocks are modest, their capital growth potential remains high. Given the positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strategic positioning, the stock is likely to benefit from continued investor confidence. However, the modest dividend yield might not significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Overall, the news is bullish for Apple's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.02, Reasoning: The news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any specific information that could be considered directly relevant to Apple's stock price. The content appears to be a general overview of upcoming IPOs and does not contain any company-specific news or announcements about Apple. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low, but given the lack of negative information, a slight bias towards stability or a minor positive reaction could be considered.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not contain any information that is directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its current financial situation. The news appears to be about upcoming initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025, which does not provide any specific insight into Apple's stock performance. As a result, it is unlikely that this news will have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including Trump policies, tariffs, AI developments, and cryptocurrency trends. These factors significantly influence the stock market, especially large market players like Apple Inc. The report indicates potential volatility and uncertainty, which can affect stock prices. However, Apple's diversified portfolio and strong market position may mitigate the impact of these factors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
