(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, where significant discussions around economic policies, tariffs, and AI are expected. While the focus is on various sectors and companies, the mention of potential volatility in the markets and the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies could create a cautious sentiment among investors. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is generally viewed as a strong company with a solid market position, which may mitigate some negative impacts. Given the mixed signals from the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's resilience and strong fundamentals, but also acknowledge the potential for a decline due to market volatility and external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). It discusses IPOs, which are initial public offerings of other companies. While Apple's performance might be indirectly affected by the overall market sentiment surrounding IPOs, the connection is weak. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. A slight positive sentiment might arise if the IPO market is expected to be strong, indicating a healthy investment environment, but this is a very indirect and weak signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025\", is completely irrelevant to Apple Inc.  Apple is already a publicly traded company; therefore, this news item has virtually no impact on its stock price.  Any price movement would be due to other market factors and not this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including technology, banking, retail, and crypto. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7,' the article does not provide specific information about Apple that would directly influence its stock price. The broader market sentiment discussed includes potential volatility due to Trump policies, interest rate outlooks, and AI developments, but these are not Apple-specific. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral or minimal based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks. Navellier is a well-known investor with a successful track record in growth investing. He emphasizes strong growth characteristics and sound fundamentals. Apple has shown robust financial performance with a 6% increase in revenue and a 15% increase in operating income year-over-year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Additionally, Apple's integration of AI innovations and commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing are positive factors. Being ranked 5th on Navellier's list and having a significant stake by Navellier & Associates ($13.4 million) could boost investor confidence. Overall, the positive outlook and prominent investor endorsement are likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Cramer criticized Zuckerberg's comments that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs' death, calling it an 'ill-advised strategy'. The article also mentions the California wildfires and their potential impact on the economy. However, the main focus is on Cramer's defense of Apple and his criticism of Zuckerberg's comments. Given that Cramer is a well-known financial expert and his comments can influence investor sentiment, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential impact on TikTok's operations in the U.S. and the involvement of Apple (AAPL) and other companies in compliance with the new law. The news indicates that TikTok is working towards restoring service after going dark. While this situation may affect the stock price of companies like Apple, which hosts TikTok in its app store, the direct impact on Apple's stock might be minimal since the event primarily affects TikTok. The broader market sentiment, regulatory actions, and long-term impacts need consideration.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, where significant discussions around economic policies, tariffs, and AI are expected.

However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is generally viewed as a strong company with a solid market position, which may mitigate some negative impacts. The mixed signals from the news suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's resilience and strong fundamentals, but there is also a notable risk of decline due to market volatility and external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline is about upcoming IPOs in 2025. This is largely irrelevant to Apple, a well-established, publicly traded company. The previous rounds of predictions reflect this, with most models assigning a near-neutral impact. Some models initially considered indirect effects (market sentiment), but the consensus is that the direct impact is minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance and the previous rounds' assessments, I'll maintain a neutral stance, but slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect the slight positive sentiment that a healthy IPO market might indicate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a neutral probability (0.5 rise/0.5 fall) because of the news' irrelevance. Others considered broader market sentiment or other unrelated news impacting Apple, leading to varied predictions.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the most reasonable prediction is that the news will have minimal impact on Apple's stock price. Any movement would be driven by other factors, not this specific news about upcoming IPOs.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including technology, banking, retail, and crypto.

Previous predictions also suggest a mixed outlook, with some models indicating a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong fundamentals, while others suggest minimal impact from the news. Considering the lack of direct impact and mixed sentiment, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is fairly balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing its robust financial performance, AI innovations, and commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing. Navellier's endorsement and the company's strong fundamentals are likely to boost investor confidence. However, the impact of this news on the stock price may be moderate as it doesn't introduce new information but rather reinforces existing positive views on the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

While Apple's direct involvement might seem limited, the potential regulatory issues surrounding TikTok could create broader market uncertainties. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions, the current analysis leans towards a slight caution due to market uncertainties and potential regulatory actions impacting the overall market.

Apple is an established company, and the news about other companies' IPOs has minimal direct impact.  The previous predictions show a wide range, with most models converging towards a neutral stance (0.5 probability for rise and fall).  Some models considered indirect effects like overall market sentiment, but these are weak and uncertain.  The lack of direct relevance and the consensus from previous predictions strongly suggest that this news will not significantly affect Apple's stock price.

The article provides specific details about Apple's positive financials, such as a 6% increase in revenue and a 15% increase in operating income year-over-year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Additionally, Apple's integration of AI innovations and commitment to using 100% recycled cobalt in all batteries designed by Apple by 2025 are noted as positive factors.
