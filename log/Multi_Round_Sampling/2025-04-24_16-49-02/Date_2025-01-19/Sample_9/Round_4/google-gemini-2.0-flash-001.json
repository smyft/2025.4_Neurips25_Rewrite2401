(AAPL): \u2018I Think When You Say Stuff Like Nothing\u2019s Been Done Since Steve Jobs Died, I Think That\u2019s An Ill-advised Strategy To Take I Think\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. .\u00a0 .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics giant that earns billions of dollars through its iconic iPhone. The smartphone is also a central part of its hypothesis as half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue comes from it. The firm's reliance on the iPhone and its closed ecosystem came under fire from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hadn't innovated since the death of its iconic founder Steve Jobs. Cramer took aim at these and other comments made by Zuckerberg:\n\n\"[On Zuckerberg saying Apple hasn't done anything since the iPhone] I. . [laughs hysterically] don't know what to say. I mean, David, look, I don't want to make it too central an issue because it was a love fest, a libertarian love fest, uh but David the one thing [that] is absolutely certain was that if you really want to say the most horrible things about Apple, you say first of all that nothing's been done since Jobs, two that they lock out everything, three that they make every single innovation, hold it.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, where significant discussions around economic policies, tariffs, and AI are expected. While the focus is on various sectors and companies, the mention of potential volatility in the markets and the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies could create a cautious sentiment among investors. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is generally viewed as a strong company with a solid market position, which may mitigate some negative impacts. Given the mixed signals from the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's resilience and strong fundamentals, but also acknowledge the potential for a decline due to market volatility and external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Jim Cramer's commentary on various topics, including Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs' death. While Cramer defends Apple, the negative sentiment expressed by Zuckerberg, a prominent figure, could potentially impact investor perception. However, the article also highlights Apple's strong position and hedge fund interest. The overall impact is mixed, with potential for both positive and negative reactions. The article also mentions Cramer's comments on broader economic issues like interest rates and California wildfires, which could indirectly affect market sentiment but are not directly related to Apple's performance. Given the mixed signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall due to the negative comments about innovation, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also presents a risk.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article lacks specific details about the volume or timing of these sales, making it difficult to quantify their impact.  The overall tone is somewhat neutral, acknowledging both the potential upside and downside risks associated with high institutional ownership.  Given the lack of strongly positive or negative information beyond the inherent risk of concentrated institutional ownership, the probabilities are assigned relatively close to even.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. Institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator due to their access to capital and research capabilities, but it also introduces vulnerability to large-scale sell-offs. The top 25 shareholders hold 41% of the business, indicating concentrated ownership that could amplify market reactions. Recent insider sales might signal caution, but the overall insider ownership is under 1%, limiting its impact. The general public holds 37%, which is substantial but not enough to counter institutional influence. Given these factors, the stock could experience volatility, but the strong institutional backing and historical performance suggest a balanced outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses various market-moving topics at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, including Trump's policies, tariffs, AI, and crypto. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the news. However, the overall tone suggests potential market volatility due to various uncertainties. Given that AAPL is part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks mentioned as looking 'top-heavy,' there might be a cautious outlook. However, without direct mention or specific catalysts for AAPL, the probabilities are relatively balanced but lean slightly towards a cautious stance due to general market conditions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Cramer criticized Zuckerberg's statement that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs' death, calling it 'ill-advised' and 'one of the most offensive interviews' he's heard. However, the article also mentions that Cramer's comments were part of a broader discussion on various topics, including the California wildfires, interest rates, and the insurance industry. Given the mixed tone of the article and the lack of directly bearish or bullish statements from Cramer, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral. Nevertheless, the criticism from Zuckerberg and Cramer's response may lead to a slight increase in uncertainty and volatility, which could negatively impact the stock price. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including Trump policies, tariffs, AI developments, and cryptocurrency trends. These factors significantly influence the stock market, especially large market-cap stocks like those in the 'Magnificent 7' (including Apple Inc.). The news hints at market volatility and increased uncertainty, which could impact investor sentiment negatively. However, Apple Inc., being a strong, diversified company, might mitigate some of these impacts.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, where significant discussions around economic policies, tariffs, and AI are expected. While there are concerns about market volatility and uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies, Apple Inc. is generally viewed as a strong company with solid fundamentals. The mention of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks looking top-heavy suggests caution, but Apple's resilience and strong institutional backing may mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the mixed signals lead to a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but the potential for a decline due to market volatility is also acknowledged.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple, stating that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs' death. While Cramer defends Apple, the fact that a prominent figure like Zuckerberg made such a statement could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Cramer's defense and the article's mention of Apple's strong position and hedge fund interest provide some counterweight. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to the negative comments, while others are more neutral. Considering the negative sentiment from Zuckerberg and the mixed reactions from previous predictions, I believe there's a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling, but not drastically so, as Cramer defends Apple and the company has strong fundamentals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. This is a double-edged sword. While it suggests confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of a sharp price drop if these institutions decide to sell simultaneously.  The mention of recent insider sales adds to the negative sentiment, although the lack of specifics limits the impact assessment.  The overall picture is one of potential volatility, with the risk of a price fall outweighing the potential for a rise, given the concentrated ownership and the negative signal from insider selling.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price fall in several models. Considering the inherent risk associated with high institutional ownership and the lack of strong positive catalysts, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions.

Therefore, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the high institutional ownership of Apple (61%), highlighting both the potential upside (institutional confidence) and downside (risk of coordinated selling).  The mention of recent insider sales adds a negative element, although the lack of specifics limits its impact.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight tendency towards a price fall.  While high institutional ownership is generally positive, the concentration of ownership and the potential for large-scale sell-offs outweigh the positive aspects in this specific context. The lack of other significant positive news further contributes to a cautious outlook. Considering the inherent risks associated with concentrated institutional ownership and the negative signal from insider selling, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which is a double-edged sword.

The article also mentions Cramer's broader views on economic issues and the California wildfires, which could indirectly affect market sentiment. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with a slight trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the negative sentiment from Zuckerberg and the mixed reactions from previous predictions, I believe there's a higher chance of the stock price falling. However, Cramer's defense and Apple's strong fundamentals provide some counterweight. Given the slightly increasing negative sentiment in previous rounds, I will adjust my prediction to reflect this trend, but not drastically, as Apple is a fundamentally strong company.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Jim Cramer on Apple Inc.
