(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, where significant discussions around economic policies, tariffs, and AI are expected. While the focus is on various sectors and companies, the mention of potential volatility in the markets and the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies could create a cautious sentiment among investors. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is generally viewed as a strong company with a solid market position, which may mitigate some negative impacts. Given the mixed signals from the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's resilience and strong fundamentals, but also acknowledge the potential for a decline due to market volatility and external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Jim Cramer's commentary on various topics, including Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs' death. While Cramer defends Apple, the negative sentiment expressed by Zuckerberg, a prominent figure, could potentially impact investor perception. However, the article also highlights Apple's strong position and hedge fund interest. The overall impact is mixed, with potential for both positive and negative reactions. The article also mentions Cramer's comments on broader economic issues like interest rates and California wildfires, which could indirectly affect market sentiment but are not directly related to Apple's performance. Given the mixed signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall due to the negative comments about innovation, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also presents a risk.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article lacks specific details about the volume or timing of these sales, making it difficult to quantify their impact.  The overall tone is somewhat neutral, acknowledging both the potential upside and downside risks associated with high institutional ownership.  Given the lack of strongly positive or negative information beyond the inherent risk of concentrated institutional ownership, the probabilities are assigned relatively close to even.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. Institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator due to their access to capital and research capabilities, but it also introduces vulnerability to large-scale sell-offs. The top 25 shareholders hold 41% of the business, indicating concentrated ownership that could amplify market reactions. Recent insider sales might signal caution, but the overall insider ownership is under 1%, limiting its impact. The general public holds 37%, which is substantial but not enough to counter institutional influence. Given these factors, the stock could experience volatility, but the strong institutional backing and historical performance suggest a balanced outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses various market-moving topics at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, including Trump's policies, tariffs, AI, and crypto. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the news. However, the overall tone suggests potential market volatility due to various uncertainties. Given that AAPL is part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks mentioned as looking 'top-heavy,' there might be a cautious outlook. However, without direct mention or specific catalysts for AAPL, the probabilities are relatively balanced but lean slightly towards a cautious stance due to general market conditions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Cramer criticized Zuckerberg's statement that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs' death, calling it 'ill-advised' and 'one of the most offensive interviews' he's heard. However, the article also mentions that Cramer's comments were part of a broader discussion on various topics, including the California wildfires, interest rates, and the insurance industry. Given the mixed tone of the article and the lack of directly bearish or bullish statements from Cramer, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral. Nevertheless, the criticism from Zuckerberg and Cramer's response may lead to a slight increase in uncertainty and volatility, which could negatively impact the stock price. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including Trump policies, tariffs, AI developments, and cryptocurrency trends. These factors significantly influence the stock market, especially large market-cap stocks like those in the 'Magnificent 7' (including Apple Inc.). The news hints at market volatility and increased uncertainty, which could impact investor sentiment negatively. However, Apple Inc., being a strong, diversified company, might mitigate some of these impacts.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, where significant discussions around economic policies, tariffs, and AI are expected. While there are concerns about market volatility and uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies, Apple Inc. is generally viewed as a strong company with solid fundamentals. The mention of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks looking top-heavy suggests caution, but Apple's resilience and strong institutional backing may mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the mixed signals lead to a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but the potential for a decline due to market volatility is also acknowledged.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple, stating that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs' death. While Cramer defends Apple, the fact that a prominent figure like Zuckerberg made such a statement could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Cramer's defense and the article's mention of Apple's strong position and hedge fund interest provide some counterweight. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to the negative comments, while others are more neutral. Considering the negative sentiment from Zuckerberg and the mixed reactions from previous predictions, I believe there's a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling, but not drastically so, as Cramer defends Apple and the company has strong fundamentals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. This is a double-edged sword. While it suggests confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of a sharp price drop if these institutions decide to sell simultaneously.  The mention of recent insider sales adds to the negative sentiment, although the lack of specifics limits the impact assessment.  The overall picture is one of potential volatility, with the risk of a price fall outweighing the potential for a rise, given the concentrated ownership and the negative signal from insider selling.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price fall in several models. Considering the inherent risk associated with high institutional ownership and the lack of strong positive catalysts, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions.

Therefore, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the high institutional ownership of Apple (61%), highlighting both the potential upside (institutional confidence) and downside (risk of coordinated selling).  The mention of recent insider sales adds a negative element, although the lack of specifics limits its impact.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight tendency towards a price fall.  While high institutional ownership is generally positive, the concentration of ownership and the potential for large-scale sell-offs outweigh the positive aspects in this specific context. The lack of other significant positive news further contributes to a cautious outlook.
