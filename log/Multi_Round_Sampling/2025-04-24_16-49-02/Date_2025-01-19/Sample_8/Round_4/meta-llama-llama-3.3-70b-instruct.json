(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, which suggests a positive outlook from a respected investor known for identifying high-growth stocks. The company's strong financial performance, including a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, further supports a bullish sentiment. Additionally, Apple's advancements in AI and commitment to sustainability may enhance its market position. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). It discusses IPOs, which are initial public offerings of other companies. While Apple's performance might be indirectly affected by the overall market sentiment surrounding IPOs, the connection is weak. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. A slight positive sentiment might arise if the IPO market is expected to be strong, indicating a healthy investment environment, but this is a very indirect and weak signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including banking, retail, AI, and crypto.  While Apple (AAPL) isn't directly mentioned, the article highlights several factors that could indirectly influence its stock price.  The \"Magnificent 7\" (which includes Apple) are described as looking \"top-heavy,\" suggesting a potential for a price correction.  Increased market volatility and uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies are also mentioned, which could negatively affect tech stocks like Apple.  The focus on AI and the potential for competition from other tech giants in developing AI chips could also create some uncertainty for Apple's future growth in this sector.  However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product portfolio offer some resilience against negative market sentiment.  Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content are about upcoming IPOs in 2025, which does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not contain any information that would impact Apple's stock price, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal. The stock price movement is likely to be influenced by other factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investments in six Dow Jones stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article does not provide specific news about Apple's financial performance or future outlook, it mentions that Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding and that Buffett has praised the company. However, the article focuses more on income investing and recommends Chevron and Coca-Cola for their dividend yields. Apple's dividend yield is described as 'paltry' at under 1%. The neutral to positive tone towards Apple, combined with its significant holding by Berkshire Hathaway, might maintain or slightly boost investor confidence. However, the lack of specific positive news about Apple's financials or future plans could limit significant stock price movement. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is relatively low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown of TikTok in the US due to a new law banning the app, and the potential for President Trump to issue an executive order to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect. The article also mentions that Apple and Google have taken steps to comply with the law, but Trump's assurances may not guarantee that his administration won't enforce the law in the future. Given that Apple is one of the companies involved in the compliance, the news may have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as the company is taking steps to comply with the law and may benefit from the potential demise of a competitor. However, the overall impact is likely to be small, as the news is more relevant to TikTok and its parent company ByteDance than to Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news is more focused on upcoming IPOs rather than providing any specific information or impact on Apple. Without direct correlation, it's unlikely that this news would have a significant immediate effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s inclusion in Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, which suggests a positive outlook from a respected investor known for identifying high-growth stocks. The company's strong financial performance, including a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, further supports a bullish sentiment.

Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is significantly higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on upcoming IPOs in 2025 and doesn't directly mention or impact Apple (AAPL). Most models in the previous round correctly identified this lack of direct relevance, resulting in low probabilities for both rise and fall. The initial model's high prediction of a price rise seems to be based on unrelated positive information about Apple, which is not relevant to the provided news. Therefore, I will assign low probabilities to both rise and fall, reflecting the news's negligible impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors. While Apple isn't directly mentioned, several factors could indirectly influence its stock price. The article highlights concerns about the 'Magnificent 7,' including Apple, appearing 'top-heavy,' suggesting a potential price correction. Increased market volatility and uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies are also mentioned, which could negatively affect tech stocks. The focus on AI and potential competition could create uncertainty for Apple's future growth in this sector. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product portfolio offer some resilience.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to unrelated positive news about Apple in other sources, while others see a higher probability of a fall due to the general market uncertainty highlighted in this Davos news. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the overall market uncertainty, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, reflecting the potential for a correction in the tech sector and the general uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The content focuses on IPOs of other companies, which has no immediate or direct impact on Apple's stock price. Previous predictions from various models also indicate minimal to no effect, with most models assigning low probabilities to both rising and falling stock prices due to this news. Given the lack of direct relevance and the consensus among previous predictions, the stock price movement is likely to be unaffected by this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investments in six Dow Jones stocks, including Apple Inc.

(AAPL). The news primarily focuses on IPOs of other companies, which may have an indirect impact on the broader market sentiment. While a strong IPO market can positively influence overall market conditions, the connection to Apple's stock price is weak. Previous models' predictions varied widely, but most indicated little to no direct impact on Apple's stock price due to the weak linkage with the news content.

The consensus among the models suggests that the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate effect on Apple's stock price.

Considering the consensus from previous rounds, the probability of either a rise or fall directly attributable to this news is minimal. I will slightly increase the probability of a rise to 0.25 to account for the possibility that a strong IPO market could indirectly signal a healthy investment environment, which could have a small positive impact on Apple's stock.
