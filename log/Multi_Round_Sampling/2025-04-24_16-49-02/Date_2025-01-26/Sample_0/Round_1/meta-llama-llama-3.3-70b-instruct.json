(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures. This stance may resonate positively with investors who value corporate responsibility and social governance, potentially leading to a favorable perception of the company. However, the political climate and the potential for backlash from conservative groups could create uncertainty. Overall, the strong support for DEI from Apple and its alignment with other major firms like Costco may bolster investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in a dividend-paying stock.  While the article doesn't explicitly name the company, the context strongly suggests it's Apple (given the question 'Is it a buy now?').  Buffett's investment is a strong positive signal, indicating confidence in the company's future performance.  However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted because of the already high valuation of Apple and the fact that this information is not new.  The market is likely already aware of Buffett's significant holdings in Apple. Therefore, while the news is positive, its impact on the stock price is expected to be relatively small. A small price increase is more likely than a significant one, and a price decrease is unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies in corporate America, with some companies backing away from these initiatives due to political and legal pressures, while others like Apple (AAPL) are holding firm. Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR that would assess risks of its DEI programs. The article highlights that Apple positions itself as an equal opportunity employer, which may resonate positively with certain investors and stakeholders who value corporate social responsibility. However, the political climate and potential legal challenges could introduce uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and consistent stance on DEI, the immediate market reaction is likely neutral to slightly positive, as the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or core business operations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggest a negative outlook due to his concerns about the company's upcoming quarter results and its dominance in his portfolio. He mentioned that they sold some stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio and expressed concerns about the company's performance, stating that he thinks the stock will go lower and that there, 'I think it's going to miss. I think they'll miss the quarter.' These statements indicate a potential decrease in stock price as Cramer implies a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.'s short-term performance. However, it's worth noting that Cramer has a history of influencing stock prices with his comments and that his statements can sometimes lead to opposite reactions in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple, as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article notes that the market has had a strong start to the year, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising over 2.8% in the last five days. The tech sector has been leading the gains, with a rise of over 3.1% in the same period. The article also mentions that Trump's initial days in office have been seen as positive for the market, with limited news on tariffs and a massive AI investment announcement helping to boost tech stocks. However, the article also notes that the Fed's decision and the upcoming earnings reports could potentially disrupt the market's momentum. Given the positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position as a leader in the industry, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio. He expressed concern that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. Given these negative sentiments, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
