(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Warren Buffett Has $69.9 Billion Invested in This Dividend-Paying Stock. Is It a Buy Now?\nNews Content: There are many ways to get rich on Wall Street, but none seem as reliable as the strategies employed by Warren Buffett. The legendary investor took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965. Over the past six decades, the stock has delivered a 19.6% average annual gain.\n\nThere aren't any secrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.\n\nWe can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 million Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.\n\nApple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.\n\nWhy Buffett sold heaps of Apple shares\n\nBuffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top of Berkshire's portfolio if he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.\n\nBerkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.AAPL Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.\n\nTrailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.\n\nA mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.\n\nWhy holding some Apple shares is still a good idea\n\nInvestors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue.\u00a0While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.\n\nThe bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.\n\nNot time to buy\n\nApple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It a Buy Now? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures. This stance may resonate positively with investors who value corporate responsibility and social governance, potentially leading to a favorable perception of the company. However, the political climate and the potential for backlash from conservative groups could create uncertainty. Overall, the strong support for DEI from Apple and its alignment with other major firms like Costco may bolster investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in a dividend-paying stock.  While the article doesn't explicitly name the company, the context strongly suggests it's Apple (given the question 'Is it a buy now?').  Buffett's investment is a strong positive signal, indicating confidence in the company's future performance.  However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted because of the already high valuation of Apple and the fact that this information is not new.  The market is likely already aware of Buffett's significant holdings in Apple. Therefore, while the news is positive, its impact on the stock price is expected to be relatively small. A small price increase is more likely than a significant one, and a price decrease is unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies in corporate America, with some companies backing away from these initiatives due to political and legal pressures, while others like Apple (AAPL) are holding firm. Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR that would assess risks of its DEI programs. The article highlights that Apple positions itself as an equal opportunity employer, which may resonate positively with certain investors and stakeholders who value corporate social responsibility. However, the political climate and potential legal challenges could introduce uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and consistent stance on DEI, the immediate market reaction is likely neutral to slightly positive, as the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or core business operations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggest a negative outlook due to his concerns about the company's upcoming quarter results and its dominance in his portfolio. He mentioned that they sold some stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio and expressed concerns about the company's performance, stating that he thinks the stock will go lower and that there, 'I think it's going to miss. I think they'll miss the quarter.' These statements indicate a potential decrease in stock price as Cramer implies a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.'s short-term performance. However, it's worth noting that Cramer has a history of influencing stock prices with his comments and that his statements can sometimes lead to opposite reactions in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple, as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article notes that the market has had a strong start to the year, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising over 2.8% in the last five days. The tech sector has been leading the gains, with a rise of over 3.1% in the same period. The article also mentions that Trump's initial days in office have been seen as positive for the market, with limited news on tariffs and a massive AI investment announcement helping to boost tech stocks. However, the article also notes that the Fed's decision and the upcoming earnings reports could potentially disrupt the market's momentum. Given the positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position as a leader in the industry, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio. He expressed concern that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. Given these negative sentiments, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
