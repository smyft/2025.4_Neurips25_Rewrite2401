(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures. This stance may resonate positively with investors who value corporate responsibility and social governance, potentially leading to a favorable perception of the company. However, the political climate and the potential for backlash from conservative groups could create uncertainty. Overall, the strong support for DEI from Apple and its alignment with other major firms like Costco may bolster investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in a dividend-paying stock.  While the article doesn't explicitly name the company, the context strongly suggests it's Apple (given the question 'Is it a buy now?').  Buffett's investment is a strong positive signal, indicating confidence in the company's future performance.  However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted because of the already high valuation of Apple and the fact that this information is not new.  The market is likely already aware of Buffett's significant holdings in Apple. Therefore, while the news is positive, its impact on the stock price is expected to be relatively small. A small price increase is more likely than a significant one, and a price decrease is unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies in corporate America, with some companies backing away from these initiatives due to political and legal pressures, while others like Apple (AAPL) are holding firm. Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR that would assess risks of its DEI programs. The article highlights that Apple positions itself as an equal opportunity employer, which may resonate positively with certain investors and stakeholders who value corporate social responsibility. However, the political climate and potential legal challenges could introduce uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and consistent stance on DEI, the immediate market reaction is likely neutral to slightly positive, as the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or core business operations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggest a negative outlook due to his concerns about the company's upcoming quarter results and its dominance in his portfolio. He mentioned that they sold some stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio and expressed concerns about the company's performance, stating that he thinks the stock will go lower and that there, 'I think it's going to miss. I think they'll miss the quarter.' These statements indicate a potential decrease in stock price as Cramer implies a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.'s short-term performance. However, it's worth noting that Cramer has a history of influencing stock prices with his comments and that his statements can sometimes lead to opposite reactions in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple, as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article notes that the market has had a strong start to the year, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising over 2.8% in the last five days. The tech sector has been leading the gains, with a rise of over 3.1% in the same period. The article also mentions that Trump's initial days in office have been seen as positive for the market, with limited news on tariffs and a massive AI investment announcement helping to boost tech stocks. However, the article also notes that the Fed's decision and the upcoming earnings reports could potentially disrupt the market's momentum. Given the positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position as a leader in the industry, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio. He expressed concern that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. Given these negative sentiments, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which contrasts with the trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures. This steadfastness may resonate positively with investors who value corporate responsibility and social governance. However, the political climate and potential backlash from conservative groups could introduce some uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and its alignment with other major firms like Costco, there is a likelihood of a positive market reaction, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to external pressures. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a significant probability of it falling due to the broader market context and mixed investor sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple's stock. While Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they've been reducing it due to valuation concerns. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks, but also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business. The conclusion is that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. Considering this, and the previous rounds' predictions leaning towards a negative outlook, I'm estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's substantial investment in a dividend-paying stock, strongly implying Apple (AAPL). While this is positive, the impact is likely muted due to the already high valuation and the market's likely awareness of Buffett's holdings.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some highlighting positive factors like Buffett's investment and Apple's DEI stance, while others point to concerns about slowing revenue growth, valuation, and negative analyst comments.  The overall sentiment from previous models is slightly bearish, with a leaning towards a higher probability of a price decrease.  Considering the mixed signals and the likely muted impact of the news itself, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the cautious outlook from several previous analyses and the potential for the market to already be pricing in the positive news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the broader trend of companies retreating from DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies due to political pressures, with some exceptions like Apple (AAPL) and Costco (COST) holding firm. Apple's commitment to DEI, as highlighted in the article, may resonate positively with investors who value corporate social responsibility, potentially boosting investor confidence. However, the political climate and potential legal challenges from conservative groups could introduce uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and consistent stance, the immediate market reaction is likely neutral to slightly positive, as the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or core business operations. The previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a slight rise due to Apple's DEI stance, while others are more cautious due to broader market or valuation concerns. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

These statements indicate a potential decrease in stock price as Cramer implies a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.'s short-term performance. However, it's worth noting that Cramer's statements can sometimes lead to opposite reactions in the market. The mixed signals and overall market performance suggest a slightly cautious approach but with a leaning towards a negative impact on the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple, as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The market has had a strong start to the year, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising over 2.8% in the last five days. The tech sector has been leading the gains, with a rise of over 3.1% in the same period. Trump's initial days in office have been seen as positive for the market, with limited news on tariffs and a massive AI investment announcement helping to boost tech stocks. Given the positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position as a leader in the industry, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling. Additionally, considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly positive to neutral expectations for Apple's stock price movement, which supports the estimation of a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), expressing concerns about the company's upcoming quarter results and suggesting that the stock has become too dominant in his portfolio. He predicts that the stock will miss the quarter and that there might be further analyst downgrades. Several recent predictions from other models also suggest a bearish outlook, particularly influenced by Cramer's comments. Although there are some positive signals such as Apple's strong brand and market presence, the overall negative sentiments dominate the current analysis.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which contrasts with many companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures.

Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some leaning towards a slight rise due to Apple's DEI stance, while others are more cautious due to broader market or valuation concerns. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of it falling due to external pressures and mixed investor sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. While Buffett's large holding is a positive signal, the fact that Berkshire has been significantly reducing its stake raises concerns. The article points to a stretched valuation and slowing revenue growth as reasons for Buffett's sales. However, it also highlights the strength of Apple's services business and its ability to generate substantial free cash flow. The article explicitly states that Apple is 'Not time to buy'. Considering the negative sentiment expressed in the article, the concerns about valuation and growth, and the trend of previous predictions leaning towards a negative outlook, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. The 'Double Down' advertisement is a generic promotion and doesn't significantly influence the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in a dividend-paying stock, strongly suggesting Apple. While this is generally positive, its impact is likely muted due to Apple's already high valuation and the market's likely awareness of Buffett's holdings.  The previous predictions are mixed. Some highlight positive factors like Buffett's investment and Apple's DEI stance, while others point to concerns about slowing revenue growth, valuation, and negative analyst comments from Jim Cramer.  Cramer's comments carry significant weight, as he's known to influence market sentiment.  His bearish outlook, coupled with concerns about Apple's upcoming earnings, significantly contributes to the negative sentiment.  The overall trend in predictions leans slightly bearish, with a higher probability of a price decrease.  Considering the mixed signals and the likely muted impact of the headline news itself, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the cautious outlook from several previous analyses and the potential for the market to already be pricing in the positive news from Buffett's investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures.

(AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio. He also expressed concerns about Apple's upcoming quarter results, suggesting that the company might miss its targets and that there could be further analyst downgrades. These statements from a well-followed market commentator can influence investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in stock price. While Apple has a strong brand and a significant presence in the tech industry, the negative comments from Cramer and the overall market context suggest a cautious outlook. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple, as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision.
