(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) often signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the news does not provide any new information about Apple's performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Overall, the association with Buffett, a well-respected investor, tends to create a favorable outlook for the stock, leading to a higher probability of price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader trend of companies reacting to political pressure regarding DEI initiatives. While Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is highlighted, the article directly mentions Apple (AAPL) facing a similar shareholder proposal. The article states that Apple is defending its DEI stance. This suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI, but also a potential risk if the shareholder proposal gains traction. However, given Costco's overwhelming success (98% support), and the fact that Apple has already stated its position, the risk seems relatively low. The broader market trend of companies retreating from DEI could create some uncertainty, but Apple's firm stance might be viewed favorably by a significant portion of investors, especially those focused on ESG factors. The article also mentions potential legal challenges from Republican-led states, which could introduce some volatility, but this is a broader market concern rather than specific to Apple at this moment. Overall, the news is slightly positive for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio.  While he anticipates Apple missing its quarterly earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's historical performance of rising after downgrades. This creates a mixed signal.  The fact that he's selling some stock suggests a negative outlook in the short term, but his long-term view is more positive. The article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks, indirectly suggesting that he sees better opportunities elsewhere.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is a strong endorsement from one of the most respected investors in the world. Buffett's investment style is long-term and value-oriented, which often attracts positive attention from the market. This news could boost investor confidence in AAPL, leading to increased demand for the stock. However, the news does not provide any new fundamental or financial data about Apple, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Given Buffett's reputation and the size of the investment, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but the effect may not be dramatic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with muted sales and earnings growth expected. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down, and 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days, indicating concerns about Apple's growth trajectory. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock has a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share according to Fair Value models on InvestingPro. Despite these concerns, Apple's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several big tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. The article suggests that Meta Platforms is a stock to buy due to its strong revenue and earnings growth, as well as its aggressive push into AI. In contrast, Apple is considered a stock to sell due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article also mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Meta Platforms' stock price rising is high, while the probability of Apple's stock price falling is also high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment. This endorsement may lead to increased demand for the stock, especially among value-oriented investors. However, the news does not provide new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit the immediate impact. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions, where some analysts express concerns about Apple's growth trajectory and others highlight Buffett's influence, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI in light of a broader trend of companies retreating from such policies due to political pressure. Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is presented as a positive example, and Apple is mentioned as also defending its DEI stance against a similar shareholder proposal. This suggests that Apple is likely to maintain its DEI efforts, which could be viewed favorably by investors who value ESG factors. However, the article also mentions potential legal challenges from Republican-led states, which could introduce some volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on Warren Buffett's investment, while others predicted a fall due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. Given the current news context and the previous predictions, I believe the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's commitment to DEI could be seen as a positive signal, but the potential legal challenges and mixed previous predictions temper the optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling some Apple stock due to its oversized portfolio position is the most impactful piece of information. While he expresses some long-term optimism and acknowledges the stock's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, the immediate action of selling suggests a negative short-term outlook.  His prediction of a missed quarter further reinforces this negative sentiment.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models emphasizing the positive influence of Warren Buffett's investment and others highlighting the negative implications of Cramer's actions and anticipated earnings miss. Considering the weight of Cramer's immediate action and the expectation of a disappointing quarter, the probability of a short-term price fall is higher than a rise. However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, as indicated by Cramer's own comments and the historical performance of the stock after downgrades.  The overall sentiment is leaning towards a short-term negative impact, but the magnitude is likely to be moderate due to Apple's overall market position and resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is generally seen as a strong vote of confidence from a highly respected investor. This is likely to positively influence investor sentiment, as Buffett's long-term value-oriented approach aligns well with Apple's stable performance and dividend-paying nature. However, the news does not provide any new fundamental data about Apple's current performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some models (like openai/gpt-4o-mini and deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others (like meta-llama/llama-4-scout and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) highlight concerns about slowing iPhone sales and innovation momentum. Given Buffett's reputation and the size of his investment, the positive sentiment is likely to outweigh the negative, but the effect may be moderate. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price.

Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with muted sales and earnings growth expected. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down, and 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days, indicating concerns about Apple's growth trajectory.

However, the mixed signals from other analysts and commentators suggest there could be some volatility.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment.

However, the news does not provide new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit the immediate impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some analysts expressing concerns about Apple's growth trajectory and others highlighting Buffett's influence. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, supported by Buffett's endorsement, but tempered by existing concerns about Apple's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's defense of its DEI policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating due to political pressure. Costco's successful defense is a positive precedent. Apple's upcoming vote on a similar shareholder proposal suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI. However, potential legal challenges from Republican-led states introduce some uncertainty. Considering previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on Warren Buffett's investment (from previous rounds), while others predicted a fall due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. Given the current news context and the previous predictions, I believe the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's commitment to DEI could be seen as a positive signal, but the potential legal challenges and mixed previous predictions temper the optimism. The fact that other companies are retreating from DEI could also put Apple in a more scrutinized position, potentially leading to negative sentiment from some investors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed. Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, sold some Apple stock due to its large weighting in his portfolio and anticipates a disappointing earnings report. This is a negative short-term signal. However, he also notes Apple's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, suggesting a more positive long-term outlook.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance. Some models emphasize the positive influence of Warren Buffett's investment, while others highlight concerns about slowing sales and reduced innovation.  Considering the conflicting signals, the short-term impact is likely to be dominated by Cramer's negative assessment and the anticipated earnings miss.  However, Apple's overall market position and resilience should limit the downside. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall in the short term, but acknowledge the potential for a rebound based on long-term fundamentals and historical patterns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). Warren Buffett's significant investment of $69.9 billion in Apple is a strong positive signal, as his long-term value-oriented approach is highly respected and can boost investor confidence. However, the news lacks new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit its immediate impact. Previous predictions show a divide: some models (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) lean towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others (e.g., meta-llama/llama-4-scout, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) highlight concerns about slowing iPhone sales and innovation momentum. Additionally, Jim Cramer's recent sale of Apple stock and his prediction of a missed quarter introduce short-term negative sentiment. Balancing these factors, the positive influence of Buffett's investment is likely to outweigh the negative signals, but the effect may be moderate. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price.
