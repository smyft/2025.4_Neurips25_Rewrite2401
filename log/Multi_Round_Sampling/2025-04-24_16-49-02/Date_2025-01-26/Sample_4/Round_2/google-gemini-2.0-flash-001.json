(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) often signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the news does not provide any new information about Apple's performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Overall, the association with Buffett, a well-respected investor, tends to create a favorable outlook for the stock, leading to a higher probability of price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader trend of companies reacting to political pressure regarding DEI initiatives. While Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is highlighted, the article directly mentions Apple (AAPL) facing a similar shareholder proposal. The article states that Apple is defending its DEI stance. This suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI, but also a potential risk if the shareholder proposal gains traction. However, given Costco's overwhelming success (98% support), and the fact that Apple has already stated its position, the risk seems relatively low. The broader market trend of companies retreating from DEI could create some uncertainty, but Apple's firm stance might be viewed favorably by a significant portion of investors, especially those focused on ESG factors. The article also mentions potential legal challenges from Republican-led states, which could introduce some volatility, but this is a broader market concern rather than specific to Apple at this moment. Overall, the news is slightly positive for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio.  While he anticipates Apple missing its quarterly earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's historical performance of rising after downgrades. This creates a mixed signal.  The fact that he's selling some stock suggests a negative outlook in the short term, but his long-term view is more positive. The article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks, indirectly suggesting that he sees better opportunities elsewhere.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is a strong endorsement from one of the most respected investors in the world. Buffett's investment style is long-term and value-oriented, which often attracts positive attention from the market. This news could boost investor confidence in AAPL, leading to increased demand for the stock. However, the news does not provide any new fundamental or financial data about Apple, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Given Buffett's reputation and the size of the investment, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but the effect may not be dramatic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with muted sales and earnings growth expected. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down, and 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days, indicating concerns about Apple's growth trajectory. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock has a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share according to Fair Value models on InvestingPro. Despite these concerns, Apple's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several big tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. The article suggests that Meta Platforms is a stock to buy due to its strong revenue and earnings growth, as well as its aggressive push into AI. In contrast, Apple is considered a stock to sell due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article also mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Meta Platforms' stock price rising is high, while the probability of Apple's stock price falling is also high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment. This endorsement may lead to increased demand for the stock, especially among value-oriented investors. However, the news does not provide new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit the immediate impact. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions, where some analysts express concerns about Apple's growth trajectory and others highlight Buffett's influence, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI in light of a broader trend of companies retreating from such policies due to political pressure. Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is presented as a positive example, and Apple is mentioned as also defending its DEI stance against a similar shareholder proposal. This suggests that Apple is likely to maintain its DEI efforts, which could be viewed favorably by investors who value ESG factors. However, the article also mentions potential legal challenges from Republican-led states, which could introduce some volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on Warren Buffett's investment, while others predicted a fall due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. Given the current news context and the previous predictions, I believe the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's commitment to DEI could be seen as a positive signal, but the potential legal challenges and mixed previous predictions temper the optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling some Apple stock due to its oversized portfolio position is the most impactful piece of information. While he expresses some long-term optimism and acknowledges the stock's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, the immediate action of selling suggests a negative short-term outlook.  His prediction of a missed quarter further reinforces this negative sentiment.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models emphasizing the positive influence of Warren Buffett's investment and others highlighting the negative implications of Cramer's actions and anticipated earnings miss. Considering the weight of Cramer's immediate action and the expectation of a disappointing quarter, the probability of a short-term price fall is higher than a rise. However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, as indicated by Cramer's own comments and the historical performance of the stock after downgrades.  The overall sentiment is leaning towards a short-term negative impact, but the magnitude is likely to be moderate due to Apple's overall market position and resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is generally seen as a strong vote of confidence from a highly respected investor. This is likely to positively influence investor sentiment, as Buffett's long-term value-oriented approach aligns well with Apple's stable performance and dividend-paying nature. However, the news does not provide any new fundamental data about Apple's current performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some models (like openai/gpt-4o-mini and deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others (like meta-llama/llama-4-scout and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) highlight concerns about slowing iPhone sales and innovation momentum. Given Buffett's reputation and the size of his investment, the positive sentiment is likely to outweigh the negative, but the effect may be moderate. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price.
