(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) often signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the news does not provide any new information about Apple's performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Overall, the association with Buffett, a well-respected investor, tends to create a favorable outlook for the stock, leading to a higher probability of price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader trend of companies reacting to political pressure regarding DEI initiatives. While Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is highlighted, the article directly mentions Apple (AAPL) facing a similar shareholder proposal. The article states that Apple is defending its DEI stance. This suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI, but also a potential risk if the shareholder proposal gains traction. However, given Costco's overwhelming success (98% support), and the fact that Apple has already stated its position, the risk seems relatively low. The broader market trend of companies retreating from DEI could create some uncertainty, but Apple's firm stance might be viewed favorably by a significant portion of investors, especially those focused on ESG factors. The article also mentions potential legal challenges from Republican-led states, which could introduce some volatility, but this is a broader market concern rather than specific to Apple at this moment. Overall, the news is slightly positive for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio.  While he anticipates Apple missing its quarterly earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's historical performance of rising after downgrades. This creates a mixed signal.  The fact that he's selling some stock suggests a negative outlook in the short term, but his long-term view is more positive. The article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks, indirectly suggesting that he sees better opportunities elsewhere.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is a strong endorsement from one of the most respected investors in the world. Buffett's investment style is long-term and value-oriented, which often attracts positive attention from the market. This news could boost investor confidence in AAPL, leading to increased demand for the stock. However, the news does not provide any new fundamental or financial data about Apple, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Given Buffett's reputation and the size of the investment, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but the effect may not be dramatic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with muted sales and earnings growth expected. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down, and 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days, indicating concerns about Apple's growth trajectory. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock has a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share according to Fair Value models on InvestingPro. Despite these concerns, Apple's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several big tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. The article suggests that Meta Platforms is a stock to buy due to its strong revenue and earnings growth, as well as its aggressive push into AI. In contrast, Apple is considered a stock to sell due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article also mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Meta Platforms' stock price rising is high, while the probability of Apple's stock price falling is also high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment. This endorsement may lead to increased demand for the stock, especially among value-oriented investors. However, the news does not provide new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit the immediate impact. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions, where some analysts express concerns about Apple's growth trajectory and others highlight Buffett's influence, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI in light of a broader trend of companies retreating from such policies due to political pressure. Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is presented as a positive example, and Apple is mentioned as also defending its DEI stance against a similar shareholder proposal. This suggests that Apple is likely to maintain its DEI efforts, which could be viewed favorably by investors who value ESG factors. However, the article also mentions potential legal challenges from Republican-led states, which could introduce some volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on Warren Buffett's investment, while others predicted a fall due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. Given the current news context and the previous predictions, I believe the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's commitment to DEI could be seen as a positive signal, but the potential legal challenges and mixed previous predictions temper the optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling some Apple stock due to its oversized portfolio position is the most impactful piece of information. While he expresses some long-term optimism and acknowledges the stock's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, the immediate action of selling suggests a negative short-term outlook.  His prediction of a missed quarter further reinforces this negative sentiment.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models emphasizing the positive influence of Warren Buffett's investment and others highlighting the negative implications of Cramer's actions and anticipated earnings miss. Considering the weight of Cramer's immediate action and the expectation of a disappointing quarter, the probability of a short-term price fall is higher than a rise. However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, as indicated by Cramer's own comments and the historical performance of the stock after downgrades.  The overall sentiment is leaning towards a short-term negative impact, but the magnitude is likely to be moderate due to Apple's overall market position and resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is generally seen as a strong vote of confidence from a highly respected investor. This is likely to positively influence investor sentiment, as Buffett's long-term value-oriented approach aligns well with Apple's stable performance and dividend-paying nature. However, the news does not provide any new fundamental data about Apple's current performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some models (like openai/gpt-4o-mini and deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others (like meta-llama/llama-4-scout and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) highlight concerns about slowing iPhone sales and innovation momentum. Given Buffett's reputation and the size of his investment, the positive sentiment is likely to outweigh the negative, but the effect may be moderate. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down, and 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days, indicating concerns about Apple's growth trajectory. However, Apple's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price.

Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some analysts expressing concerns about Apple's growth trajectory and others highlighting Buffett's influence. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, supported by Buffett's endorsement, but tempered by existing concerns about Apple's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's defense of its DEI policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating due to political pressure. Costco's successful defense is a positive precedent. Apple's upcoming vote on a similar shareholder proposal suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI. However, potential legal challenges from Republican-led states introduce some uncertainty. Considering previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on Warren Buffett's investment (from previous rounds), while others predicted a fall due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. Given the current news context and the previous predictions, I believe the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's commitment to DEI could be seen as a positive signal, but the potential legal challenges and mixed previous predictions temper the optimism. The fact that other companies are retreating from DEI could also put Apple in a more scrutinized position, potentially leading to negative sentiment from some investors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed. Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, sold some Apple stock due to its large weighting in his portfolio and anticipates a disappointing earnings report. This is a negative short-term signal. However, he also notes Apple's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, suggesting a more positive long-term outlook.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance. Some models emphasize the positive influence of Warren Buffett's investment, while others highlight concerns about slowing sales and reduced innovation.  Considering the conflicting signals, the short-term impact is likely to be dominated by Cramer's negative assessment and the anticipated earnings miss.  However, Apple's overall market position and resilience should limit the downside. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall in the short term, but acknowledge the potential for a rebound based on long-term fundamentals and historical patterns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). Warren Buffett's significant investment of $69.9 billion in Apple is a strong positive signal, as his long-term value-oriented approach is highly respected and can boost investor confidence. However, the news lacks new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit its immediate impact. Previous predictions show a divide: some models (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) lean towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others (e.g., meta-llama/llama-4-scout, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) highlight concerns about slowing iPhone sales and innovation momentum. Additionally, Jim Cramer's recent sale of Apple stock and his prediction of a missed quarter introduce short-term negative sentiment. Balancing these factors, the positive influence of Buffett's investment is likely to outweigh the negative signals, but the effect may be moderate.

Costco's successful defense is a positive precedent. Apple's upcoming vote on a similar shareholder proposal suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI. However, potential legal challenges from Republican-led states introduce some uncertainty. Considering previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment.

The fact that other companies are retreating from DEI could also put Apple in a more scrutinized position, potentially leading to negative sentiment from some investors.

Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, selling some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing and predicting a disappointing earnings report is a significant negative short-term signal. This outweighs the generally positive long-term sentiment associated with Warren Buffett's continued investment. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's historical tendency to rebound after downgrades, the immediate action of selling and the expectation of a poor quarter dominate the short-term outlook.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance.  Considering the weight of Cramer's negative assessment and the anticipated earnings miss, the probability of a short-term price fall is higher. However, Apple's large market capitalization and overall resilience should limit the potential downside. The long-term outlook remains uncertain, but the short-term impact is likely to be negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc.

Previous predictions show a divide: some models lean towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others highlight concerns about slowing iPhone sales and innovation momentum.

Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with muted sales and earnings growth expected. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down, and 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days, indicating concerns about Apple's growth trajectory. However, Apple's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering these factors and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several big tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. Apple is considered a stock to sell due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, with its guidance for the current quarter anticipated to disappoint. However, the company's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current news context, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings. However, the mixed signals from other analysts and commentators suggest there could be some volatility. The overall sentiment from previous predictions indicates a mix of positive influences from Warren Buffett's investment and negative implications from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
