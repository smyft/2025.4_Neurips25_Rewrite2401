(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) often signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the news does not provide any new information about Apple's performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Overall, the association with Buffett, a well-respected investor, tends to create a favorable outlook for the stock, leading to a higher probability of price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader trend of companies reacting to political pressure regarding DEI initiatives. While Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is highlighted, the article directly mentions Apple (AAPL) facing a similar shareholder proposal. The article states that Apple is defending its DEI stance. This suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI, but also a potential risk if the shareholder proposal gains traction. However, given Costco's overwhelming success (98% support), and the fact that Apple has already stated its position, the risk seems relatively low. The broader market trend of companies retreating from DEI could create some uncertainty, but Apple's firm stance might be viewed favorably by a significant portion of investors, especially those focused on ESG factors. The article also mentions potential legal challenges from Republican-led states, which could introduce some volatility, but this is a broader market concern rather than specific to Apple at this moment. Overall, the news is slightly positive for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio.  While he anticipates Apple missing its quarterly earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's historical performance of rising after downgrades. This creates a mixed signal.  The fact that he's selling some stock suggests a negative outlook in the short term, but his long-term view is more positive. The article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks, indirectly suggesting that he sees better opportunities elsewhere.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is a strong endorsement from one of the most respected investors in the world. Buffett's investment style is long-term and value-oriented, which often attracts positive attention from the market. This news could boost investor confidence in AAPL, leading to increased demand for the stock. However, the news does not provide any new fundamental or financial data about Apple, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Given Buffett's reputation and the size of the investment, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but the effect may not be dramatic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with muted sales and earnings growth expected. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down, and 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days, indicating concerns about Apple's growth trajectory. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock has a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share according to Fair Value models on InvestingPro. Despite these concerns, Apple's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several big tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. The article suggests that Meta Platforms is a stock to buy due to its strong revenue and earnings growth, as well as its aggressive push into AI. In contrast, Apple is considered a stock to sell due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article also mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Meta Platforms' stock price rising is high, while the probability of Apple's stock price falling is also high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment. This endorsement may lead to increased demand for the stock, especially among value-oriented investors. However, the news does not provide new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit the immediate impact. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions, where some analysts express concerns about Apple's growth trajectory and others highlight Buffett's influence, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI in light of a broader trend of companies retreating from such policies due to political pressure. Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is presented as a positive example, and Apple is mentioned as also defending its DEI stance against a similar shareholder proposal. This suggests that Apple is likely to maintain its DEI efforts, which could be viewed favorably by investors who value ESG factors. However, the article also mentions potential legal challenges from Republican-led states, which could introduce some volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on Warren Buffett's investment, while others predicted a fall due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. Given the current news context and the previous predictions, I believe the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's commitment to DEI could be seen as a positive signal, but the potential legal challenges and mixed previous predictions temper the optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling some Apple stock due to its oversized portfolio position is the most impactful piece of information. While he expresses some long-term optimism and acknowledges the stock's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, the immediate action of selling suggests a negative short-term outlook.  His prediction of a missed quarter further reinforces this negative sentiment.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models emphasizing the positive influence of Warren Buffett's investment and others highlighting the negative implications of Cramer's actions and anticipated earnings miss. Considering the weight of Cramer's immediate action and the expectation of a disappointing quarter, the probability of a short-term price fall is higher than a rise. However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, as indicated by Cramer's own comments and the historical performance of the stock after downgrades.  The overall sentiment is leaning towards a short-term negative impact, but the magnitude is likely to be moderate due to Apple's overall market position and resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is generally seen as a strong vote of confidence from a highly respected investor. This is likely to positively influence investor sentiment, as Buffett's long-term value-oriented approach aligns well with Apple's stable performance and dividend-paying nature. However, the news does not provide any new fundamental data about Apple's current performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some models (like openai/gpt-4o-mini and deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others (like meta-llama/llama-4-scout and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) highlight concerns about slowing iPhone sales and innovation momentum. Given Buffett's reputation and the size of his investment, the positive sentiment is likely to outweigh the negative, but the effect may be moderate. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could negatively impact its stock price.

However, the news does not provide new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit the immediate impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some analysts expressing concerns about Apple's growth trajectory and others highlighting Buffett's influence. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, supported by Buffett's endorsement, but tempered by existing concerns about Apple's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's defense of its DEI policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating due to political pressure. Costco's successful defense is a positive precedent. Apple's upcoming vote on a similar shareholder proposal suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI. However, potential legal challenges from Republican-led states introduce some uncertainty. Considering previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on Warren Buffett's investment (from previous rounds), while others predicted a fall due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. Given the current news context and the previous predictions, I believe the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's commitment to DEI could be seen as a positive signal, but the potential legal challenges and mixed previous predictions temper the optimism. The fact that other companies are retreating from DEI could also put Apple in a more scrutinized position, potentially leading to negative sentiment from some investors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed. Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, sold some Apple stock due to its large weighting in his portfolio and anticipates a disappointing earnings report. This is a negative short-term signal. However, he also notes Apple's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, suggesting a more positive long-term outlook.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance. Some models emphasize the positive influence of Warren Buffett's investment, while others highlight concerns about slowing sales and reduced innovation.  Considering the conflicting signals, the short-term impact is likely to be dominated by Cramer's negative assessment and the anticipated earnings miss.  However, Apple's overall market position and resilience should limit the downside. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall in the short term, but acknowledge the potential for a rebound based on long-term fundamentals and historical patterns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). Warren Buffett's significant investment of $69.9 billion in Apple is a strong positive signal, as his long-term value-oriented approach is highly respected and can boost investor confidence. However, the news lacks new fundamental data about Apple's performance, which may limit its immediate impact. Previous predictions show a divide: some models (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) lean towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others (e.g., meta-llama/llama-4-scout, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) highlight concerns about slowing iPhone sales and innovation momentum. Additionally, Jim Cramer's recent sale of Apple stock and his prediction of a missed quarter introduce short-term negative sentiment.

Costco's successful defense is a positive precedent. Apple's upcoming vote on a similar shareholder proposal suggests a potential positive signal for investors who value DEI. However, potential legal challenges from Republican-led states introduce some uncertainty. Considering previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment.

However, the potential legal challenges and mixed previous predictions temper the optimism. The fact that other companies are retreating from DEI could also put Apple in a more scrutinized position, potentially leading to negative sentiment from some investors.

Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, selling some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing and predicting a disappointing earnings report is a significant negative short-term signal. This outweighs the generally positive long-term sentiment associated with Warren Buffett's continued investment. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's historical tendency to rebound after downgrades, the immediate action of selling and the expectation of a poor quarter dominate the short-term outlook.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance.  Considering the weight of Cramer's negative assessment and the anticipated earnings miss, the probability of a short-term price fall is higher. However, Apple's large market capitalization and overall resilience should limit the potential downside. The long-term outlook remains uncertain, but the short-term impact is likely to be negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc.

Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with muted sales and earnings growth expected. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down, and 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days, indicating concerns about Apple's growth trajectory. However, Apple's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering these factors and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several big tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. Apple is considered a stock to sell due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, with its guidance for the current quarter anticipated to disappoint. However, the company's large market capitalization and influence may cushion its stock price. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current news context, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings. However, the mixed signals from other analysts and commentators suggest there could be some volatility. The overall sentiment from previous predictions indicates a mix of positive influences from Warren Buffett's investment and negative implications from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
