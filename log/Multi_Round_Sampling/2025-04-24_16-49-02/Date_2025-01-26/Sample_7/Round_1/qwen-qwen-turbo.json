(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) often signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the news does not provide any new information about Apple's performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Overall, the association with Buffett, a well-respected investor, tends to create a favorable outlook for the stock, suggesting a higher probability of price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal for investors. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his confidence in a company often leads to increased investor interest and potentially higher stock prices. However, the headline also poses the question of whether it's a buy *now*, implying that the current price might already reflect Buffett's influence. The dividend aspect is a minor positive, attracting income-seeking investors. Considering these factors, the news is likely to have a slightly positive impact, but the 'is it a buy now?' question introduces some uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jefferies downgraded Apple to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and a missed revenue growth guidance.  The downgrade implies a 13% downside. While the news is overwhelmingly negative, Apple is a large, established company, and a 13% drop is not necessarily catastrophic.  The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh this specific negative outlook against Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects.  Given the significant negative sentiment expressed by Jefferies, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the probability of a price rise is not zero, as the market may not fully agree with Jefferies' assessment or may already have priced in some of the negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some AAPL stock due to its large portfolio weight and predicts a potential earnings miss. Cramer also hints at possible downgrades by analysts ahead of the earnings report. Such negative sentiment from a prominent financial commentator could influence investor perception and lead to short-term selling pressure. However, the article also notes AAPL's long-term growth potential, which may mitigate some downside risk. Given the mixed signals but with a stronger emphasis on near-term concerns, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. The stock has also been underperforming, down 11% to start the new year. However, the article also notes that the expected move in the options market for Apple is about 4.6% up or down, indicating some uncertainty but not a clear direction for a significant rise. Based on these factors, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall due to the mentioned headwinds and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock. The article highlights that Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022, primarily due to the stock's stretched valuation. Apple's recent performance has been modest, with trailing-12-month revenue rising by only 1.3% over the past three years. However, the company's high-margin service sales are growing, and it has a strong ability to generate free cash flow. The article concludes that while Apple is still a good long-term hold, its rich valuation makes it not an ideal time to buy. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the market may react negatively to the valuation mismatch and recent sales slowdown.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is currently trading below recent levels. The implied volatility suggests a significant price movement, but given the negative sentiment and the recent analyst downgrades, the likelihood of a price fall is higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
