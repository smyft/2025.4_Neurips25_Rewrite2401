(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Street Calls of the Week\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) often signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the news does not provide any new information about Apple's performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. Overall, the association with Buffett, a well-respected investor, tends to create a favorable outlook for the stock, suggesting a higher probability of price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal for investors. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his confidence in a company often leads to increased investor interest and potentially higher stock prices. However, the headline also poses the question of whether it's a buy *now*, implying that the current price might already reflect Buffett's influence. The dividend aspect is a minor positive, attracting income-seeking investors. Considering these factors, the news is likely to have a slightly positive impact, but the 'is it a buy now?' question introduces some uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jefferies downgraded Apple to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and a missed revenue growth guidance.  The downgrade implies a 13% downside. While the news is overwhelmingly negative, Apple is a large, established company, and a 13% drop is not necessarily catastrophic.  The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh this specific negative outlook against Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects.  Given the significant negative sentiment expressed by Jefferies, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the probability of a price rise is not zero, as the market may not fully agree with Jefferies' assessment or may already have priced in some of the negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some AAPL stock due to its large portfolio weight and predicts a potential earnings miss. Cramer also hints at possible downgrades by analysts ahead of the earnings report. Such negative sentiment from a prominent financial commentator could influence investor perception and lead to short-term selling pressure. However, the article also notes AAPL's long-term growth potential, which may mitigate some downside risk. Given the mixed signals but with a stronger emphasis on near-term concerns, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's challenges, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. The stock has also been underperforming, down 11% to start the new year. However, the article also notes that the expected move in the options market for Apple is about 4.6% up or down, indicating some uncertainty but not a clear direction for a significant rise. Based on these factors, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall due to the mentioned headwinds and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock. The article highlights that Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022, primarily due to the stock's stretched valuation. Apple's recent performance has been modest, with trailing-12-month revenue rising by only 1.3% over the past three years. However, the company's high-margin service sales are growing, and it has a strong ability to generate free cash flow. The article concludes that while Apple is still a good long-term hold, its rich valuation makes it not an ideal time to buy. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the market may react negatively to the valuation mismatch and recent sales slowdown.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is currently trading below recent levels. The implied volatility suggests a significant price movement, but given the negative sentiment and the recent analyst downgrades, the likelihood of a price fall is higher.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment. However, the news does not provide new information about Apple's performance or market conditions, which may limit the immediate impact. The question posed in the headline about whether it is a good time to buy introduces some uncertainty, suggesting that while Buffett's endorsement is positive, there may be concerns about the stock's current valuation and recent performance. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of falling due to existing headwinds and analyst concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\" suggests the current price might already reflect this influence. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a trend of decreasing probability of price rise, influenced by factors like slowing iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. While Buffett's investment is a positive factor, the existing negative sentiment and the question of current valuation temper the potential for a significant price increase. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than the most recent predictions, but still lower than the initial predictions, acknowledging the mixed signals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jefferies' downgrade of Apple to Underperform, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI adoption, and missed revenue growth guidance, is the dominant factor in this analysis.  The projected 13% downside from their $200.75 price target significantly outweighs any potential positive sentiment. While Apple is a large, established company, the specific concerns raised by Jefferies regarding iPhone sales and AI development are substantial.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, aligning with the negative news.  The consensus from previous models, coupled with the weight of the Jefferies downgrade, suggests a higher likelihood of a price decrease in the short term.  However, the probability of a rise isn't zero; Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects could mitigate some of the negative impact, but the immediate outlook is bearish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

Based on these factors, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall due to the mentioned headwinds and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock.

The downgrade by Jefferies, combined with analyst downgrades and mixed signals from other sources, indicate a bearish sentiment. The implied volatility suggests a significant price movement, but the predominance of negative factors leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
