(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X @alexiskweed.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for the S&P 500, with significant focus on major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and a favorable economic environment with expectations of steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the anticipated earnings growth for Apple aligns with the broader positive outlook for the tech sector. However, potential volatility from the Fed's press conference and economic data releases could introduce uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his large stake suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. This could attract other investors, potentially driving up the stock price. However, the article also poses the question 'Is It a Buy Now?', which implies that the current valuation might already reflect this positive sentiment. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a potential shift in the political climate.  While some companies are retreating from DEI programs, Apple's steadfast stance, as evidenced by its urging investors to reject a shareholder proposal against its DEI programs, suggests a strong internal belief in the importance of these initiatives. This could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and inclusive corporate cultures. However, the ongoing legal and political challenges surrounding DEI could create uncertainty and potentially impact investor sentiment negatively.  The article also mentions that Apple's vote on the shareholder proposal will take place next month, meaning the market may not react significantly until after the vote.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderate, while the probability of a price decrease is relatively low, with a significant portion of the probability assigned to no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Jefferies for Apple Inc. due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and concerns over Apple's ability to meet revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment and can lead to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, highlighting that despite being the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, Buffett has been reducing his stake in Apple. The article suggests that the reduction is due to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business itself. Apple's current valuation is about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is considered high given the company's recent performance, with revenue and free cash flow growth being relatively stagnant. However, the article also notes that Apple has a growing services segment and a steadily growing dividend, which could support long-term earnings growth. Despite these factors, the article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reasoning behind the sale is attributed to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business. The article highlights Apple's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which can be used for dividend payments, reinvestment, or debt reduction. However, the article concludes that buying Apple stock now may not be a good idea due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock's market response after previous earnings reports suggests a sensitive reaction to earnings misses. Moreover, Apple's current valuation metrics indicate potential overvaluation, increasing the likelihood of a price correction.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
