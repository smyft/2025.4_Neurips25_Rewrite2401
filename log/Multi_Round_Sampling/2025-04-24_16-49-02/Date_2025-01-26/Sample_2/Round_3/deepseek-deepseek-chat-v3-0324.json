(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Street Calls of the Week\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for the S&P 500, with significant focus on major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and a favorable economic environment with expectations of steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the anticipated earnings growth for Apple aligns with the broader positive outlook for the tech sector. However, potential volatility from the Fed's press conference and economic data releases could introduce uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his large stake suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. This could attract other investors, potentially driving up the stock price. However, the article also poses the question 'Is It a Buy Now?', which implies that the current valuation might already reflect this positive sentiment. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a potential shift in the political climate.  While some companies are retreating from DEI programs, Apple's steadfast stance, as evidenced by its urging investors to reject a shareholder proposal against its DEI programs, suggests a strong internal belief in the importance of these initiatives. This could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and inclusive corporate cultures. However, the ongoing legal and political challenges surrounding DEI could create uncertainty and potentially impact investor sentiment negatively.  The article also mentions that Apple's vote on the shareholder proposal will take place next month, meaning the market may not react significantly until after the vote.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderate, while the probability of a price decrease is relatively low, with a significant portion of the probability assigned to no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Jefferies for Apple Inc. due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and concerns over Apple's ability to meet revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment and can lead to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, highlighting that despite being the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, Buffett has been reducing his stake in Apple. The article suggests that the reduction is due to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business itself. Apple's current valuation is about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is considered high given the company's recent performance, with revenue and free cash flow growth being relatively stagnant. However, the article also notes that Apple has a growing services segment and a steadily growing dividend, which could support long-term earnings growth. Despite these factors, the article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reasoning behind the sale is attributed to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business. The article highlights Apple's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which can be used for dividend payments, reinvestment, or debt reduction. However, the article concludes that buying Apple stock now may not be a good idea due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock's market response after previous earnings reports suggests a sensitive reaction to earnings misses. Moreover, Apple's current valuation metrics indicate potential overvaluation, increasing the likelihood of a price correction.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for major tech companies, including Apple, with expectations of steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and favorable economic conditions. However, there are concerns regarding Apple's valuation and potential headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The mixed signals from previous predictions, with some indicating a strong positive outlook and others highlighting significant risks, suggest a cautious approach. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a notable probability of it falling due to existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\" suggests the valuation might already reflect this. Previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models highlighting positive aspects like Buffett's confidence and others pointing to stretched valuation and potential headwinds. The trend seems to be leaning towards a more negative outlook in later rounds. Considering this, the positive impact of Buffett's investment is likely already priced in, and the question of whether it's a buy now introduces some uncertainty. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not drastically so, as Buffett's position still provides some support.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI initiatives, contrasting it with other companies retreating from such programs.  Apple's decision to defend its DEI policies against shareholder pressure could be viewed positively by some investors who value social responsibility. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news doesn't provide any information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, which are the primary drivers of stock price movements.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price.  Given the lack of direct impact on Apple's financials and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both price increase and decrease, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the limited relevance of the news to Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and concerns over Apple's ability to meet revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment and can lead to a decrease in stock price. Previous predictions also largely favor a probability of the stock price falling, aligning with the negative sentiment from the downgrade.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reduction is attributed to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business. Apple's current valuation is about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is considered high given the company's recent performance, with revenue and free cash flow growth being relatively stagnant. However, Apple has a growing services segment and a steadily growing dividend, which could support long-term earnings growth. Despite these factors, the article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Considering the mixed signals and overall market sentiment, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

However, the article concludes that buying Apple stock now may not be a good idea due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of decreasing confidence in the stock's potential for growth, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. Given this information, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have consistently lowered their revenue forecasts, and the company faces significant headwinds as indicated by market responses to previous earnings reports. Additionally, the valuation metrics suggest potential overvaluation, further increasing the likelihood of a price correction. The overall market sentiment seems less optimistic compared to the initial predictions, with several models suggesting a higher probability of a price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a positive sentiment surrounding the overall tech sector and a strong start to the earnings season, concerns about Apple's valuation, slowing iPhone sales, and potential headwinds from reduced innovation are significant. Previous predictions show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts highlighting the risks associated with Apple's current market position. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but a higher probability of it falling due to the prevailing concerns and mixed signals from the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple and questions whether it's a good time to buy. While Buffett's investment is generally seen as positive, the headline itself introduces doubt. Previous rounds show a trend towards a more negative outlook, with concerns about valuation and slowing growth. The question 'Is It a Buy Now?' suggests the positive impact of Buffett's investment might already be priced in. Considering the mixed signals and the trend in previous predictions, I lean towards a slightly negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI initiatives, contrasting it with other companies' retreats.  While Apple's firm commitment to DEI might be viewed positively by some socially conscious investors, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news lacks information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, the primary drivers of stock price movements.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty.  The prevailing sentiment, however, leans towards a negative outlook due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and overvaluation.  The DEI news is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business and financial performance. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is low, while the probability of a price decrease is higher, reflecting the weight of negative sentiment from other factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside.
