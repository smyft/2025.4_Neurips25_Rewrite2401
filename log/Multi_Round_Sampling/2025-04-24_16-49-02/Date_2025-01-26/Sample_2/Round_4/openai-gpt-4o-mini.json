      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for the S&P 500, with significant focus on major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and a favorable economic environment with expectations of steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the anticipated earnings growth for Apple aligns with the broader positive outlook for the tech sector. However, potential volatility from the Fed's press conference and economic data releases could introduce uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his large stake suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. This could attract other investors, potentially driving up the stock price. However, the article also poses the question 'Is It a Buy Now?', which implies that the current valuation might already reflect this positive sentiment. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a potential shift in the political climate.  While some companies are retreating from DEI programs, Apple's steadfast stance, as evidenced by its urging investors to reject a shareholder proposal against its DEI programs, suggests a strong internal belief in the importance of these initiatives. This could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and inclusive corporate cultures. However, the ongoing legal and political challenges surrounding DEI could create uncertainty and potentially impact investor sentiment negatively.  The article also mentions that Apple's vote on the shareholder proposal will take place next month, meaning the market may not react significantly until after the vote.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderate, while the probability of a price decrease is relatively low, with a significant portion of the probability assigned to no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Jefferies for Apple Inc. due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and concerns over Apple's ability to meet revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment and can lead to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, highlighting that despite being the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, Buffett has been reducing his stake in Apple. The article suggests that the reduction is due to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business itself. Apple's current valuation is about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is considered high given the company's recent performance, with revenue and free cash flow growth being relatively stagnant. However, the article also notes that Apple has a growing services segment and a steadily growing dividend, which could support long-term earnings growth. Despite these factors, the article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reasoning behind the sale is attributed to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business. The article highlights Apple's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which can be used for dividend payments, reinvestment, or debt reduction. However, the article concludes that buying Apple stock now may not be a good idea due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock's market response after previous earnings reports suggests a sensitive reaction to earnings misses. Moreover, Apple's current valuation metrics indicate potential overvaluation, increasing the likelihood of a price correction.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for major tech companies, including Apple, with expectations of steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and favorable economic conditions. However, there are concerns regarding Apple's valuation and potential headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The mixed signals from previous predictions, with some indicating a strong positive outlook and others highlighting significant risks, suggest a cautious approach. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a notable probability of it falling due to existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\" suggests the valuation might already reflect this. Previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models highlighting positive aspects like Buffett's confidence and others pointing to stretched valuation and potential headwinds. The trend seems to be leaning towards a more negative outlook in later rounds. Considering this, the positive impact of Buffett's investment is likely already priced in, and the question of whether it's a buy now introduces some uncertainty. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not drastically so, as Buffett's position still provides some support.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI initiatives, contrasting it with other companies retreating from such programs.  Apple's decision to defend its DEI policies against shareholder pressure could be viewed positively by some investors who value social responsibility. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news doesn't provide any information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, which are the primary drivers of stock price movements.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price.  Given the lack of direct impact on Apple's financials and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both price increase and decrease, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the limited relevance of the news to Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and concerns over Apple's ability to meet revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment and can lead to a decrease in stock price. Previous predictions also largely favor a probability of the stock price falling, aligning with the negative sentiment from the downgrade.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reduction is attributed to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business. Apple's current valuation is about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is considered high given the company's recent performance, with revenue and free cash flow growth being relatively stagnant. However, Apple has a growing services segment and a steadily growing dividend, which could support long-term earnings growth.

However, the article concludes that buying Apple stock now may not be a good idea due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of decreasing confidence in the stock's potential for growth, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. Given this information, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have consistently lowered their revenue forecasts, and the company faces significant headwinds as indicated by market responses to previous earnings reports. Additionally, the valuation metrics suggest potential overvaluation, further increasing the likelihood of a price correction. The overall market sentiment seems less optimistic compared to the initial predictions, with several models suggesting a higher probability of a price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a positive sentiment surrounding the overall tech sector and a strong start to the earnings season, concerns about Apple's valuation, slowing iPhone sales, and potential headwinds from reduced innovation are significant. Previous predictions show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts highlighting the risks associated with Apple's current market position. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but a higher probability of it falling due to the prevailing concerns and mixed signals from the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple and questions whether it's a good time to buy. While Buffett's investment is generally seen as positive, the headline itself introduces doubt. Previous rounds show a trend towards a more negative outlook, with concerns about valuation and slowing growth. The question 'Is It a Buy Now?' suggests the positive impact of Buffett's investment might already be priced in. Considering the mixed signals and the trend in previous predictions, I lean towards a slightly negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI initiatives, contrasting it with other companies' retreats.  While Apple's firm commitment to DEI might be viewed positively by some socially conscious investors, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news lacks information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, the primary drivers of stock price movements.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty.  The prevailing sentiment, however, leans towards a negative outlook due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and overvaluation.  The DEI news is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business and financial performance. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is low, while the probability of a price decrease is higher, reflecting the weight of negative sentiment from other factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside.

Such analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment and can lead to a decrease in stock price. Previous predictions also largely favor a probability of the stock price falling, aligning with the negative sentiment from the downgrade. Despite some positive aspects like Apple's services segment and dividend growth, the overall sentiment and recent analyst actions suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

This suggests uncertainty about the current valuation. Previous predictions show a clear trend towards a more negative outlook, with concerns about stretched valuation, slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and analyst downgrades. While Buffett's investment is a positive signal, the headline's framing and the prevailing negative sentiment outweigh this. The trend in previous predictions is a significant factor, indicating a growing consensus that the stock is more likely to fall than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's steadfast commitment to DEI initiatives despite growing political pressure against such programs.

The previous predictions show a strong trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily driven by concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and overvaluation.  These concerns, highlighted by analyst downgrades and Warren Buffett's reduction of his Apple stake, significantly outweigh the potential positive impact of Apple's DEI position.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considerably higher than the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside.

Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but a higher probability of it falling due to the prevailing concerns and mixed signals from the market.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
