(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for the S&P 500, with significant focus on major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and a favorable economic environment with expectations of steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the anticipated earnings growth for Apple aligns with the broader positive outlook for the tech sector. However, potential volatility from the Fed's press conference and economic data releases could introduce uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his large stake suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. This could attract other investors, potentially driving up the stock price. However, the article also poses the question 'Is It a Buy Now?', which implies that the current valuation might already reflect this positive sentiment. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a potential shift in the political climate.  While some companies are retreating from DEI programs, Apple's steadfast stance, as evidenced by its urging investors to reject a shareholder proposal against its DEI programs, suggests a strong internal belief in the importance of these initiatives. This could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and inclusive corporate cultures. However, the ongoing legal and political challenges surrounding DEI could create uncertainty and potentially impact investor sentiment negatively.  The article also mentions that Apple's vote on the shareholder proposal will take place next month, meaning the market may not react significantly until after the vote.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderate, while the probability of a price decrease is relatively low, with a significant portion of the probability assigned to no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Jefferies for Apple Inc. due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and concerns over Apple's ability to meet revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment and can lead to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, highlighting that despite being the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, Buffett has been reducing his stake in Apple. The article suggests that the reduction is due to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business itself. Apple's current valuation is about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is considered high given the company's recent performance, with revenue and free cash flow growth being relatively stagnant. However, the article also notes that Apple has a growing services segment and a steadily growing dividend, which could support long-term earnings growth. Despite these factors, the article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reasoning behind the sale is attributed to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business. The article highlights Apple's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which can be used for dividend payments, reinvestment, or debt reduction. However, the article concludes that buying Apple stock now may not be a good idea due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock's market response after previous earnings reports suggests a sensitive reaction to earnings misses. Moreover, Apple's current valuation metrics indicate potential overvaluation, increasing the likelihood of a price correction.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for major tech companies, including Apple, with expectations of steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and favorable economic conditions. However, there are concerns regarding Apple's valuation and potential headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The mixed signals from previous predictions, with some indicating a strong positive outlook and others highlighting significant risks, suggest a cautious approach. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a notable probability of it falling due to existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\" suggests the valuation might already reflect this. Previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models highlighting positive aspects like Buffett's confidence and others pointing to stretched valuation and potential headwinds. The trend seems to be leaning towards a more negative outlook in later rounds. Considering this, the positive impact of Buffett's investment is likely already priced in, and the question of whether it's a buy now introduces some uncertainty. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not drastically so, as Buffett's position still provides some support.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI initiatives, contrasting it with other companies retreating from such programs.  Apple's decision to defend its DEI policies against shareholder pressure could be viewed positively by some investors who value social responsibility. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news doesn't provide any information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, which are the primary drivers of stock price movements.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price.  Given the lack of direct impact on Apple's financials and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both price increase and decrease, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the limited relevance of the news to Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and concerns over Apple's ability to meet revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment and can lead to a decrease in stock price. Previous predictions also largely favor a probability of the stock price falling, aligning with the negative sentiment from the downgrade.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reduction is attributed to Apple's stretched valuation rather than concerns about the business. Apple's current valuation is about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is considered high given the company's recent performance, with revenue and free cash flow growth being relatively stagnant. However, Apple has a growing services segment and a steadily growing dividend, which could support long-term earnings growth.

However, the article concludes that buying Apple stock now may not be a good idea due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of decreasing confidence in the stock's potential for growth, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. Given this information, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have consistently lowered their revenue forecasts, and the company faces significant headwinds as indicated by market responses to previous earnings reports. Additionally, the valuation metrics suggest potential overvaluation, further increasing the likelihood of a price correction. The overall market sentiment seems less optimistic compared to the initial predictions, with several models suggesting a higher probability of a price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a positive sentiment surrounding the overall tech sector and a strong start to the earnings season, concerns about Apple's valuation, slowing iPhone sales, and potential headwinds from reduced innovation are significant. Previous predictions show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts highlighting the risks associated with Apple's current market position. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but a higher probability of it falling due to the prevailing concerns and mixed signals from the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple and questions whether it's a good time to buy. While Buffett's investment is generally seen as positive, the headline itself introduces doubt. Previous rounds show a trend towards a more negative outlook, with concerns about valuation and slowing growth. The question 'Is It a Buy Now?' suggests the positive impact of Buffett's investment might already be priced in. Considering the mixed signals and the trend in previous predictions, I lean towards a slightly negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's stance on DEI initiatives, contrasting it with other companies' retreats.  While Apple's firm commitment to DEI might be viewed positively by some socially conscious investors, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news lacks information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, the primary drivers of stock price movements.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty.  The prevailing sentiment, however, leans towards a negative outlook due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and overvaluation.  The DEI news is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business and financial performance. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is low, while the probability of a price decrease is higher, reflecting the weight of negative sentiment from other factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook, with a price target implying a 13% downside.

This suggests uncertainty about the current valuation. Previous predictions show a clear trend towards a more negative outlook, with concerns about stretched valuation, slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and analyst downgrades. While Buffett's investment is a positive signal, the headline's framing and the prevailing negative sentiment outweigh this. The trend in previous predictions is a significant factor, indicating a growing consensus that the stock is more likely to fall than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's steadfast commitment to DEI initiatives despite growing political pressure against such programs.

The previous predictions show a strong trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily driven by concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and overvaluation.  These concerns, highlighted by analyst downgrades and Warren Buffett's reduction of his Apple stake, significantly outweigh the potential positive impact of Apple's DEI position.
