(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

Follow him on X @_joshschafer.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing significant headwinds, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has already seen a decline of 11% at the start of the year. The upcoming earnings report is expected to show muted sales and earnings growth, further contributing to a bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it highlights Jim Cramer's past positive views and the company's strong hedge fund ownership, it also emphasizes his recent decision to sell some AAPL stock due to portfolio size concerns and his expectation of a disappointing quarter. Cramer's anticipation of analyst downgrades further contributes to a potentially negative short-term sentiment. The article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns in the short term. Overall, the negative signals outweigh the positives, suggesting a higher likelihood of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jefferies downgraded Apple to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and a missed revenue growth guidance.  The downgrade implies a 13% downside. While the news is overwhelmingly negative, Apple is a large, established company, and a 13% drop is not necessarily catastrophic.  The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh this specific negative outlook against Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects.  Given the significant negative sentiment expressed by Jefferies, the probability of a price fall is higher, but the possibility of a rise (perhaps due to market resilience or other unrelated positive factors) cannot be entirely discounted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market sentiment due to the S&P 500's strong start under the new Trump administration, 2) Anticipation of Apple's earnings report, which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks expected to show strong earnings growth, 3) A rally in tech stocks fueled by Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement, and 4) A generally stable macroeconomic environment with the Fed expected to hold rates steady. However, there is some uncertainty around the Fed's commentary and potential policy clashes with Trump. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the overall positive market trends, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service sales are growing, the stock's valuation is stretched at 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, and the company's recent performance has been less impressive with only 1.3% revenue growth over the past three years. The analyst concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower, while the probability of it falling is higher, especially if the market becomes nervous about Apple's earnings deceleration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news that Warren Buffett has a significant investment in Apple Inc. ($69.9 billion) could be seen as a positive endorsement of the company, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock. As a dividend-paying stock, it may also attract income-seeking investors. However, it's essential to consider that Buffett's investment is already public knowledge and may have been factored into the current stock price. Additionally, the article's title might be perceived as somewhat sensational, which could lead to a short-term price increase but may not necessarily reflect a long-term value increase.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally in the S&P 500 suggest bullish momentum. However, any negative news from the Fed meeting or Apple's earnings could cause a shift. Given the strong market performance, the focus on AI investments, and the generally positive economic indicators, there is a higher likelihood of a stock price rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
