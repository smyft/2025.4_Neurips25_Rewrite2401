(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Warren Buffett Has $69.9 Billion Invested in This Dividend-Paying Stock. Is It a Buy Now?\nNews Content: There are many ways to get rich on Wall Street, but none seem as reliable as the strategies employed by Warren Buffett. The legendary investor took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965. Over the past six decades, the stock has delivered a 19.6% average annual gain.\n\nThere aren't any secrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.\n\nWe can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 million Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.\n\nApple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.\n\nWhy Buffett sold heaps of Apple shares\n\nBuffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top of Berkshire's portfolio if he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.\n\nBerkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.AAPL Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.\n\nTrailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.\n\nA mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.\n\nWhy holding some Apple shares is still a good idea\n\nInvestors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue.\u00a0While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.\n\nThe bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.\n\nNot time to buy\n\nApple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It a Buy Now? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing significant headwinds, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has already seen a decline of 11% at the start of the year. The upcoming earnings report is expected to show muted sales and earnings growth, further contributing to a bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it highlights Jim Cramer's past positive views and the company's strong hedge fund ownership, it also emphasizes his recent decision to sell some AAPL stock due to portfolio size concerns and his expectation of a disappointing quarter. Cramer's anticipation of analyst downgrades further contributes to a potentially negative short-term sentiment. The article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns in the short term. Overall, the negative signals outweigh the positives, suggesting a higher likelihood of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jefferies downgraded Apple to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and a missed revenue growth guidance.  The downgrade implies a 13% downside. While the news is overwhelmingly negative, Apple is a large, established company, and a 13% drop is not necessarily catastrophic.  The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh this specific negative outlook against Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects.  Given the significant negative sentiment expressed by Jefferies, the probability of a price fall is higher, but the possibility of a rise (perhaps due to market resilience or other unrelated positive factors) cannot be entirely discounted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market sentiment due to the S&P 500's strong start under the new Trump administration, 2) Anticipation of Apple's earnings report, which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks expected to show strong earnings growth, 3) A rally in tech stocks fueled by Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement, and 4) A generally stable macroeconomic environment with the Fed expected to hold rates steady. However, there is some uncertainty around the Fed's commentary and potential policy clashes with Trump. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the overall positive market trends, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service sales are growing, the stock's valuation is stretched at 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, and the company's recent performance has been less impressive with only 1.3% revenue growth over the past three years. The analyst concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower, while the probability of it falling is higher, especially if the market becomes nervous about Apple's earnings deceleration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news that Warren Buffett has a significant investment in Apple Inc. ($69.9 billion) could be seen as a positive endorsement of the company, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock. As a dividend-paying stock, it may also attract income-seeking investors. However, it's essential to consider that Buffett's investment is already public knowledge and may have been factored into the current stock price. Additionally, the article's title might be perceived as somewhat sensational, which could lead to a short-term price increase but may not necessarily reflect a long-term value increase.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally in the S&P 500 suggest bullish momentum. However, any negative news from the Fed meeting or Apple's earnings could cause a shift. Given the strong market performance, the focus on AI investments, and the generally positive economic indicators, there is a higher likelihood of a stock price rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
