(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing significant headwinds, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has already seen a decline of 11% at the start of the year. The upcoming earnings report is expected to show muted sales and earnings growth, further contributing to a bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it highlights Jim Cramer's past positive views and the company's strong hedge fund ownership, it also emphasizes his recent decision to sell some AAPL stock due to portfolio size concerns and his expectation of a disappointing quarter. Cramer's anticipation of analyst downgrades further contributes to a potentially negative short-term sentiment. The article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns in the short term. Overall, the negative signals outweigh the positives, suggesting a higher likelihood of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jefferies downgraded Apple to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and a missed revenue growth guidance.  The downgrade implies a 13% downside. While the news is overwhelmingly negative, Apple is a large, established company, and a 13% drop is not necessarily catastrophic.  The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh this specific negative outlook against Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects.  Given the significant negative sentiment expressed by Jefferies, the probability of a price fall is higher, but the possibility of a rise (perhaps due to market resilience or other unrelated positive factors) cannot be entirely discounted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market sentiment due to the S&P 500's strong start under the new Trump administration, 2) Anticipation of Apple's earnings report, which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks expected to show strong earnings growth, 3) A rally in tech stocks fueled by Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement, and 4) A generally stable macroeconomic environment with the Fed expected to hold rates steady. However, there is some uncertainty around the Fed's commentary and potential policy clashes with Trump. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the overall positive market trends, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service sales are growing, the stock's valuation is stretched at 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, and the company's recent performance has been less impressive with only 1.3% revenue growth over the past three years. The analyst concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower, while the probability of it falling is higher, especially if the market becomes nervous about Apple's earnings deceleration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news that Warren Buffett has a significant investment in Apple Inc. ($69.9 billion) could be seen as a positive endorsement of the company, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock. As a dividend-paying stock, it may also attract income-seeking investors. However, it's essential to consider that Buffett's investment is already public knowledge and may have been factored into the current stock price. Additionally, the article's title might be perceived as somewhat sensational, which could lead to a short-term price increase but may not necessarily reflect a long-term value increase.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally in the S&P 500 suggest bullish momentum. However, any negative news from the Fed meeting or Apple's earnings could cause a shift. Given the strong market performance, the focus on AI investments, and the generally positive economic indicators, there is a higher likelihood of a stock price rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges facing Apple, including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to show muted sales and earnings growth. Additionally, the stock has already seen a decline of 11% at the start of the year. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The current news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to reduce Apple's weight in his portfolio due to its size and his expectation of a disappointing quarter. He also anticipates analyst downgrades. This is a significantly negative signal. While the article mentions Cramer's past positive views and Apple's strong hedge fund ownership, the immediate impact of Cramer's recent actions and statements is likely to be negative. Considering the previous rounds, there's a wide range of predictions, but the more recent ones lean towards a negative outlook. Given Cramer's influence and the specific reasons he provides, a price decrease is more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on a Jefferies downgrade of Apple to Underperform, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI adoption, and missed revenue growth guidance.  This is a significant negative factor. The projected 13% downside from the new price target is a strong bearish signal. While previous predictions varied widely, the consistent theme of negative sentiment towards Apple's near-term prospects, coupled with the concrete downgrade and price target, outweighs any potential positive factors.  The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, and this news reinforces that sentiment.  While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the short-term outlook is clouded by these concerns. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the S&P 500 has had a strong start under the new Trump administration, and tech stocks, including Apple, have rallied due to a $500 billion AI investment announcement. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks expected to show strong earnings growth, and the Fed is expected to hold rates steady, which generally supports market stability. However, there are potential headwinds, such as the Fed's commentary on future policy, potential policy clashes with Trump, and the upcoming earnings report, which could reveal muted sales and earnings growth. Given the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's strong position in the tech sector, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but uncertainties remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service sales are growing, the stock's valuation is stretched at 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, and the company's recent performance has been less impressive with only 1.3% revenue growth over the past three years. The analyst concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and stagnant sales and profits. However, Apple's steadily growing dividend payments and its strong position in the tech sector could contribute to a stable or rising stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than that of it falling, but still possible due to the company's strong fundamentals and growing service sales.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Warren Buffett has a significant investment in Apple Inc., which could be seen as a positive endorsement of the company. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to factors such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and rich valuation. On the other hand, some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive market sentiment, anticipation of strong earnings growth, and the company's strong position in the tech sector. Given the mixed outlook and the fact that Buffett's investment is already public knowledge, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally in the S&P 500 suggest bullish momentum. However, any negative news from the Fed meeting or Apple's earnings could cause a shift. Given the strong market performance, the focus on AI investments, and the generally positive economic indicators, there is a higher likelihood of a stock price rise. However, the mixed signals and recent analyst downgrades suggest caution.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
