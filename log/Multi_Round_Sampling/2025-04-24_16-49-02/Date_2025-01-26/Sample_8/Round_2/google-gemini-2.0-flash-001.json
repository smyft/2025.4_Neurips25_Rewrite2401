(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Warren Buffett Has $69.9 Billion Invested in This Dividend-Paying Stock. Is It a Buy Now?\nNews Content: There are many ways to get rich on Wall Street, but none seem as reliable as the strategies employed by Warren Buffett. The legendary investor took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965. Over the past six decades, the stock has delivered a 19.6% average annual gain.\n\nThere aren't any secrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.\n\nWe can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 million Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.\n\nApple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.\n\nWhy Buffett sold heaps of Apple shares\n\nBuffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top of Berkshire's portfolio if he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.\n\nBerkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.AAPL Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.\n\nTrailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.\n\nA mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.\n\nWhy holding some Apple shares is still a good idea\n\nInvestors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue.\u00a0While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.\n\nThe bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.\n\nNot time to buy\n\nApple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It a Buy Now? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in a company often signals confidence in its long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the headline does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or market conditions, which could also impact stock price movement. Given Buffett's reputation and the general positive perception of dividend-paying stocks, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth, as well as the safety of its dividend. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is irrelevant to the analysis of this specific news piece.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jefferies downgraded Apple to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and a missed revenue growth guidance.  The downgrade implies a 13% downside. While the news is overwhelmingly negative, Apple is a large, established company, and a 13% drop is not necessarily catastrophic.  The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh this specific negative outlook against Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects.  Given the significant negative sentiment expressed by Jefferies, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the probability of a price rise is not zero, as the market may not fully agree with Jefferies' assessment or may already have priced in some of the negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several headwinds for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about its slower adoption of AI. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has underperformed recently, trading at high valuation multiples. The InvestingPro Fair Value models suggest a potential downside of -15.5%. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, has expressed concerns about Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) future performance, stating that he believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. He mentioned that he sold some of his Apple stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expects the stock to go lower. Cramer also noted that there may be downgrades ahead of the quarter report, which could further impact the stock price negatively. Given Cramer's influence and the specific nature of his comments, there is a higher likelihood of a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock. The article highlights that Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has reduced its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022, primarily due to the stock's stretched valuation. Apple's recent performance has been modest, with trailing-12-month revenue rising by only 1.3% over the past three years. However, the company's high-margin service sales are growing, and it has a strong ability to generate free cash flow. The article concludes that while holding some Apple shares is still a good idea, buying the richly valued stock now may not be the best decision. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the article presents more cautionary arguments against buying the stock at its current valuation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio. He expressed concern that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. Given these negative sentiments, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the context of Buffett reducing his stake raises concerns about valuation and future growth. Previous analyses indicate a mix of negative sentiment due to slowing revenue growth, high valuation multiples, and potential downgrades from analysts. While Buffett's involvement may provide some support, the overall tone of the news and previous predictions leans towards caution. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term, but not without some chance of a rise due to Buffett's endorsement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. While Buffett holds a large stake, Berkshire has significantly reduced its position due to valuation concerns. Revenue growth is slow, but the services sector is growing. The article concludes it's not a buy now. Previous predictions lean towards a price fall, citing valuation and potential downgrades. Considering the article's cautious tone and the trend of negative predictions, a price fall is more likely, but the strong services sector and Buffett's continued holding provide some support.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on a Jefferies downgrade of Apple to Underperform, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI adoption, and missed revenue growth guidance.  This is a significant negative factor.  The projected 13% downside from the new price target is a strong indicator of potential price decline. While Apple is a large, established company, the specific concerns raised by Jefferies are substantial.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a clear majority leaning towards a price fall.  Considering the weight of the negative news and the consensus of previous predictions, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the possibility of a price rise is not entirely ruled out, as the market's reaction might be less severe than the analyst's prediction, or the negative news might already be partially priced in.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about slower adoption of AI. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has underperformed recently, trading at high valuation multiples. The InvestingPro Fair Value models suggest a potential downside of -15.5%. Additionally, previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Jim Cramer sold some of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio. He also expressed concerns that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. These negative sentiments suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term decrease in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that Apple's strong brand and overall market position could mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on the information provided and the previous predictions from various models, there seems to be a consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding a significant stake but reducing its position due to valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth, as well as the safety of its dividend. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the mixed tone of the article, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio, concerns about missing the next quarter's results, and potential downgrades before the earnings report. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from various models also predominantly indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, considering the negative outlook and historical predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is relatively low.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
