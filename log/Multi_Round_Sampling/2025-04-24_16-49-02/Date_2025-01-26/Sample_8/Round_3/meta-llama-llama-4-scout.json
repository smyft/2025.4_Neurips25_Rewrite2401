(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in a company often signals confidence in its long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the headline does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or market conditions, which could also impact stock price movement. Given Buffett's reputation and the general positive perception of dividend-paying stocks, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth, as well as the safety of its dividend. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is irrelevant to the analysis of this specific news piece.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jefferies downgraded Apple to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and a missed revenue growth guidance.  The downgrade implies a 13% downside. While the news is overwhelmingly negative, Apple is a large, established company, and a 13% drop is not necessarily catastrophic.  The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh this specific negative outlook against Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects.  Given the significant negative sentiment expressed by Jefferies, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the probability of a price rise is not zero, as the market may not fully agree with Jefferies' assessment or may already have priced in some of the negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several headwinds for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about its slower adoption of AI. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has underperformed recently, trading at high valuation multiples. The InvestingPro Fair Value models suggest a potential downside of -15.5%. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, has expressed concerns about Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) future performance, stating that he believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. He mentioned that he sold some of his Apple stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expects the stock to go lower. Cramer also noted that there may be downgrades ahead of the quarter report, which could further impact the stock price negatively. Given Cramer's influence and the specific nature of his comments, there is a higher likelihood of a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock. The article highlights that Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has reduced its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022, primarily due to the stock's stretched valuation. Apple's recent performance has been modest, with trailing-12-month revenue rising by only 1.3% over the past three years. However, the company's high-margin service sales are growing, and it has a strong ability to generate free cash flow. The article concludes that while holding some Apple shares is still a good idea, buying the richly valued stock now may not be the best decision. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the article presents more cautionary arguments against buying the stock at its current valuation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio. He expressed concern that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. Given these negative sentiments, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the context of Buffett reducing his stake raises concerns about valuation and future growth. Previous analyses indicate a mix of negative sentiment due to slowing revenue growth, high valuation multiples, and potential downgrades from analysts. While Buffett's involvement may provide some support, the overall tone of the news and previous predictions leans towards caution. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term, but not without some chance of a rise due to Buffett's endorsement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. While Buffett holds a large stake, Berkshire has significantly reduced its position due to valuation concerns. Revenue growth is slow, but the services sector is growing. The article concludes it's not a buy now. Previous predictions lean towards a price fall, citing valuation and potential downgrades. Considering the article's cautious tone and the trend of negative predictions, a price fall is more likely, but the strong services sector and Buffett's continued holding provide some support.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on a Jefferies downgrade of Apple to Underperform, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI adoption, and missed revenue growth guidance.  This is a significant negative factor.  The projected 13% downside from the new price target is a strong indicator of potential price decline. While Apple is a large, established company, the specific concerns raised by Jefferies are substantial.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a clear majority leaning towards a price fall.  Considering the weight of the negative news and the consensus of previous predictions, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the possibility of a price rise is not entirely ruled out, as the market's reaction might be less severe than the analyst's prediction, or the negative news might already be partially priced in.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about slower adoption of AI. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has underperformed recently, trading at high valuation multiples. The InvestingPro Fair Value models suggest a potential downside of -15.5%. Additionally, previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Jim Cramer sold some of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio. He also expressed concerns that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. These negative sentiments suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term decrease in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that Apple's strong brand and overall market position could mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on the information provided and the previous predictions from various models, there seems to be a consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding a significant stake but reducing its position due to valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth, as well as the safety of its dividend. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the mixed tone of the article, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio, concerns about missing the next quarter's results, and potential downgrades before the earnings report. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from various models also predominantly indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, considering the negative outlook and historical predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is relatively low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc.

While Buffett maintains a large stake, the significant reduction in Berkshire's position due to valuation concerns is a key negative signal. Slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks are also concerning. The strength of the services sector offers some support, but the overall tone and the consensus of previous predictions lean towards a price fall. The 'Double Down' advertisement is irrelevant. Considering the trend of negative predictions and the article's cautious conclusion, a price fall is more likely, but the strong services sector and Buffett's continued holding provide some support, preventing an extremely bearish outlook. The previous rounds of predictions consistently show a higher probability of the stock price falling, reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses heavily on a Jefferies downgrade of Apple to 'Underperform', citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI adoption, and missed revenue growth guidance.  This is a significant negative factor, supported by a projected 13% downside from the new price target.  While Apple's size and established position offer some resilience, the specific concerns raised are substantial.  Previous predictions consistently show a majority leaning towards a price fall, reflecting a consensus of negative sentiment.  Although Apple's services sector remains strong, and Warren Buffett's continued (though reduced) holding offers some counterbalance, the weight of negative news and analyst consensus strongly suggests a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. The previous rounds' predictions show a clear trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.
