(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in a company often signals confidence in its long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the headline does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or market conditions, which could also impact stock price movement. Given Buffett's reputation and the general positive perception of dividend-paying stocks, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth, as well as the safety of its dividend. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is irrelevant to the analysis of this specific news piece.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jefferies downgraded Apple to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and a missed revenue growth guidance.  The downgrade implies a 13% downside. While the news is overwhelmingly negative, Apple is a large, established company, and a 13% drop is not necessarily catastrophic.  The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh this specific negative outlook against Apple's overall strength and long-term prospects.  Given the significant negative sentiment expressed by Jefferies, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the probability of a price rise is not zero, as the market may not fully agree with Jefferies' assessment or may already have priced in some of the negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several headwinds for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about its slower adoption of AI. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has underperformed recently, trading at high valuation multiples. The InvestingPro Fair Value models suggest a potential downside of -15.5%. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, has expressed concerns about Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) future performance, stating that he believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. He mentioned that he sold some of his Apple stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expects the stock to go lower. Cramer also noted that there may be downgrades ahead of the quarter report, which could further impact the stock price negatively. Given Cramer's influence and the specific nature of his comments, there is a higher likelihood of a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock. The article highlights that Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has reduced its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022, primarily due to the stock's stretched valuation. Apple's recent performance has been modest, with trailing-12-month revenue rising by only 1.3% over the past three years. However, the company's high-margin service sales are growing, and it has a strong ability to generate free cash flow. The article concludes that while holding some Apple shares is still a good idea, buying the richly valued stock now may not be the best decision. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the article presents more cautionary arguments against buying the stock at its current valuation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of their portfolio. He expressed concern that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. Given these negative sentiments, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the context of Buffett reducing his stake raises concerns about valuation and future growth. Previous analyses indicate a mix of negative sentiment due to slowing revenue growth, high valuation multiples, and potential downgrades from analysts. While Buffett's involvement may provide some support, the overall tone of the news and previous predictions leans towards caution. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term, but not without some chance of a rise due to Buffett's endorsement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. While Buffett holds a large stake, Berkshire has significantly reduced its position due to valuation concerns. Revenue growth is slow, but the services sector is growing. The article concludes it's not a buy now. Previous predictions lean towards a price fall, citing valuation and potential downgrades. Considering the article's cautious tone and the trend of negative predictions, a price fall is more likely, but the strong services sector and Buffett's continued holding provide some support.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on a Jefferies downgrade of Apple to Underperform, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI adoption, and missed revenue growth guidance.  This is a significant negative factor.  The projected 13% downside from the new price target is a strong indicator of potential price decline. While Apple is a large, established company, the specific concerns raised by Jefferies are substantial.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a clear majority leaning towards a price fall.  Considering the weight of the negative news and the consensus of previous predictions, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the possibility of a price rise is not entirely ruled out, as the market's reaction might be less severe than the analyst's prediction, or the negative news might already be partially priced in.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about slower adoption of AI. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has underperformed recently, trading at high valuation multiples. The InvestingPro Fair Value models suggest a potential downside of -15.5%. Additionally, previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Jim Cramer sold some of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio. He also expressed concerns that Apple might miss its next quarter's results and that there could be further analyst downgrades. These negative sentiments suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term decrease in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that Apple's strong brand and overall market position could mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on the information provided and the previous predictions from various models, there seems to be a consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding a significant stake but reducing its position due to valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth, as well as the safety of its dividend. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the mixed tone of the article, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio, concerns about missing the next quarter's results, and potential downgrades before the earnings report. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from various models also predominantly indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, considering the negative outlook and historical predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is relatively low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) typically signals confidence in the company's long-term prospects, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the context of Buffett reducing his stake raises concerns about valuation and future growth. Previous analyses indicate a mix of negative sentiment due to slowing revenue growth, high valuation multiples, and potential downgrades from analysts. While Buffett's involvement may provide some support, the overall tone of the news and previous predictions leans towards caution.

While Buffett maintains a large stake, the significant reduction in Berkshire's position due to valuation concerns is a key negative signal. Slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks are also concerning. The strength of the services sector offers some support, but the overall tone and the consensus of previous predictions lean towards a price fall. The 'Double Down' advertisement is irrelevant. Considering the trend of negative predictions and the article's cautious conclusion, a price fall is more likely, but the strong services sector and Buffett's continued holding provide some support, preventing an extremely bearish outlook. The previous rounds of predictions consistently show a higher probability of the stock price falling, reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses heavily on a Jefferies downgrade of Apple to 'Underperform', citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI adoption, and missed revenue growth guidance.  This is a significant negative factor, supported by a projected 13% downside from the new price target.  While Apple's size and established position offer some resilience, the specific concerns raised are substantial.  Previous predictions consistently show a majority leaning towards a price fall, reflecting a consensus of negative sentiment.  Although Apple's services sector remains strong, and Warren Buffett's continued (though reduced) holding offers some counterbalance, the weight of negative news and analyst consensus strongly suggests a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. The previous rounds' predictions show a clear trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.
