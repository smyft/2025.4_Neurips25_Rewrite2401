(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, has sold some of his Apple stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio and expresses a belief that the company will miss its upcoming quarterly results. This sentiment suggests a bearish outlook on AAPL, which could lead to increased selling pressure. Additionally, Cramer's comments about potential downgrades from analysts further support the likelihood of a price decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his large stake suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. This could attract other investors, potentially driving up the stock price. However, the article also poses the question 'Is It a Buy Now?', which implies that the current valuation might already reflect this positive sentiment. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio.  While he anticipates Apple missing its quarterly earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's historical performance of rising after downgrades. This creates a mixed signal.  The fact that he's selling due to portfolio management rather than a negative outlook on the company itself is a mitigating factor. However, his prediction of a missed quarter and subsequent price drop carries significant weight given his influence.  The overall sentiment is slightly bearish, but not overwhelmingly so. The article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks, indirectly suggesting a shift in investment focus away from Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to Underperform with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap further contribute to the bearish outlook. Given the substantial downgrade and the reasons cited, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies that are defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite pressure from conservative groups and the current US administration. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies that has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal encouraging the assessment of risks from its DEI programs. This suggests that Apple is committed to its DEI policies and is willing to take a stance against potential backlash. Given this information, it is likely that Apple's stock price will be positively affected by this news, as investors may view the company's commitment to DEI as a positive aspect of its corporate culture and values. However, there is also a possibility that some investors may react negatively to Apple's stance, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, has sold some of his Apple stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio and expresses a belief that the company will miss its upcoming quarterly results. This sentiment suggests a bearish outlook on AAPL, which could lead to increased selling pressure. Additionally, Cramer's comments about potential downgrades from analysts further support the likelihood of a price decline. While there are mixed signals regarding Apple's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment from Cramer's actions and comments leans towards a bearish outlook, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\", suggests the market may have already priced in this information. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative news from Jim Cramer or Jefferies downgrades, while others highlighted Buffett's investment or positive market sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the fact that Buffett's position is well-known, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not significantly. The previous rounds show a trend of fluctuating opinions, so I'll adjust my prediction to reflect a more balanced view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing, coupled with his prediction of a missed earnings quarter and potential analyst downgrades. While he acknowledges Apple's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, the immediate impact of his actions and prediction points towards a negative sentiment.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning bearish (0.25-0.75 rise/fall probabilities) and others more bullish (0.6-0.4 rise/fall probabilities).  However, the consistent theme across the bearish predictions is the weight given to Cramer's sell-off and earnings miss prediction.  Considering the influence of Cramer and the potential for negative market reaction to a missed earnings report, a slightly bearish outlook is warranted.  The fact that the sell-off is due to portfolio management and not a fundamental shift in Cramer's view of Apple mitigates the negative impact somewhat, preventing an overwhelmingly bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Underperform due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade comes with a price target implying a 13% downside, which suggests significant negative sentiment. Additionally, industry checks point to delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for the iPhone, further contributing to the bearish outlook. Given the substantial downgrade and the reasons cited, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. This aligns with the majority of previous predictions, which also leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings on Thursday, which is a significant event. The overall market sentiment has been positive, with the S&P 500 and tech indexes rallying. However, the Fed meeting and Trump's policies could introduce volatility. Given that Apple's earnings report is a crucial event and the current positive market trend, there is a balanced but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies that are defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite pressure from conservative groups and the current US administration. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies that has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal encouraging the assessment of risks from its DEI programs.

However, there is also a possibility that some investors may react negatively to Apple's stance, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment, but the overall trend seems to be slightly bearish.
