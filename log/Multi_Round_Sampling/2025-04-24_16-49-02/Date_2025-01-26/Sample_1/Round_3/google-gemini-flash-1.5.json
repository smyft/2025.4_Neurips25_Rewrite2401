(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, has sold some of his Apple stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio and expresses a belief that the company will miss its upcoming quarterly results. This sentiment suggests a bearish outlook on AAPL, which could lead to increased selling pressure. Additionally, Cramer's comments about potential downgrades from analysts further support the likelihood of a price decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his large stake suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. This could attract other investors, potentially driving up the stock price. However, the article also poses the question 'Is It a Buy Now?', which implies that the current valuation might already reflect this positive sentiment. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio.  While he anticipates Apple missing its quarterly earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's historical performance of rising after downgrades. This creates a mixed signal.  The fact that he's selling due to portfolio management rather than a negative outlook on the company itself is a mitigating factor. However, his prediction of a missed quarter and subsequent price drop carries significant weight given his influence.  The overall sentiment is slightly bearish, but not overwhelmingly so. The article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks, indirectly suggesting a shift in investment focus away from Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to Underperform with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap further contribute to the bearish outlook. Given the substantial downgrade and the reasons cited, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies that are defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite pressure from conservative groups and the current US administration. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies that has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal encouraging the assessment of risks from its DEI programs. This suggests that Apple is committed to its DEI policies and is willing to take a stance against potential backlash. Given this information, it is likely that Apple's stock price will be positively affected by this news, as investors may view the company's commitment to DEI as a positive aspect of its corporate culture and values. However, there is also a possibility that some investors may react negatively to Apple's stance, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, has sold some of his Apple stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio and expresses a belief that the company will miss its upcoming quarterly results. This sentiment suggests a bearish outlook on AAPL, which could lead to increased selling pressure. Additionally, Cramer's comments about potential downgrades from analysts further support the likelihood of a price decline. While there are mixed signals regarding Apple's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment from Cramer's actions and comments leans towards a bearish outlook, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\", suggests the market may have already priced in this information. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative news from Jim Cramer or Jefferies downgrades, while others highlighted Buffett's investment or positive market sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the fact that Buffett's position is well-known, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not significantly. The previous rounds show a trend of fluctuating opinions, so I'll adjust my prediction to reflect a more balanced view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing, coupled with his prediction of a missed earnings quarter and potential analyst downgrades. While he acknowledges Apple's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, the immediate impact of his actions and prediction points towards a negative sentiment.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning bearish (0.25-0.75 rise/fall probabilities) and others more bullish (0.6-0.4 rise/fall probabilities).  However, the consistent theme across the bearish predictions is the weight given to Cramer's sell-off and earnings miss prediction.  Considering the influence of Cramer and the potential for negative market reaction to a missed earnings report, a slightly bearish outlook is warranted.  The fact that the sell-off is due to portfolio management and not a fundamental shift in Cramer's view of Apple mitigates the negative impact somewhat, preventing an overwhelmingly bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Underperform due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade comes with a price target implying a 13% downside, which suggests significant negative sentiment. Additionally, industry checks point to delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for the iPhone, further contributing to the bearish outlook. Given the substantial downgrade and the reasons cited, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. This aligns with the majority of previous predictions, which also leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings on Thursday, which is a significant event. The overall market sentiment has been positive, with the S&P 500 and tech indexes rallying. However, the Fed meeting and Trump's policies could introduce volatility. Given that Apple's earnings report is a crucial event and the current positive market trend, there is a balanced but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies that are defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite pressure from conservative groups and the current US administration.

However, there is also a possibility that some investors may react negatively to Apple's stance, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment, but the overall trend seems to be slightly bearish. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration.

However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings. However, the bearish sentiments expressed by some analysts and commentators could temper this optimism.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to Jim Cramer's decision to sell some of his stock, citing it had become too large a part of his portfolio and predicting a miss on upcoming quarterly results. This suggests a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance. Additionally, the mention of potential downgrades from analysts further supports a negative outlook. While there are mixed signals from other analysts regarding Apple's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment leans towards a decline in stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\", suggests the market may have already priced in this information. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative news from Jim Cramer or Jefferies downgrades, while others highlighted Buffett's investment or positive market sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the fact that Buffett's position is well-known, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not significantly. The previous rounds show a trend of fluctuating opinions, so I'll adjust my prediction to reflect a more balanced view. However, the fact that Buffett already has a large position mitigates the impact of this news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed. Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, sold some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing, but also predicted a missed earnings quarter and potential downgrades.  This bearish sentiment is countered by the generally positive market sentiment and the fact that Cramer's sell-off was for portfolio management reasons, not a fundamental shift in his view of Apple.  Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from strongly bearish to moderately bullish.  Considering the conflicting signals and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative news, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, slightly leaning towards a price fall due to the weight given to Cramer's prediction of a missed earnings quarter. The historical tendency of Apple to rise after downgrades is also a factor, but the immediate impact of Cramer's actions and prediction is likely to be more significant in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Jefferies to Underperform with a price target implying a 13% downside, citing weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. This significant negative sentiment, combined with industry checks pointing to delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap, suggests a bearish outlook. Previous predictions also leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-70% chance of a decline. While there are some mixed signals, the immediate impact of the downgrade and the reasons cited strongly support a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings on Thursday, which is a significant event. The overall market sentiment has been positive, with the S&P 500 and tech indexes rallying. However, the Fed meeting and Trump's policies could introduce volatility. Given that Apple's earnings report is a crucial event and the current positive market trend, there is a balanced but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price. Considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds, with some leaning bearish due to Cramer's sell-off and potential earnings miss, and others bullish due to positive market sentiment and Buffett's investment, a balanced view is warranted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of them. Despite potential backlash, Apple's commitment to DEI might be viewed positively by investors, contributing to a potential stock price rise. However, mixed signals from previous predictions and the possibility of negative reactions to Apple's stance suggest a balanced outlook. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which showed a range of opinions from slightly bearish to slightly bullish, and the current news context, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term movement.
