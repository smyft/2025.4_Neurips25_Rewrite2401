(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Street Calls of the Week\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, has sold some of his Apple stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio and expresses a belief that the company will miss its upcoming quarterly results. This sentiment suggests a bearish outlook on AAPL, which could lead to increased selling pressure. Additionally, Cramer's comments about potential downgrades from analysts further support the likelihood of a price decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his large stake suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. This could attract other investors, potentially driving up the stock price. However, the article also poses the question 'Is It a Buy Now?', which implies that the current valuation might already reflect this positive sentiment. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio.  While he anticipates Apple missing its quarterly earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's historical performance of rising after downgrades. This creates a mixed signal.  The fact that he's selling due to portfolio management rather than a negative outlook on the company itself is a mitigating factor. However, his prediction of a missed quarter and subsequent price drop carries significant weight given his influence.  The overall sentiment is slightly bearish, but not overwhelmingly so. The article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks, indirectly suggesting a shift in investment focus away from Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to Underperform with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap further contribute to the bearish outlook. Given the substantial downgrade and the reasons cited, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies that are defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite pressure from conservative groups and the current US administration. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies that has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal encouraging the assessment of risks from its DEI programs. This suggests that Apple is committed to its DEI policies and is willing to take a stance against potential backlash. Given this information, it is likely that Apple's stock price will be positively affected by this news, as investors may view the company's commitment to DEI as a positive aspect of its corporate culture and values. However, there is also a possibility that some investors may react negatively to Apple's stance, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, has sold some of his Apple stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio and expresses a belief that the company will miss its upcoming quarterly results. This sentiment suggests a bearish outlook on AAPL, which could lead to increased selling pressure. Additionally, Cramer's comments about potential downgrades from analysts further support the likelihood of a price decline. While there are mixed signals regarding Apple's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment from Cramer's actions and comments leans towards a bearish outlook, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\", suggests the market may have already priced in this information. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative news from Jim Cramer or Jefferies downgrades, while others highlighted Buffett's investment or positive market sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the fact that Buffett's position is well-known, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not significantly. The previous rounds show a trend of fluctuating opinions, so I'll adjust my prediction to reflect a more balanced view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing, coupled with his prediction of a missed earnings quarter and potential analyst downgrades. While he acknowledges Apple's historical tendency to rise after downgrades, the immediate impact of his actions and prediction points towards a negative sentiment.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning bearish (0.25-0.75 rise/fall probabilities) and others more bullish (0.6-0.4 rise/fall probabilities).  However, the consistent theme across the bearish predictions is the weight given to Cramer's sell-off and earnings miss prediction.  Considering the influence of Cramer and the potential for negative market reaction to a missed earnings report, a slightly bearish outlook is warranted.  The fact that the sell-off is due to portfolio management and not a fundamental shift in Cramer's view of Apple mitigates the negative impact somewhat, preventing an overwhelmingly bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Underperform due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade comes with a price target implying a 13% downside, which suggests significant negative sentiment. Additionally, industry checks point to delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for the iPhone, further contributing to the bearish outlook. Given the substantial downgrade and the reasons cited, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. This aligns with the majority of previous predictions, which also leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings on Thursday, which is a significant event. The overall market sentiment has been positive, with the S&P 500 and tech indexes rallying. However, the Fed meeting and Trump's policies could introduce volatility. Given that Apple's earnings report is a crucial event and the current positive market trend, there is a balanced but slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies that are defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite pressure from conservative groups and the current US administration.

However, there is also a possibility that some investors may react negatively to Apple's stance, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment, but the overall trend seems to be slightly bearish. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration.

However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings. However, the bearish sentiments expressed by some analysts and commentators could temper this optimism.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to Jim Cramer's decision to sell some of his stock, citing it had become too large a part of his portfolio and predicting a miss on upcoming quarterly results. This suggests a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance. Additionally, the mention of potential downgrades from analysts further supports a negative outlook. While there are mixed signals from other analysts regarding Apple's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment leans towards a decline in stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline's question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\", suggests the market may have already priced in this information. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Some models focused on negative news from Jim Cramer or Jefferies downgrades, while others highlighted Buffett's investment or positive market sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the fact that Buffett's position is well-known, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not significantly. The previous rounds show a trend of fluctuating opinions, so I'll adjust my prediction to reflect a more balanced view. However, the fact that Buffett already has a large position mitigates the impact of this news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed. Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, sold some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing, but also predicted a missed earnings quarter and potential downgrades.  This bearish sentiment is countered by the generally positive market sentiment and the fact that Cramer's sell-off was for portfolio management reasons, not a fundamental shift in his view of Apple.  Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from strongly bearish to moderately bullish.  Considering the conflicting signals and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative news, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, slightly leaning towards a price fall due to the weight given to Cramer's prediction of a missed earnings quarter. The historical tendency of Apple to rise after downgrades is also a factor, but the immediate impact of Cramer's actions and prediction is likely to be more significant in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Jefferies to Underperform with a price target implying a 13% downside, citing weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. This significant negative sentiment, combined with industry checks pointing to delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap, suggests a bearish outlook. Previous predictions also leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-70% chance of a decline. While there are some mixed signals, the immediate impact of the downgrade and the reasons cited strongly support a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office.

Considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds, with some leaning bearish due to Cramer's sell-off and potential earnings miss, and others bullish due to positive market sentiment and Buffett's investment, a balanced view is warranted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of them. Despite potential backlash, Apple's commitment to DEI might be viewed positively by investors, contributing to a potential stock price rise. However, mixed signals from previous predictions and the possibility of negative reactions to Apple's stance suggest a balanced outlook. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which showed a range of opinions from slightly bearish to slightly bullish, and the current news context, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration.
