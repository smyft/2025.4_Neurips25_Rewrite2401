(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures. This stance may resonate positively with investors who value corporate social responsibility, potentially leading to a favorable perception of the company. However, the political climate and the potential for backlash from conservative groups could introduce volatility. Overall, the strong support for DEI from Apple and its alignment with other major firms like Costco may bolster investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, it has been reducing its position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple. Overall, the negative aspects (valuation concerns, slowing growth, Buffett's selling) outweigh the positive (services growth, dividend potential), suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple's stock holdings due to Apple's high valuation relative to its recent performance. While Apple's service revenue is growing, overall revenue and free cash flow growth are sluggish.  The article concludes that Apple's current valuation is high, making it a less attractive buy.  Although Apple has a growing services segment and a substantial cash flow, the negative sentiment from Buffett's actions and the analysis of Apple's valuation outweigh the positive aspects. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which is often seen as a strong vote of confidence from one of the world's most respected investors. Buffett's investment style is long-term and value-oriented, which may attract positive attention from other investors. Additionally, Apple's status as a dividend-paying stock adds to its appeal for income-focused investors. Given Buffett's influence and the positive sentiment surrounding his investments, this news is likely to be viewed favorably by the market, potentially leading to increased demand for Apple's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, with Apple being the largest holding in their portfolio. Despite a 25% reduction in Apple's stake by Berkshire, the article highlights Apple's steady growth in earnings and its potential for high-margin service sales. However, it also mentions that the stock's valuation is stretched at about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, and its recent performance shows a mismatch between valuation and growth. The article concludes that while Apple's device sales are not growing rapidly, its growing array of services could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years. The stock's current valuation and stagnant sales and profits make its future performance uncertain, but the steadily growing dividend payments provide a buffer. Based on the analysis, the stock seems to be in a precarious situation with potential for both growth and decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision on the stock market. The article also mentions the positive start to the year for the S&P 500 and the potential for the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks to drive earnings growth. Given the positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings growth from Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the uncertainty surrounding the Fed's decision and potential market volatility also assigns a non-zero probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that Warren Buffett, a well-known and respected investor, has invested a significant amount ($69.9 billion) in Apple Inc. (AAPL). This could be interpreted positively by the market as it suggests that a prominent investor has confidence in the company's future prospects. However, the headline is posed as a question asking if it is a 'Buy Now?', which might indicate some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment from Warren Buffett's investment is likely to have a stronger influence on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which contrasts with the trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures. This commitment may resonate positively with investors who value corporate social responsibility, potentially leading to a favorable perception of the company. However, the political climate and potential backlash from conservative groups could introduce volatility. Given that Apple is standing firm alongside other major firms like Costco, this may bolster investor confidence. While there are concerns about valuation and slowing growth, the overall sentiment from the news suggests a higher probability of stock price rise as investors may appreciate Apple's stance on DEI amidst a challenging environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. While Buffett holds a large stake, he has significantly reduced it due to valuation concerns. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks, but also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business. The conclusion is that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, but a slight tendency towards a price rise. However, the core message of the article leans negative, focusing on overvaluation and slowing growth. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the mixed signals and previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While Warren Buffett's significant investment is positive, his substantial reduction of the stake due to valuation concerns is a major negative.  Apple's slow revenue growth and reliance on buybacks to boost EPS are also concerning.  The positive aspects are the growing services segment and the potential for future growth in this area, along with a relatively safe dividend. However, the overall sentiment leans negative due to the valuation concerns and Buffett's actions.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion, with some models emphasizing the positive aspects of Buffett's investment and others focusing on the valuation concerns and slowing growth.  I'm weighting the negative factors more heavily given the direct quote from the article about valuation concerns and the fact that Buffett, a renowned value investor, is actively reducing his position. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, but the majority lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, which aligns with my assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is generally seen as a strong vote of confidence from a highly respected investor. This could attract positive attention from other investors, especially those who follow Buffett's value-oriented, long-term investment strategy. Additionally, Apple's status as a dividend-paying stock adds to its appeal for income-focused investors. However, the article also raises questions about whether Apple is a 'Buy Now,' suggesting some uncertainty or caution. Given Buffett's influence and the positive sentiment surrounding his investments, the market is likely to view this news favorably, but the lingering uncertainty may temper the enthusiasm slightly. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions, where some models leaned positive and others negative, the overall sentiment appears cautiously optimistic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

However, there are mixed sentiments based on previous predictions. Some models predict a potential rise due to Buffett's influence, while others point towards valuation concerns and stagnant growth. Considering the balance between positive signals (Buffett's investment) and negative signals (valuation concerns, slowing growth), it seems prudent to lean slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, given the historical success and future potential of Apple's service sector.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which contrasts with many companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures.

While Buffett's large holding initially suggests confidence, the significant reduction in his stake due to valuation concerns is a strong negative signal. Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks are also concerning. However, the growing services segment and potential for future growth offer some positive counterpoints.

While Warren Buffett's massive investment is a positive signal, his significant reduction of his stake due to valuation concerns is a major negative.  This is compounded by the article's highlighting of slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks to boost EPS.  The positive aspects are the growing services segment and the potential for future growth in this area, along with a relatively safe dividend. However, the overall sentiment leans negative due to the valuation concerns and Buffett's actions.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation.  Considering the weight of the negative factors (valuation concerns, slowing growth, Buffett selling), and the fact that Buffett, a renowned value investor, is actively reducing his position, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall. However, the substantial existing investment and the potential for service revenue growth prevent this probability from being overwhelmingly high.  The previous rounds' predictions show a trend towards a slightly lower probability of a price rise over time, which supports this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc.

The article also mentions the positive start to the year for the S&P 500 and the potential for the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks to drive earnings growth. Given the positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings growth from Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the uncertainty surrounding the Fed's decision and potential market volatility also assigns a non-zero probability to the stock price falling.

The fact that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks expected to drive earnings growth, combined with the overall positive start to the year for the S&P 500, supports a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.57,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.43\n}\n```"
