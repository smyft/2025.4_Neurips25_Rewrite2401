(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Warren Buffett Has $69.9 Billion Invested in This Dividend-Paying Stock. Is It a Buy Now?\nNews Content: There are many ways to get rich on Wall Street, but none seem as reliable as the strategies employed by Warren Buffett. The legendary investor took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965. Over the past six decades, the stock has delivered a 19.6% average annual gain.\n\nThere aren't any secrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.\n\nWe can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 million Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.\n\nApple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.\n\nWhy Buffett sold heaps of Apple shares\n\nBuffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top of Berkshire's portfolio if he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.\n\nBerkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.AAPL Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.\n\nTrailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.\n\nA mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.\n\nWhy holding some Apple shares is still a good idea\n\nInvestors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue.\u00a0While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.\n\nThe bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.\n\nNot time to buy\n\nApple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It a Buy Now? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies amidst a broader trend of companies retreating from such initiatives due to political pressures. This stance may resonate positively with investors who value corporate social responsibility, potentially leading to a favorable perception of the company. However, the political climate and the potential for backlash from conservative groups could introduce volatility. Overall, the strong support for DEI from Apple and its alignment with other major firms like Costco may bolster investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, it has been reducing its position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple. Overall, the negative aspects (valuation concerns, slowing growth, Buffett's selling) outweigh the positive (services growth, dividend potential), suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple's stock holdings due to Apple's high valuation relative to its recent performance. While Apple's service revenue is growing, overall revenue and free cash flow growth are sluggish.  The article concludes that Apple's current valuation is high, making it a less attractive buy.  Although Apple has a growing services segment and a substantial cash flow, the negative sentiment from Buffett's actions and the analysis of Apple's valuation outweigh the positive aspects. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which is often seen as a strong vote of confidence from one of the world's most respected investors. Buffett's investment style is long-term and value-oriented, which may attract positive attention from other investors. Additionally, Apple's status as a dividend-paying stock adds to its appeal for income-focused investors. Given Buffett's influence and the positive sentiment surrounding his investments, this news is likely to be viewed favorably by the market, potentially leading to increased demand for Apple's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, with Apple being the largest holding in their portfolio. Despite a 25% reduction in Apple's stake by Berkshire, the article highlights Apple's steady growth in earnings and its potential for high-margin service sales. However, it also mentions that the stock's valuation is stretched at about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, and its recent performance shows a mismatch between valuation and growth. The article concludes that while Apple's device sales are not growing rapidly, its growing array of services could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years. The stock's current valuation and stagnant sales and profits make its future performance uncertain, but the steadily growing dividend payments provide a buffer. Based on the analysis, the stock seems to be in a precarious situation with potential for both growth and decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision on the stock market. The article also mentions the positive start to the year for the S&P 500 and the potential for the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks to drive earnings growth. Given the positive sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings growth from Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the uncertainty surrounding the Fed's decision and potential market volatility also assigns a non-zero probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that Warren Buffett, a well-known and respected investor, has invested a significant amount ($69.9 billion) in Apple Inc. (AAPL). This could be interpreted positively by the market as it suggests that a prominent investor has confidence in the company's future prospects. However, the headline is posed as a question asking if it is a 'Buy Now?', which might indicate some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment from Warren Buffett's investment is likely to have a stronger influence on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
