(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Street Calls of the Week\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in a company often signals confidence in its long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the headline does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or market conditions, which could also impact stock price movement. Given Buffett's reputation and the general positive perception of dividend-paying stocks, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal by the market. Buffett's investment decisions are often seen as endorsements of a company's long-term value and stability. This can lead to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock. However, the headline is phrased as a question ('Is It a Buy Now?'), which introduces some uncertainty. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is already well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a potential shift in the political climate.  While some companies are retreating from DEI programs, Apple's stance, similar to Costco's successful defense, suggests resilience and a belief in the long-term value of diversity.  The article mentions Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on a similar proposal, and a positive outcome (as seen with Costco) would likely be viewed favorably by investors. However, the overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors could still influence Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price rise is therefore moderate, while the probability of a fall is relatively low, given the specific context of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Jefferies from a neutral or higher rating to 'Underperform' with a price target of $200.75, implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations that Apple will miss its revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades, especially from reputable firms, often lead to negative sentiment among investors, potentially resulting in a stock price decline. Given the specific concerns raised about iPhone sales and AI commercialization delays, the likelihood of a negative impact on the stock price is significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has $69.9 billion invested in a dividend-paying stock, and the implication is that this stock could be a good buy now. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a well-known dividend-paying stock and a significant holding for many major investors, there's a positive sentiment that could be inferred from Buffett's investment. However, the news does not exclusively mention Apple Inc., which is crucial for a direct impact assessment. Assuming the stock in question is Apple, the news could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive the stock price up. But without explicit confirmation that the stock is AAPL, the impact might be muted. Therefore, there's a higher probability of a stock price rise due to the positive sentiment associated with Buffett's investment, but also a consideration for a potential fall if investors interpret this as speculative or if the stock isn't AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. Meta Platforms is expected to report strong earnings and revenue growth, driven by its aggressive push into AI and expanding user base. In contrast, Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which may lead to disappointing earnings and guidance. Based on this analysis, the probability of Meta Platforms' stock price rising is higher, while the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is currently trading below recent levels. The implied volatility suggests a significant price movement, but given the negative sentiment and the recent analyst downgrades, the likelihood of a price fall is higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
