(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in a company often signals confidence in its long-term prospects, which can positively influence investor sentiment and lead to a rise in stock price. However, the headline does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or market conditions, which could also impact stock price movement. Given Buffett's reputation and the general positive perception of dividend-paying stocks, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which is generally perceived as a positive signal by the market. Buffett's investment decisions are often seen as endorsements of a company's long-term value and stability. This can lead to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock. However, the headline is phrased as a question ('Is It a Buy Now?'), which introduces some uncertainty. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Buffett's position is already well-known. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a potential shift in the political climate.  While some companies are retreating from DEI programs, Apple's stance, similar to Costco's successful defense, suggests resilience and a belief in the long-term value of diversity.  The article mentions Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on a similar proposal, and a positive outcome (as seen with Costco) would likely be viewed favorably by investors. However, the overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors could still influence Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price rise is therefore moderate, while the probability of a fall is relatively low, given the specific context of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Jefferies from a neutral or higher rating to 'Underperform' with a price target of $200.75, implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations that Apple will miss its revenue growth guidance. Such analyst downgrades, especially from reputable firms, often lead to negative sentiment among investors, potentially resulting in a stock price decline. Given the specific concerns raised about iPhone sales and AI commercialization delays, the likelihood of a negative impact on the stock price is significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has $69.9 billion invested in a dividend-paying stock, and the implication is that this stock could be a good buy now. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a well-known dividend-paying stock and a significant holding for many major investors, there's a positive sentiment that could be inferred from Buffett's investment. However, the news does not exclusively mention Apple Inc., which is crucial for a direct impact assessment. Assuming the stock in question is Apple, the news could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive the stock price up. But without explicit confirmation that the stock is AAPL, the impact might be muted. Therefore, there's a higher probability of a stock price rise due to the positive sentiment associated with Buffett's investment, but also a consideration for a potential fall if investors interpret this as speculative or if the stock isn't AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. Meta Platforms is expected to report strong earnings and revenue growth, driven by its aggressive push into AI and expanding user base. In contrast, Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which may lead to disappointing earnings and guidance. Based on this analysis, the probability of Meta Platforms' stock price rising is higher, while the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is currently trading below recent levels. The implied volatility suggests a significant price movement, but given the negative sentiment and the recent analyst downgrades, the likelihood of a price fall is higher.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple Inc. is generally perceived as a strong endorsement of the company's long-term value, which can positively influence investor sentiment. This news could lead to increased demand for the stock, especially among retail investors who often follow Buffett's investment strategies. However, the phrasing of the headline as a question ('Is It a Buy Now?') introduces some uncertainty, suggesting that not all investors may view this as a clear buy signal. Additionally, previous predictions indicate a mix of sentiment, with some analysts expressing concerns about Apple's performance, particularly regarding iPhone sales and innovation. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Buffett's influence, but with a notable chance of a decline given the mixed sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which is generally a positive signal. However, the headline is phrased as a question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\", which introduces some uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions. Some models see Buffett's investment as a strong positive signal, while others focus on potential headwinds for Apple. The trend seems to be slightly leaning towards a positive impact, but not overwhelmingly so. Given this, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more positive outlook than a neutral one, but not as high as the initial predictions. I will also consider the trend of the previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's (AAPL) stance on DEI initiatives, contrasting it with other companies retreating from such programs.  Apple's continued commitment, similar to Costco's successful defense against a similar shareholder proposal, could be viewed positively by investors who value ESG factors. However, the news doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects. The upcoming shareholder vote on a DEI-related proposal adds uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of direct financial news, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's stock price movement.  Given the lack of strong positive or negative drivers in this specific news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome (no significant change), which is reflected in probabilities close to 0.5 for both rise and fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Jefferies to Underperform with a price target implying a 13% downside. The downgrade is based on weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations that Apple will miss its revenue growth guidance. Analyst downgrades, especially from reputable firms, often lead to negative sentiment among investors, which is likely to result in a stock price decline.

(AAPL). Warren Buffett's investment decisions are often seen as a positive signal by the market, suggesting confidence in the company's long-term prospects. However, the headline does not provide specific details about Apple's current performance or market conditions that could impact the stock price. Given Buffett's reputation and the general positive perception of dividend-paying stocks, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising. But, since the news does not exclusively and explicitly mention Apple, the impact might be somewhat muted. Considering various previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment but generally leaning positive due to Buffett's endorsement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. Meta Platforms is expected to report strong earnings and revenue growth, driven by its aggressive push into AI and expanding user base. In contrast, Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which may lead to disappointing earnings and guidance. Based on this analysis, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price fall. The news article's focus on Apple's challenges and the expected disappointing earnings and guidance further support this prediction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges facing Apple Inc., including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are leading indicators of potential underperformance. The news specifically mentions negative sentiments and analyst downgrades, suggesting a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Previous predictions from other models also indicate a higher probability of stock price falling, with reasons mainly focusing on weak iPhone sales and broader industry headwinds.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. is generally perceived as a strong endorsement of the company's long-term value, which can positively influence investor sentiment.

However, the headline is phrased as a question, \"Is It a Buy Now?\", introducing some uncertainty. Analyzing previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models see Buffett's investment as a strong positive signal, while others focus on potential headwinds for Apple, such as slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. The trend in previous predictions seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook. Considering these factors, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more balanced outlook, acknowledging both the positive influence of Buffett's investment and the potential negative factors affecting Apple's performance. The phrasing of the headline and the mixed sentiment in previous predictions suggest that the impact might not be as strong as initially perceived.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's (AAPL) steadfast commitment to DEI initiatives despite a broader trend of companies retreating due to political pressure.  While this stance could be viewed positively by some investors (particularly those prioritizing ESG factors), the news lacks direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects. The upcoming shareholder vote on a DEI-related proposal introduces further uncertainty.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the lack of a clear positive or negative driver from this specific news.  The majority of previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum.  Considering the lack of strong positive news directly impacting Apple's financials and the prevailing negative sentiment from other factors, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the possibility of a muted impact or even a slight rise due to the positive DEI stance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc.
