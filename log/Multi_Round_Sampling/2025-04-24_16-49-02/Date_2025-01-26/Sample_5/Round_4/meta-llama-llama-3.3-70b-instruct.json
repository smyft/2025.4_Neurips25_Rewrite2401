(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment given the context of the news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance fueled by Trump's policies (less focus on tariffs, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector as a whole.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments on interest rates and future policy could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks.  The overall economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also carry uncertainty. While Apple's earnings are highly anticipated, a miss or weaker-than-expected guidance could trigger a price drop.  Given the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher, but the uncertainty surrounding the Fed and economic data makes a significant price movement in either direction plausible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news which highlights several factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news mentions headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about waning demand in China. Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5% according to InvestingPro. The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has $69.9 billion invested in a dividend-paying stock, and the implication is that this stock could be a good buy now. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a well-known dividend-paying stock and a major holding in many portfolios, including potentially Warren Buffett's, this news could have a positive impact on investor sentiment. The mention of Warren Buffett, a highly respected investor, having a significant investment in the stock could lead to increased confidence among other investors, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the news does not exclusively mention Apple, so the impact might be less direct than if the company was explicitly named. Nonetheless, given Apple's prominence and assuming the stock in question could be inferred to be Apple by some investors, there's a reasonable chance the stock price could rise due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. This suggests a negative outlook on the stock in the short term. However, Cramer also mentions that the stock has been a long-term winner and tends to bounce back after being downgraded. Considering this mixed sentiment, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising in the short term, but not extremely high due to the company's historical performance and potential for long-term growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives. This demonstrates Apple's commitment to progressive values and inclusivity, which is likely to resonate positively with its stakeholders, particularly investors who value socially responsible investments. Given Apple's prominence and influence in the tech industry, this commitment can further enhance its brand reputation, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment given the context of the news. Furthermore, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5%. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a nuanced view of Apple's stock. While Buffett maintains a large position, Berkshire has significantly reduced its stake, primarily due to valuation concerns. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The conclusion is that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Given the valuation concerns and slowing growth, I believe the probability of a price decrease is slightly higher than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks.  Economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also introduce uncertainty.  Apple's earnings are highly anticipated, but a miss or weaker-than-expected guidance could trigger a price drop.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, coupled with the potential for strong earnings, a price rise is more likely. However, the significant downside risk from the Fed meeting and economic data necessitates a cautious approach.  The overall probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the uncertainty makes a significant movement in either direction plausible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about waning demand in China. Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5% according to InvestingPro. The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline. The only exception is the model that considered Warren Buffett's investment, but this was not directly related to the current news. Therefore, the overall sentiment is negative, suggesting a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), a dividend-paying stock, which could indicate a positive outlook for the company given Buffett's reputation and influence. However, it's essential to consider that the article does not exclusively mention Apple as the stock in question, which adds a layer of uncertainty. Despite this, if Buffett's investment is perceived to be in Apple, it could enhance investor confidence due to his successful track record. The mixed sentiments from various analysts and the general market trends suggest a cautious approach. Given these considerations, the probability of the stock price rising seems moderate but is outweighed by the potential for a decrease due to various market and economic factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. This suggests a negative outlook on the stock in the short term. However, considering the historical performance of the stock and the potential for long-term growth, as well as the mixed sentiment from other analysts and models, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives.

Given Apple's prominence and influence in the tech industry, this commitment can further enhance its brand reputation, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher stock price. The news also contrasts Apple with other companies like Target, which are ending their DEI goals, further emphasizing Apple's unique position. Although the news does not directly indicate financial performance, the positive sentiment around DEI can lead to a positive outlook on the company.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook.

These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but ultimately cautious outlook on Apple. While Buffett's large holding is a positive signal, the fact that Berkshire has significantly reduced its stake due to valuation concerns is a major red flag. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and a reliance on buybacks, which are not sustainable long-term growth drivers. The strength of the services business is a positive, but it may not be enough to offset the concerns about device sales and overall valuation. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Given the valuation concerns, slowing growth, and Buffett's reduced stake, the probability of a price decrease is higher than an increase. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis. The fact that other models have also leaned towards a negative outlook reinforces this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector.

While the overall market sentiment is positive, the potential for negative impacts from the Fed and economic data, coupled with the risk of disappointing earnings, creates significant uncertainty.  Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, a price rise is possible, but the significant downside risk makes a neutral prediction more appropriate. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly more negative outlook, but the range of predictions highlights the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing several negative factors such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about waning demand in China. Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5% according to InvestingPro. The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators and the overall sentiment from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising. However, the strong overall market performance and potential for strong Q4 earnings provide some counterbalance, though not enough to outweigh the negative factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's significant investment in a dividend-paying stock, which is likely to be Apple Inc. (AAPL) given its prominence and dividend-paying status. This association with Buffett, a highly respected investor, could enhance investor confidence and potentially drive the stock price up. However, various analysts have expressed concerns about Apple's slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and overvaluation, which could weigh on the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiments and the influence of Buffett's investment, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate but slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the aforementioned concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarter results.

The news contrasts Apple with other companies like Target, which are ending their DEI goals, further emphasizing Apple's unique position. Although the news does not directly indicate financial performance, the positive sentiment around DEI can lead to a positive outlook on the company.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and a bearish sentiment from analysts who have lowered revenue forecasts. The upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, which further contributes to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but ultimately bearish outlook for Apple. While Buffett's large holding is a positive signal, the fact that Berkshire has significantly reduced its stake due to valuation concerns is a major red flag. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and a reliance on buybacks, which are not sustainable long-term growth drivers. The strength of the services business is a positive, but it may not be enough to offset the concerns about device sales and overall valuation. The article explicitly states that it's 'Not time to buy'. Considering the trend in previous rounds, the sentiment is leaning more negatively. Therefore, the probability of a price decrease is higher than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector.  However, counterbalancing this are several significant uncertainties: the upcoming Fed meeting (Powell's comments could negatively impact the market), upcoming economic data releases (GDP, inflation), and the risk of Apple's earnings falling short of expectations or providing weak guidance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  While the overall market sentiment is positive, the potential for negative impacts from the Fed, economic data, and disappointing earnings creates significant uncertainty.  The consensus among the previous models leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the range of predictions highlights the uncertainty.  Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, a price rise is possible, but the significant downside risk makes a slightly bearish prediction more appropriate.  The fact that Apple's earnings are highly anticipated suggests a higher potential for volatility than usual.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a predominantly bearish outlook for Apple Inc.
