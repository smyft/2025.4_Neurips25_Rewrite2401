(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment given the context of the news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance fueled by Trump's policies (less focus on tariffs, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector as a whole.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments on interest rates and future policy could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks.  The overall economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also carry uncertainty. While Apple's earnings are highly anticipated, a miss or weaker-than-expected guidance could trigger a price drop.  Given the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher, but the uncertainty surrounding the Fed and economic data makes a significant price movement in either direction plausible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news which highlights several factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news mentions headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about waning demand in China. Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5% according to InvestingPro. The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has $69.9 billion invested in a dividend-paying stock, and the implication is that this stock could be a good buy now. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a well-known dividend-paying stock and a major holding in many portfolios, including potentially Warren Buffett's, this news could have a positive impact on investor sentiment. The mention of Warren Buffett, a highly respected investor, having a significant investment in the stock could lead to increased confidence among other investors, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the news does not exclusively mention Apple, so the impact might be less direct than if the company was explicitly named. Nonetheless, given Apple's prominence and assuming the stock in question could be inferred to be Apple by some investors, there's a reasonable chance the stock price could rise due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. This suggests a negative outlook on the stock in the short term. However, Cramer also mentions that the stock has been a long-term winner and tends to bounce back after being downgraded. Considering this mixed sentiment, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising in the short term, but not extremely high due to the company's historical performance and potential for long-term growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives. This demonstrates Apple's commitment to progressive values and inclusivity, which is likely to resonate positively with its stakeholders, particularly investors who value socially responsible investments. Given Apple's prominence and influence in the tech industry, this commitment can further enhance its brand reputation, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment given the context of the news. Furthermore, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5%. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a nuanced view of Apple's stock. While Buffett maintains a large position, Berkshire has significantly reduced its stake, primarily due to valuation concerns. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The conclusion is that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Given the valuation concerns and slowing growth, I believe the probability of a price decrease is slightly higher than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks.  Economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also introduce uncertainty.  Apple's earnings are highly anticipated, but a miss or weaker-than-expected guidance could trigger a price drop.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, coupled with the potential for strong earnings, a price rise is more likely. However, the significant downside risk from the Fed meeting and economic data necessitates a cautious approach.  The overall probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the uncertainty makes a significant movement in either direction plausible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.

The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline. The only exception is the model that considered Warren Buffett's investment, but this was not directly related to the current news. Therefore, the overall sentiment is negative, suggesting a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), a dividend-paying stock, which could indicate a positive outlook for the company given Buffett's reputation and influence. However, it's essential to consider that the article does not exclusively mention Apple as the stock in question, which adds a layer of uncertainty. Despite this, if Buffett's investment is perceived to be in Apple, it could enhance investor confidence due to his successful track record. The mixed sentiments from various analysts and the general market trends suggest a cautious approach. Given these considerations, the probability of the stock price rising seems moderate but is outweighed by the potential for a decrease due to various market and economic factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. This suggests a negative outlook on the stock in the short term. However, considering the historical performance of the stock and the potential for long-term growth, as well as the mixed sentiment from other analysts and models, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives.

Given Apple's prominence and influence in the tech industry, this commitment can further enhance its brand reputation, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher stock price. The news also contrasts Apple with other companies like Target, which are ending their DEI goals, further emphasizing Apple's unique position. Although the news does not directly indicate financial performance, the positive sentiment around DEI can lead to a positive outlook on the company.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook.

These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but ultimately cautious outlook on Apple. While Buffett's large holding is a positive signal, the fact that Berkshire has significantly reduced its stake due to valuation concerns is a major red flag. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and a reliance on buybacks, which are not sustainable long-term growth drivers. The strength of the services business is a positive, but it may not be enough to offset the concerns about device sales and overall valuation. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Given the valuation concerns, slowing growth, and Buffett's reduced stake, the probability of a price decrease is higher than an increase. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis. The fact that other models have also leaned towards a negative outlook reinforces this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector.

While the overall market sentiment is positive, the potential for negative impacts from the Fed and economic data, coupled with the risk of disappointing earnings, creates significant uncertainty.  Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, a price rise is possible, but the significant downside risk makes a neutral prediction more appropriate. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly more negative outlook, but the range of predictions highlights the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.

Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5% according to InvestingPro. The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators and the overall sentiment from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising. However, the strong overall market performance and potential for strong Q4 earnings provide some counterbalance, though not enough to outweigh the negative factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's significant investment in a dividend-paying stock, which is likely to be Apple Inc. (AAPL) given its prominence and dividend-paying status. This association with Buffett, a highly respected investor, could enhance investor confidence and potentially drive the stock price up. However, various analysts have expressed concerns about Apple's slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and overvaluation, which could weigh on the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiments and the influence of Buffett's investment, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate but slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the aforementioned concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

The previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives.

(AAPL), highlighting concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and a bearish sentiment from analysts who have lowered revenue forecasts. The upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, which further contributes to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but ultimately bearish outlook for Apple. While Buffett's large holding is a positive signal, the fact that Berkshire has significantly reduced its stake due to valuation concerns is a major red flag. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and a reliance on buybacks, which are not sustainable long-term growth drivers. The strength of the services business is a positive, but it may not be enough to offset the concerns about device sales and overall valuation. The article explicitly states that it's 'Not time to buy'. Considering the trend in previous rounds, the sentiment is leaning more negatively. Therefore, the probability of a price decrease is higher than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector.  However, counterbalancing this are several significant uncertainties: the upcoming Fed meeting (Powell's comments could negatively impact the market), upcoming economic data releases (GDP, inflation), and the risk of Apple's earnings falling short of expectations or providing weak guidance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  While the overall market sentiment is positive, the potential for negative impacts from the Fed, economic data, and disappointing earnings creates significant uncertainty.  The consensus among the previous models leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the range of predictions highlights the uncertainty.  Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, a price rise is possible, but the significant downside risk makes a slightly bearish prediction more appropriate.  The fact that Apple's earnings are highly anticipated suggests a higher potential for volatility than usual.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a predominantly bearish outlook for Apple Inc.

Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector. However, significant uncertainties exist: the upcoming Fed meeting (Powell's comments could negatively impact the market), upcoming economic data releases (GDP, inflation), and the risk of Apple's earnings falling short of expectations or providing weak guidance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. While the overall market sentiment is positive, the potential for negative impacts from the Fed, economic data, and disappointing earnings creates significant uncertainty. The consensus among the previous models leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the range of predictions highlights the uncertainty. Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, a price rise is possible, but the significant downside risk makes a slightly bearish prediction more appropriate. The fact that Apple's earnings are highly anticipated suggests a higher potential for volatility than usual.  Weighing the positive and negative factors, and considering the historical trend of slightly bearish predictions from various models, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```\n"
