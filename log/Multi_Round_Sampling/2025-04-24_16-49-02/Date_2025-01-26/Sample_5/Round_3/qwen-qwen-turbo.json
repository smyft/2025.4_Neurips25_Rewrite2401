(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment given the context of the news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The article concludes that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. The overall tone is slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance fueled by Trump's policies (less focus on tariffs, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector as a whole.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments on interest rates and future policy could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks.  The overall economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also carry uncertainty. While Apple's earnings are highly anticipated, a miss or weaker-than-expected guidance could trigger a price drop.  Given the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher, but the uncertainty surrounding the Fed and economic data makes a significant price movement in either direction plausible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news which highlights several factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news mentions headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about waning demand in China. Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5% according to InvestingPro. The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has $69.9 billion invested in a dividend-paying stock, and the implication is that this stock could be a good buy now. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a well-known dividend-paying stock and a major holding in many portfolios, including potentially Warren Buffett's, this news could have a positive impact on investor sentiment. The mention of Warren Buffett, a highly respected investor, having a significant investment in the stock could lead to increased confidence among other investors, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the news does not exclusively mention Apple, so the impact might be less direct than if the company was explicitly named. Nonetheless, given Apple's prominence and assuming the stock in question could be inferred to be Apple by some investors, there's a reasonable chance the stock price could rise due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. This suggests a negative outlook on the stock in the short term. However, Cramer also mentions that the stock has been a long-term winner and tends to bounce back after being downgraded. Considering this mixed sentiment, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising in the short term, but not extremely high due to the company's historical performance and potential for long-term growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives. This demonstrates Apple's commitment to progressive values and inclusivity, which is likely to resonate positively with its stakeholders, particularly investors who value socially responsible investments. Given Apple's prominence and influence in the tech industry, this commitment can further enhance its brand reputation, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment given the context of the news. Furthermore, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5%. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a nuanced view of Apple's stock. While Buffett maintains a large position, Berkshire has significantly reduced its stake, primarily due to valuation concerns. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and reliance on buybacks. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth. The conclusion is that Apple is not a buy at its current valuation. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Given the valuation concerns and slowing growth, I believe the probability of a price decrease is slightly higher than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks.  Economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also introduce uncertainty.  Apple's earnings are highly anticipated, but a miss or weaker-than-expected guidance could trigger a price drop.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, coupled with the potential for strong earnings, a price rise is more likely. However, the significant downside risk from the Fed meeting and economic data necessitates a cautious approach.  The overall probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the uncertainty makes a significant movement in either direction plausible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about waning demand in China. Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5% according to InvestingPro. The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline. The only exception is the model that considered Warren Buffett's investment, but this was not directly related to the current news. Therefore, the overall sentiment is negative, suggesting a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), a dividend-paying stock, which could indicate a positive outlook for the company given Buffett's reputation and influence. However, it's essential to consider that the article does not exclusively mention Apple as the stock in question, which adds a layer of uncertainty. Despite this, if Buffett's investment is perceived to be in Apple, it could enhance investor confidence due to his successful track record. The mixed sentiments from various analysts and the general market trends suggest a cautious approach. Given these considerations, the probability of the stock price rising seems moderate but is outweighed by the potential for a decrease due to various market and economic factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. This suggests a negative outlook on the stock in the short term. However, considering the historical performance of the stock and the potential for long-term growth, as well as the mixed sentiment from other analysts and models, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives.

Given Apple's prominence and influence in the tech industry, this commitment can further enhance its brand reputation, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher stock price. The news also contrasts Apple with other companies like Target, which are ending their DEI goals, further emphasizing Apple's unique position. Although the news does not directly indicate financial performance, the positive sentiment around DEI can lead to a positive outlook on the company.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing guidance, further contributing to a bearish outlook. The options market indicates a potential price movement of about 4.6%, suggesting uncertainty but leaning towards a negative sentiment given the context of the news. Furthermore, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5%. These factors collectively suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but ultimately cautious outlook on Apple. While Buffett's large holding is a positive signal, the fact that Berkshire has significantly reduced its stake due to valuation concerns is a major red flag. The article highlights slowing revenue growth and a reliance on buybacks, which are not sustainable long-term growth drivers. The strength of the services business is a positive, but it may not be enough to offset the concerns about device sales and overall valuation. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Given the valuation concerns, slowing growth, and Buffett's reduced stake, the probability of a price decrease is higher than an increase. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact on the analysis. The fact that other models have also leaned towards a negative outlook reinforces this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance driven by Trump's policies (reduced tariff concerns, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks. Economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also introduce uncertainty. Apple's earnings are highly anticipated, but a miss or weaker-than-expected guidance could trigger a price drop.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  While the overall market sentiment is positive, the potential for negative impacts from the Fed and economic data, coupled with the risk of disappointing earnings, creates significant uncertainty.  Considering the strong recent market performance and positive sentiment towards tech, a price rise is possible, but the significant downside risk makes a neutral prediction more appropriate. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly more negative outlook, but the range of predictions highlights the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing several negative factors such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about waning demand in China. Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5% according to InvestingPro. The options market implies a possible 4.6% move in either direction, with shares having fallen 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these negative indicators and the overall sentiment from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising. However, the strong overall market performance and potential for strong Q4 earnings provide some counterbalance, though not enough to outweigh the negative factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's significant investment in a dividend-paying stock, which is likely to be Apple Inc. (AAPL) given its prominence and dividend-paying status. This association with Buffett, a highly respected investor, could enhance investor confidence and potentially drive the stock price up. However, various analysts have expressed concerns about Apple's slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and overvaluation, which could weigh on the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiments and the influence of Buffett's investment, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate but slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the aforementioned concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarter results. This suggests a negative outlook on the stock in the short term. However, considering the historical performance of the stock and the potential for long-term growth, as well as the mixed sentiment from other analysts and models, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising. The previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives. This demonstrates Apple's commitment to progressive values and inclusivity, which is likely to resonate positively with its stakeholders, particularly investors who value socially responsible investments.
