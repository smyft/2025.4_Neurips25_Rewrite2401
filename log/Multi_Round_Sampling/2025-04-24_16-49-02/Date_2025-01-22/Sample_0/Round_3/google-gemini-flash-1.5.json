(AAPL) the Best Cash App Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nOver the years, its strong Services business segment has grown to include Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allow consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.\n\nBy concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has strengthened its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector. This ecosystem revolves around Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone, which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Giving it pricing power, switching costs, and network effects as a result. Retaining consumers inside this walled garden maximizes the benefits of all other Apple services and products. This approach gives the company room to flourish and sets it apart.\n\nFor the September quarter in Q4 of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. This was driven by strong iPhone revenue of $46.2 billion, which climbed 6% and set a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Over 1 billion paid memberships throughout the firm\u2019s ecosystem contributed to a double-digit increase in services revenue, which hit a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. The Apple Intelligence system, iPhone 16, Mac with M4 chips, new iPads, and improvements for the Apple Watch and AirPods were among the advances the company introduced. Furthermore, Apple broke revenue records in emerging markets, with the September quarter seeing an all-time high in India.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral throughout its whole footprint by 2030 by launching the first-ever carbon-neutral Mac and a carbon-neutral Apple Watch option. These accomplishments highlight the company\u2019s robust innovation, growth, and sustainability leadership.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is currently the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones for 2025, which typically suggests negative sentiment and could lead to further selling pressure. However, the question posed in the headline about whether the sell-off represents a buying opportunity suggests that some investors may see this as a chance to buy at a lower price, potentially stabilizing or increasing the stock price. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the prevailing negative sentiment, but there is still a notable chance of a rise if buying interest increases.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' is vague and lacks specific information about Apple's performance, upcoming events, or market trends. It's essentially clickbait. Without concrete details, it's difficult to assess the potential impact on the stock price. The headline itself doesn't provide any positive or negative signals. Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities close to 50% for both rise and fall, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong performance, including record revenue and growth in key segments like iPhone and Services.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best Cash App stocks' suggests positive sentiment from hedge funds. However, the article also notes that the author's firm believes other AI stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  This suggests a degree of caution, tempering the overall positive sentiment.  While Apple's fundamentals are strong, the comparative analysis within the article introduces uncertainty.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's launch of the Galaxy S25 lineup with a focus on AI features, positioning it as a competitor to Apple's iPhone. Given that Apple recently faced stock downgrades due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales, this competitive pressure from Samsung could further concern investors about Apple's market share and sales performance. However, Apple has its own AI and ecosystem strengths, and market reactions may not be immediate or severe. The probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to competitive concerns, but the rise probability accounts for potential resilience in Apple's brand loyalty and ecosystem.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over the iPhone 16 ban, which was imposed due to Apple's failure to meet local investment thresholds. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes setting up an AirTag factory, and Indonesian officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This development is positive for Apple as it removes a significant market barrier and allows the company to resume iPhone 16 sales in Indonesia. Given this positive news, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise as investors perceive this as a favorable outcome for the company's operations and revenue in Southeast Asia.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. The resolution of this dispute is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it will allow the company to resume sales in the Indonesian market. The fact that the Investment Minister expressed confidence that an agreement will soon be reached and that President Prabowo Subianto has approved the latest proposal suggests that a positive outcome is likely. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a case of iPhone theft and the associated challenges faced by the company's theft protection measures. While the story underscores the prevalence of smartphone theft and the effectiveness of Apple's activation lock, it also brings attention to the inefficiencies in law enforcement responses. This could potentially affect consumer confidence slightly, but given Apple's strong market position and robust security features, the impact on stock price is likely minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is currently the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones for 2025, which typically suggests negative sentiment and could lead to further selling pressure. However, the question posed in the headline about whether the sell-off represents a buying opportunity suggests that some investors may see this as a chance to buy at a lower price, potentially stabilizing or increasing the stock price. Given the prevailing negative sentiment and the mixed signals from the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling, but there is still a notable chance of a rise if buying interest increases.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' is inherently neutral. It doesn't provide any concrete information about Apple's current situation or future prospects. The previous rounds of predictions show a wide range of opinions, influenced by various news snippets. Some models focused on negative aspects like Apple being the worst-performing Dow stock or competition from Samsung, while others highlighted positive developments like resolving the Indonesian dispute. Given the lack of specific information in the headline itself and the conflicting signals from previous rounds, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, as the question implies some uncertainty or potential downside. However, the possibility of a rise remains significant, as the question also suggests a potential buying opportunity.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's presence and performance within the Cash App ecosystem, highlighting its strong position in the mobile payment market and its inclusion among top stocks favored by hedge funds.  While the article mentions Apple's record revenue and growth in key segments, it also acknowledges that other AI stocks are considered to have potentially higher returns.  The positive aspects (high hedge fund interest, strong financial performance, and established market position) are balanced by the comparative analysis suggesting other investment opportunities might be more lucrative in the short term.  The CFPB settlement and money laundering fine for Block (Cash App's parent company) are negative factors, but their direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely indirect and less significant than the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple's financial health and market dominance. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions showing a range of probabilities, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, reflecting the overall strength of Apple's position but acknowledging the potential for market fluctuations based on investor sentiment and comparisons with other tech stocks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's launch of the Galaxy S25 lineup with a strong focus on AI features, which positions it as a direct competitor to Apple's iPhone. Given that Apple recently faced stock downgrades due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales, this competitive pressure from Samsung could further concern investors about Apple's market share and sales performance. However, Apple has its own AI and ecosystem strengths, and market reactions may not be immediate or severe. The probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to competitive concerns, but the rise probability accounts for potential resilience in Apple's brand loyalty and ecosystem.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over the iPhone 16 ban, which was imposed due to Apple's failure to meet local investment thresholds.

Indonesian officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks, which is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and allows the company to resume iPhone 16 sales in Indonesia. This development is likely to be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. However, considering the overall market conditions and potential competitive pressures, there is still some uncertainty. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge some potential for a fall due to market dynamics and competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over the iPhone 16 ban, which was imposed due to Apple's failure to meet local investment thresholds. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes setting up an AirTag factory, and Indonesian officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This development is positive for Apple as it removes a significant market barrier and allows the company to resume iPhone 16 sales in Indonesia. Considering the previous predictions, most models have assigned a higher probability to the stock price rising due to the resolution of the dispute, with some models assigning a probability as high as 0.8. Given the positive news and the trend of others' beliefs, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a case of iPhone theft and the associated challenges faced by Apple's anti-theft measures. While the story highlights the prevalence of smartphone theft and the effectiveness of Apple's activation lock, it also brings attention to the inefficiencies in law enforcement responses. This could potentially affect consumer confidence slightly, but given Apple's strong market position and robust security features, the impact on stock price is likely minimal. Additionally, the previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments with varying probabilities of stock price movement. Considering the mixed signals and the relatively minor direct impact of the news on Apple's core business, the probability of stock price movement is expected to be relatively balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is currently the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones for 2025, which typically suggests negative sentiment and could lead to further selling pressure.

Previous rounds show diverse opinions based on different news snippets, ranging from negative aspects like being the worst-performing Dow stock and competition from Samsung, to positive developments like resolving the Indonesian dispute. The models' predictions vary widely, reflecting the ambiguity of the initial headline. Considering the lack of concrete information and the conflicting signals, I'll slightly lean towards a neutral stance, but with a slight positive bias due to the potential buying opportunity suggested by the headline. The trend in previous rounds seems to be converging towards a more balanced view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's inclusion in a list of top Cash App stocks favored by hedge funds.  While this suggests positive sentiment, the article also highlights the strong performance of Apple's services and iPhone segments, record revenue, and expansion in emerging markets.  However, it tempers this positivity by noting that other AI stocks are considered to have potentially higher returns in the shorter term.  The significant negative news regarding Cash App's parent company, Block, facing substantial fines for fraud and money laundering, is a factor, but its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely indirect and less significant than the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple's financial health and market dominance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the mixed signals in the news and the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock price movements. Considering the overall positive fundamentals of Apple, the strong performance reported, and the positive sentiment from hedge funds, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledge the potential for market fluctuations based on investor sentiment and comparisons with other tech stocks. The previous rounds' predictions show a trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, which I also take into consideration.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's launch of the Galaxy S25 lineup with a strong focus on AI features, which positions it as a direct competitor to Apple's iPhone.
