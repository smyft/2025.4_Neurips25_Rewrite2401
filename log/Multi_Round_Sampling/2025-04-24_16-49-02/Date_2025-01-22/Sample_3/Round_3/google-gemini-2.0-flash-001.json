(AAPL) the Best Cash App Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nOver the years, its strong Services business segment has grown to include Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allow consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.\n\nBy concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has strengthened its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector. This ecosystem revolves around Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone, which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Giving it pricing power, switching costs, and network effects as a result. Retaining consumers inside this walled garden maximizes the benefits of all other Apple services and products. This approach gives the company room to flourish and sets it apart.\n\nFor the September quarter in Q4 of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. This was driven by strong iPhone revenue of $46.2 billion, which climbed 6% and set a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Over 1 billion paid memberships throughout the firm\u2019s ecosystem contributed to a double-digit increase in services revenue, which hit a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. The Apple Intelligence system, iPhone 16, Mac with M4 chips, new iPads, and improvements for the Apple Watch and AirPods were among the advances the company introduced. Furthermore, Apple broke revenue records in emerging markets, with the September quarter seeing an all-time high in India.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral throughout its whole footprint by 2030 by launching the first-ever carbon-neutral Mac and a carbon-neutral Apple Watch option. These accomplishments highlight the company\u2019s robust innovation, growth, and sustainability leadership.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also mentions significant challenges Apple is facing, particularly in the Chinese market, where sales have dropped and competition is increasing. Additionally, Buffett's recent decision to reduce his stake in Apple may raise concerns among investors. Overall, while the loyalty and brand strength are positive factors, the challenges and Buffett's actions suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to brand loyalty but also a notable chance of a price fall due to market challenges and investor sentiment regarding Buffett's stake reduction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. While it highlights Apple's presence in the mobile payment space through Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, and its overall strong financial performance, the article primarily focuses on Cash App (owned by Block) and its challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and fines. Apple is mentioned as a stock held by many hedge funds and its integration with payment services is noted. However, the article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns. The positive aspects of Apple's financial performance and hedge fund interest are counterbalanced by the focus on Cash App's issues and the suggestion of better AI investment opportunities. Therefore, the news is slightly positive but not overwhelmingly so. The article's primary focus is not on Apple's core business but rather its tangential involvement in the mobile payment space, which is dominated by Cash App in the context of the article. The mention of other potentially better AI stocks further dilutes the positive impact on Apple's stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to China. While it highlights the scale of smartphone theft and the existence of a black market for stolen parts, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or its stock price.  The article focuses on the frustration of the victim and the apparent lack of police response, neither of which are directly relevant to Apple's business.  The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong endorsement of Apple's brand loyalty and the iPhone's integral role in users' lives, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges such as declining iPhone sales in China, increased competition, and Berkshire Hathaway's reduction in Apple shares. These factors introduce uncertainty. Buffett's endorsement may bolster confidence, but the sales decline and competitive pressures could weigh on the stock. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a balanced impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had resulted in a ban on the sales of the iPhone 16 series. The ban was due to Apple's non-compliance with Indonesia's local content policies. Apple has increased its investment commitment to $1 billion, which includes plans for a local facility. The resolution of this issue is expected to allow Apple to resume sales of the iPhone 16 series in Indonesia, one of the largest consumer markets in Southeast Asia. This development is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's sales and revenue in the region. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticizes Microsoft's Copilot, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responds with comments about the potential collapse of business applications. Despite the war of words, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI solutions, with 200 deals closed in the third quarter and a total of 2,000 AI-related deals. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI prospects, sending its stock up over 25% since the introduction of Agentforce. However, there are some skeptics, such as Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded his rating to Sell due to concerns about Salesforce's ability to monetize Agentforce. Given the mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the positive adoption trends and bullish sentiment on the Street are likely to outweigh the negative comments from skeptics.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a major competitor, is entering the AR glasses market in collaboration with Google. This could increase competition for Apple, which is also rumored to be developing similar technology. Increased competition might negatively impact Apple's potential market share in this emerging tech area. However, it also signifies growing interest and advancements in the AR space, which could indirectly benefit Apple if the market expands. Overall, the news leans slightly negative for Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong position among hedge funds as a potential 'Cash App stock' due to Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, its robust ecosystem, and record revenue in the September quarter. The increasing number of paid memberships and progress towards carbon neutrality are also positive signals. However, the article primarily focuses on Cash App's challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and fines, which could indirectly cast a shadow on the digital payment sector. Additionally, the article mentions that some AI stocks might offer better returns than AAPL, potentially diverting investor attention. Considering these factors, the positive aspects of Apple's financial performance and hedge fund interest are slightly outweighed by the focus on Cash App's issues and the suggestion of better AI investment opportunities. The previous round predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, indicating uncertainty in the market sentiment. Given the slightly negative tilt of the news and the mixed previous predictions, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to a black market in China.

The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices.  The overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Considering the previous predictions which range from 0.49/0.49 to 0.7/0.3, and given the largely irrelevant nature of this specific news item to Apple's overall financial health, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, indicating uncertainty in the market. This news item does little to shift that uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

Additionally, considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly higher predictions for the stock price to rise, which also supports this estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a major competitor, is entering the AR glasses market in collaboration with Google. This could increase competition for Apple, which is also rumored to be developing similar technology. Increased competition might negatively impact Apple's potential market share in this emerging tech area. However, it also signifies growing interest and advancements in the AR space, which could indirectly benefit Apple if the market expands. The previous predictions show a mix of sentiments, ranging from slightly positive to slightly negative. Considering the competitive pressure and mixed reactions, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

It also mentions the number of hedge funds holding AAPL. However, the article primarily focuses on Cash App's regulatory challenges and suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns. While Apple's financial performance and hedge fund interest are positive, the focus on Cash App's issues and the suggestion of better AI investments temper the positive outlook. Considering the previous round's predictions, which were mixed, and the current news, which presents both positive and negative aspects, I'm slightly decreasing the probability of a price rise. The fact that the article is about Cash App and not directly about Apple's core business is a significant factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to China, highlighting the scale of the black market for stolen electronics. While this illustrates a problem, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or stock price.  Apple's Activation Lock is presented as a positive security feature mitigating the issue. The article's focus on police inaction is irrelevant to Apple's stock.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, from 0.4 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, reflecting market uncertainty. This news is unlikely to significantly shift that uncertainty. Therefore, I predict a near-neutral probability of price movement, slightly favoring a lack of change due to the irrelevance of the news to Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong endorsement of Apple's brand loyalty and the iPhone's integral role in users' lives, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges such as declining iPhone sales in China, increased competition, and Berkshire Hathaway's reduction in Apple shares. These factors introduce uncertainty. Buffett's endorsement may bolster confidence, but the sales decline and competitive pressures could weigh on the stock. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a balanced impact, with a slight edge towards a positive sentiment due to Buffett's strong endorsement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had resulted in a ban on the sales of the iPhone 16 series.

The news introduces additional competition, which could potentially impact Apple negatively. However, the growing interest in AR technology could also indirectly benefit Apple if the market expands.
