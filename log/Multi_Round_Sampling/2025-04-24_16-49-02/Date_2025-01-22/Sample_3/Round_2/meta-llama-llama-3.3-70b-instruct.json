(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's war of words with Microsoft rages on at Davos\nNews Content: DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 The weather may have been teeth-chattering along the promenade in Davos, but that didn't stop Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff from firing off a few new choice words on AI rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\"Everybody knows that Microsoft has disappointed the world with Copilot and I mean, that's just a repackaged ChatGPT. You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(CRM)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also mentions significant challenges Apple is facing, particularly in the Chinese market, where sales have dropped and competition is increasing. Additionally, Buffett's recent decision to reduce his stake in Apple may raise concerns among investors. Overall, while the loyalty and brand strength are positive factors, the challenges and Buffett's actions suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to brand loyalty but also a notable chance of a price fall due to market challenges and investor sentiment regarding Buffett's stake reduction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple. While it highlights Apple's presence in the mobile payment space through Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, and its overall strong financial performance, the article primarily focuses on Cash App (owned by Block) and its challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and fines. Apple is mentioned as a stock held by many hedge funds and its integration with payment services is noted. However, the article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns. The positive aspects of Apple's financial performance and hedge fund interest are counterbalanced by the focus on Cash App's issues and the suggestion of better AI investment opportunities. Therefore, the news is slightly positive but not overwhelmingly so. The article's primary focus is not on Apple's core business but rather its tangential involvement in the mobile payment space, which is dominated by Cash App in the context of the article. The mention of other potentially better AI stocks further dilutes the positive impact on Apple's stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to China. While it highlights the scale of smartphone theft and the existence of a black market for stolen parts, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or its stock price.  The article focuses on the frustration of the victim and the apparent lack of police response, neither of which are directly relevant to Apple's business.  The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong endorsement of Apple's brand loyalty and the iPhone's integral role in users' lives, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges such as declining iPhone sales in China, increased competition, and Berkshire Hathaway's reduction in Apple shares. These factors introduce uncertainty. Buffett's endorsement may bolster confidence, but the sales decline and competitive pressures could weigh on the stock. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a balanced impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had resulted in a ban on the sales of the iPhone 16 series. The ban was due to Apple's non-compliance with Indonesia's local content policies. Apple has increased its investment commitment to $1 billion, which includes plans for a local facility. The resolution of this issue is expected to allow Apple to resume sales of the iPhone 16 series in Indonesia, one of the largest consumer markets in Southeast Asia. This development is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's sales and revenue in the region. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticizes Microsoft's Copilot, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responds with comments about the potential collapse of business applications. Despite the war of words, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI solutions, with 200 deals closed in the third quarter and a total of 2,000 AI-related deals. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI prospects, sending its stock up over 25% since the introduction of Agentforce. However, there are some skeptics, such as Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded his rating to Sell due to concerns about Salesforce's ability to monetize Agentforce. Given the mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the positive adoption trends and bullish sentiment on the Street are likely to outweigh the negative comments from skeptics.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a major competitor, is entering the AR glasses market in collaboration with Google. This could increase competition for Apple, which is also rumored to be developing similar technology. Increased competition might negatively impact Apple's potential market share in this emerging tech area. However, it also signifies growing interest and advancements in the AR space, which could indirectly benefit Apple if the market expands. Overall, the news leans slightly negative for Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong position among hedge funds as a potential 'Cash App stock' due to Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, its robust ecosystem, and record revenue in the September quarter. The increasing number of paid memberships and progress towards carbon neutrality are also positive signals. However, the article primarily focuses on Cash App's challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and fines, which could indirectly cast a shadow on the digital payment sector. Additionally, the article mentions that some AI stocks might offer better returns than AAPL, potentially diverting investor attention. Considering these factors, the positive aspects of Apple's financial performance and hedge fund interest are slightly outweighed by the focus on Cash App's issues and the suggestion of better AI investment opportunities. The previous round predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, indicating uncertainty in the market sentiment. Given the slightly negative tilt of the news and the mixed previous predictions, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to a black market in China.

The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices.  The overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Considering the previous predictions which range from 0.49/0.49 to 0.7/0.3, and given the largely irrelevant nature of this specific news item to Apple's overall financial health, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, indicating uncertainty in the market. This news item does little to shift that uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

Additionally, considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly higher predictions for the stock price to rise, which also supports this estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a major competitor, is entering the AR glasses market in collaboration with Google.
