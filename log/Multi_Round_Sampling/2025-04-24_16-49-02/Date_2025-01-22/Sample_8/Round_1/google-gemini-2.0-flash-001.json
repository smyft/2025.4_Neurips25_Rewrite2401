(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet\nNews Content: Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age \u2014 or risk sinking further into irrelevance.\n\nA series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker\u2019s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%.\n\nIts board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe move laid bare the board\u2019s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel\u2019s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (i.e. operating a foundry).\n\n\u201c I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,\u201d analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSince Gelsinger\u2019s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley.\n\nA Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are \"already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel.\" They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic.\n\nIntel declined to comment on its CEO search.\n\nYahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel\u2019s board might select to take the helm of America\u2019s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer.\n\nThe aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner \u201cdoesn't want the job.\u201d Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner\u2019s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, \"has a shot.\"\n\nThe former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill \u2014 a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader.\n\n\u201c She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,\u201d one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as \u201ca proven general manager and leader.\u201d\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,\u201d Sag told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel\u2019s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo\u2019s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen.\n\nFive of those \u201coutsiders\u201d previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich.\n\nThe Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates.\n\nSources have mixed opinions on whether it should hire an insider who knows the company well.\n\n\"Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations,\" Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate \u201ca lot of shareholders would love to see\u201d fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel\u2019s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel\u2019s foundry strategy \u2014 a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is \u201cwell-respected\u201d and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,\u201d the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance.\n\nYet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization.\n\nOne of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role.\n\nOne of the five former Intel insiders is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and \u201cexecution-oriented.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick.\n\nStacy Smith \u2014 an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade \u2014 was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as \u201ctrusted, respected, well-liked.\u201d\n\nSmith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba\u2019s chip business as its executive chair, which was rebranded as Kioxia in recent years. The completion of Kioxia\u2019s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said.\n\nFormer executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel\u2019s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job.\n\nWall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up \u201cwithin the next couple of months,\u201d writing that \u201cthe company is relatively far along in the process.\u201d Meanwhile, KeyBanc\u2019s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months.\n\n\u201cThe board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,\u201d Vinh said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLast Friday, Intel\u2019s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition before interest cooled off.\n\nIntel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg.\n\nBut until a new CEO can be found, the chips giant is at a standstill. \u201cThe interim CEOs \u2026 will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,\u201d KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. Intel's instability and potential acquisition rumors could create uncertainty in the tech sector, but Apple's fundamentals remain strong. The news does not directly impact Apple's operations or outlook, leading to a neutral effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's CEO search and the company's struggles. The lack of a clear frontrunner and the board's perceived missteps create uncertainty. While potential acquisition rumors and US officials eyeing a merger between GlobalFoundries and Intel could be positive, the overall tone is negative due to the leadership vacuum and strategic challenges. The article highlights internal disagreements and a lack of confidence in current leadership, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term. The potential for a turnaround with a new CEO is there, but the uncertainty outweighs the potential positive catalysts in the immediate future. The news mentions Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO, but it also casts doubt on whether he would take the job. This doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, but it does indirectly suggest that Apple's internal chip development is strong, which could be seen as a slight positive for Apple in the long run. However, the primary focus of the news is on Intel's struggles, not Apple's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the overall positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the technology sector, citing positive technical indicators and the expectation of continued strong performance from Big Tech companies.  While rising bond yields were initially a concern, they have since retreated, easing pressure on tech stocks.  The article specifically highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and mentions that technical analysts are watching for Apple to catch a bid as it nears its 200-day moving average.  The positive sentiment towards the broader tech sector, coupled with the specific mention of Apple and its upcoming earnings, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple. However, the inherent uncertainty of the market and the possibility of negative surprises in earnings reports must be considered. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, a fall is still possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) search for a new CEO and the challenges the company faces, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there is a mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position. If Srouji were to leave Apple for Intel, it could create uncertainty around Apple's chip development, which is a critical component of its product ecosystem. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards AAPL. Conversely, if Srouji remains at Apple, there would be no direct impact. Given the speculative nature of this scenario and the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a negative reaction but remain relatively neutral overall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests a positive outlook for the technology sector, particularly for large-cap tech companies like Apple Inc. The Nasdaq 100 Index has shown significant resilience, trading above its 200-day moving average for an extended period, and technical analysts expect it to hit fresh all-time highs. The article highlights that technology remains in an outstanding position to continue leading the market higher. Additionally, Apple's approach to its 200-DMA could potentially lead to a bid, indicating a possible increase in stock price. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising appears higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticizes Microsoft's Copilot, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responds with comments about the potential collapse of business applications. Despite the war of words, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI bots, with 200 deals closed in the third quarter and a total of 2,000 AI-related deals. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI prospects, sending the stock up over 25% since the introduction of Agentforce. However, there are some skeptics, such as Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded his rating to Sell. Given the positive momentum and strong adoption of Agentforce, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025, suggesting there might be negative market sentiment affecting its performance. The phrase 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' implies a question about whether the current downturn could be seen as a chance to buy the stock at a lower price. This framing can lead investors to reassess their positions, possibly leading to mixed reactions. However, given that it is already performing poorly, there may be a higher likelihood of some positive correction due to bargain hunting.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
