      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025. Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?\nNews Content: Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025. Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. Intel's instability and potential acquisition rumors could create uncertainty in the tech sector, but Apple's fundamentals remain strong. The news does not directly impact Apple's operations or outlook, leading to a neutral effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's CEO search and the company's struggles. The lack of a clear frontrunner and the board's perceived missteps create uncertainty. While potential acquisition rumors and US officials eyeing a merger between GlobalFoundries and Intel could be positive, the overall tone is negative due to the leadership vacuum and strategic challenges. The article highlights internal disagreements and a lack of confidence in current leadership, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term. The potential for a turnaround with a new CEO is there, but the uncertainty outweighs the potential positive catalysts in the immediate future. The news mentions Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO, but it also casts doubt on whether he would take the job. This doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, but it does indirectly suggest that Apple's internal chip development is strong, which could be seen as a slight positive for Apple in the long run. However, the primary focus of the news is on Intel's struggles, not Apple's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the overall positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the technology sector, citing positive technical indicators and the expectation of continued strong performance from Big Tech companies.  While rising bond yields were initially a concern, they have since retreated, easing pressure on tech stocks.  The article specifically highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and mentions that technical analysts are watching for Apple to catch a bid as it nears its 200-day moving average.  The positive sentiment towards the broader tech sector, coupled with the specific mention of Apple and its upcoming earnings, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple. However, the inherent uncertainty of the market and the possibility of negative surprises in earnings reports must be considered. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, a fall is still possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) search for a new CEO and the challenges the company faces, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there is a mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position. If Srouji were to leave Apple for Intel, it could create uncertainty around Apple's chip development, which is a critical component of its product ecosystem. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards AAPL. Conversely, if Srouji remains at Apple, there would be no direct impact. Given the speculative nature of this scenario and the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a negative reaction but remain relatively neutral overall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests a positive outlook for the technology sector, particularly for large-cap tech companies like Apple Inc. The Nasdaq 100 Index has shown significant resilience, trading above its 200-day moving average for an extended period, and technical analysts expect it to hit fresh all-time highs. The article highlights that technology remains in an outstanding position to continue leading the market higher. Additionally, Apple's approach to its 200-DMA could potentially lead to a bid, indicating a possible increase in stock price. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising appears higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticizes Microsoft's Copilot, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responds with comments about the potential collapse of business applications. Despite the war of words, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI bots, with 200 deals closed in the third quarter and a total of 2,000 AI-related deals. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI prospects, sending the stock up over 25% since the introduction of Agentforce. However, there are some skeptics, such as Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded his rating to Sell. Given the positive momentum and strong adoption of Agentforce, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025, suggesting there might be negative market sentiment affecting its performance. The phrase 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' implies a question about whether the current downturn could be seen as a chance to buy the stock at a lower price. This framing can lead investors to reassess their positions, possibly leading to mixed reactions. However, given that it is already performing poorly, there may be a higher likelihood of some positive correction due to bargain hunting.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
