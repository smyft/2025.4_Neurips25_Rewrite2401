(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's war of words with Microsoft rages on at Davos\nNews Content: DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 The weather may have been teeth-chattering along the promenade in Davos, but that didn't stop Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff from firing off a few new choice words on AI rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\"Everybody knows that Microsoft has disappointed the world with Copilot and I mean, that's just a repackaged ChatGPT. You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(CRM)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. Intel's instability and potential acquisition rumors could create uncertainty in the tech sector, but Apple's fundamentals remain strong. The news does not directly impact Apple's operations or outlook, leading to a neutral effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's CEO search and the company's struggles. The lack of a clear frontrunner and the board's perceived missteps create uncertainty. While potential acquisition rumors and US officials eyeing a merger between GlobalFoundries and Intel could be positive, the overall tone is negative due to the leadership vacuum and strategic challenges. The article highlights internal disagreements and a lack of confidence in current leadership, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term. The potential for a turnaround with a new CEO is there, but the uncertainty outweighs the potential positive catalysts in the immediate future. The news mentions Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO, but it also casts doubt on whether he would take the job. This doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, but it does indirectly suggest that Apple's internal chip development is strong, which could be seen as a slight positive for Apple in the long run. However, the primary focus of the news is on Intel's struggles, not Apple's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the overall positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the technology sector, citing positive technical indicators and the expectation of continued strong performance from Big Tech companies.  While rising bond yields were initially a concern, they have since retreated, easing pressure on tech stocks.  The article specifically highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and mentions that technical analysts are watching for Apple to catch a bid as it nears its 200-day moving average.  The positive sentiment towards the broader tech sector, coupled with the specific mention of Apple and its upcoming earnings, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple. However, the inherent uncertainty of the market and the possibility of negative surprises in earnings reports must be considered. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, a fall is still possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) search for a new CEO and the challenges the company faces, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there is a mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position. If Srouji were to leave Apple for Intel, it could create uncertainty around Apple's chip development, which is a critical component of its product ecosystem. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards AAPL. Conversely, if Srouji remains at Apple, there would be no direct impact. Given the speculative nature of this scenario and the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a negative reaction but remain relatively neutral overall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests a positive outlook for the technology sector, particularly for large-cap tech companies like Apple Inc. The Nasdaq 100 Index has shown significant resilience, trading above its 200-day moving average for an extended period, and technical analysts expect it to hit fresh all-time highs. The article highlights that technology remains in an outstanding position to continue leading the market higher. Additionally, Apple's approach to its 200-DMA could potentially lead to a bid, indicating a possible increase in stock price. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising appears higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticizes Microsoft's Copilot, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responds with comments about the potential collapse of business applications. Despite the war of words, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI bots, with 200 deals closed in the third quarter and a total of 2,000 AI-related deals. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI prospects, sending the stock up over 25% since the introduction of Agentforce. However, there are some skeptics, such as Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded his rating to Sell. Given the positive momentum and strong adoption of Agentforce, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025, suggesting there might be negative market sentiment affecting its performance. The phrase 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' implies a question about whether the current downturn could be seen as a chance to buy the stock at a lower price. This framing can lead investors to reassess their positions, possibly leading to mixed reactions. However, given that it is already performing poorly, there may be a higher likelihood of some positive correction due to bargain hunting.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. While the uncertainty surrounding Intel's leadership could create some volatility in the tech sector, Apple's fundamentals remain strong. The mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position introduces a slight risk, as his departure could impact Apple's chip development. However, the overall sentiment towards Apple remains positive due to its strong market position and upcoming earnings report. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are relatively balanced, but with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Apple's resilience in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's CEO search and internal struggles. While this doesn't directly impact Apple, the mention of Apple's internal chip head, Johny Srouji, as a potential candidate for the Intel CEO position introduces a slight negative sentiment. If Srouji were to leave, it could disrupt Apple's chip development. However, the likelihood of this happening is uncertain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. Given the indirect nature of the news and the uncertainty surrounding Srouji's potential departure, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities towards a neutral stance, but with a slight negative bias due to the potential disruption.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the tech sector, with specific mention of Apple's upcoming earnings and its proximity to its 200-day moving average.  Analysts are bullish, expecting the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 to hit new highs. While rising bond yields were a concern, they've retreated, easing pressure on tech.  However, the analysis also acknowledges the inherent market uncertainty and the possibility of negative surprises during earnings season.  Considering the overwhelmingly positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the specific positive signals for Apple, the probability of a price rise is higher.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements.  My prediction incorporates the overall positive market sentiment and the specific positive indicators for Apple, while acknowledging the risk of negative surprises during earnings season.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's CEO search and internal challenges, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there is a mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position. If Srouji were to leave Apple, it could create uncertainty around Apple's chip development, a critical component of its product ecosystem. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards AAPL. Conversely, if Srouji remains, there would be no direct impact. Given the speculative nature of this scenario and the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a negative reaction but remain relatively neutral overall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index and the technology sector, citing strong technical indicators and the expectation of continued performance from Big Tech companies like Apple. The Nasdaq 100 has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, and technical analysts expect it to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter. Apple's upcoming earnings report and its approach to the 200-day moving average are highlighted as positive factors. The overall sentiment suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market, with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticizing Microsoft's Copilot. Despite the war of words, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI bots. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI prospects, sending the stock up over 25% since the introduction of Agentforce. However, there are some skeptics. Since the news does not directly mention or impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), the probabilities should be closer to neutral. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct impact on Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively balanced, but given the overall positive tone in the tech sector and the fact that Apple's stock is often influenced by broader tech trends, there might be a slight inclination towards a positive movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025. The headline 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' suggests that the current poor performance is creating a situation where investors might see it as a buying opportunity. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall. Considering the overall bearish sentiment, combined with the possibility of bargain hunting, it's reasonable to assume that the stock might experience some positive correction. At the same time, the fundamental underperformance needs to be factored in.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
