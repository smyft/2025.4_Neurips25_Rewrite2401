(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. Intel's instability and potential acquisition rumors could create uncertainty in the tech sector, but Apple's fundamentals remain strong. The news does not directly impact Apple's operations or outlook, leading to a neutral effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's CEO search and the company's struggles. The lack of a clear frontrunner and the board's perceived missteps create uncertainty. While potential acquisition rumors and US officials eyeing a merger between GlobalFoundries and Intel could be positive, the overall tone is negative due to the leadership vacuum and strategic challenges. The article highlights internal disagreements and a lack of confidence in current leadership, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term. The potential for a turnaround with a new CEO is there, but the uncertainty outweighs the potential positive catalysts in the immediate future. The news mentions Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO, but it also casts doubt on whether he would take the job. This doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, but it does indirectly suggest that Apple's internal chip development is strong, which could be seen as a slight positive for Apple in the long run. However, the primary focus of the news is on Intel's struggles, not Apple's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the overall positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the technology sector, citing positive technical indicators and the expectation of continued strong performance from Big Tech companies.  While rising bond yields were initially a concern, they have since retreated, easing pressure on tech stocks.  The article specifically highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and mentions that technical analysts are watching for Apple to catch a bid as it nears its 200-day moving average.  The positive sentiment towards the broader tech sector, coupled with the specific mention of Apple and its upcoming earnings, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple. However, the inherent uncertainty of the market and the possibility of negative surprises in earnings reports must be considered. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, a fall is still possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) search for a new CEO and the challenges the company faces, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there is a mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position. If Srouji were to leave Apple for Intel, it could create uncertainty around Apple's chip development, which is a critical component of its product ecosystem. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards AAPL. Conversely, if Srouji remains at Apple, there would be no direct impact. Given the speculative nature of this scenario and the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a negative reaction but remain relatively neutral overall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests a positive outlook for the technology sector, particularly for large-cap tech companies like Apple Inc. The Nasdaq 100 Index has shown significant resilience, trading above its 200-day moving average for an extended period, and technical analysts expect it to hit fresh all-time highs. The article highlights that technology remains in an outstanding position to continue leading the market higher. Additionally, Apple's approach to its 200-DMA could potentially lead to a bid, indicating a possible increase in stock price. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising appears higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticizes Microsoft's Copilot, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responds with comments about the potential collapse of business applications. Despite the war of words, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI bots, with 200 deals closed in the third quarter and a total of 2,000 AI-related deals. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI prospects, sending the stock up over 25% since the introduction of Agentforce. However, there are some skeptics, such as Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded his rating to Sell. Given the positive momentum and strong adoption of Agentforce, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025, suggesting there might be negative market sentiment affecting its performance. The phrase 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' implies a question about whether the current downturn could be seen as a chance to buy the stock at a lower price. This framing can lead investors to reassess their positions, possibly leading to mixed reactions. However, given that it is already performing poorly, there may be a higher likelihood of some positive correction due to bargain hunting.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. While the uncertainty surrounding Intel's leadership could create some volatility in the tech sector, Apple's fundamentals remain strong. The mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position introduces a slight risk, as his departure could impact Apple's chip development. However, the overall sentiment towards Apple remains positive due to its strong market position and upcoming earnings report. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are relatively balanced, but with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Apple's resilience in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's CEO search and internal struggles. While this doesn't directly impact Apple, the mention of Apple's internal chip head, Johny Srouji, as a potential candidate for the Intel CEO position introduces a slight negative sentiment. If Srouji were to leave, it could disrupt Apple's chip development. However, the likelihood of this happening is uncertain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. Given the indirect nature of the news and the uncertainty surrounding Srouji's potential departure, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities towards a neutral stance, but with a slight negative bias due to the potential disruption.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the tech sector, with specific mention of Apple's upcoming earnings and its proximity to its 200-day moving average.  Analysts are bullish, expecting the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 to hit new highs. While rising bond yields were a concern, they've retreated, easing pressure on tech.  However, the analysis also acknowledges the inherent market uncertainty and the possibility of negative surprises during earnings season.  Considering the overwhelmingly positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the specific positive signals for Apple, the probability of a price rise is higher.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements.  My prediction incorporates the overall positive market sentiment and the specific positive indicators for Apple, while acknowledging the risk of negative surprises during earnings season.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's CEO search and internal challenges, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there is a mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position. If Srouji were to leave Apple, it could create uncertainty around Apple's chip development, a critical component of its product ecosystem. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards AAPL. Conversely, if Srouji remains, there would be no direct impact. Given the speculative nature of this scenario and the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a negative reaction but remain relatively neutral overall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index and the technology sector, citing strong technical indicators and the expectation of continued performance from Big Tech companies like Apple.

Despite the war of words, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI bots. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI prospects, sending the stock up over 25% since the introduction of Agentforce. However, there are some skeptics. Since the news does not directly mention or impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), the probabilities should be closer to neutral. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct impact on Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively balanced, but given the overall positive tone in the tech sector and the fact that Apple's stock is often influenced by broader tech trends, there might be a slight inclination towards a positive movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025. The headline 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' suggests that the current poor performance is creating a situation where investors might see it as a buying opportunity. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall. Considering the overall bearish sentiment, combined with the possibility of bargain hunting, it's reasonable to assume that the stock might experience some positive correction. At the same time, the fundamental underperformance needs to be factored in.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
