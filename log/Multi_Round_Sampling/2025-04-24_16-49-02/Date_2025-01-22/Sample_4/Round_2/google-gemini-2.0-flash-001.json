(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a positive development for Apple Inc., as it enhances their retail presence in a vibrant market and aligns with their commitment to sustainability and accessibility. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the overall market conditions and other external factors could still influence stock performance, hence a balanced probability assessment is provided.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by strong performance of technology stocks, including Apple. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross anticipates the rally to continue, supported by positive technical signals. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key event. Technical analysts are watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA, suggesting potential upward momentum. The overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. However, the article also mentions potential risks like the Fed's policy decision and the possibility of pullbacks. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent uncertainties in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple's mention being incidental to Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company.  Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session, and the news doesn't offer any specific positive catalysts for Apple. While the overall market sentiment might be positive due to the AI investment news and strong performances from other tech companies, this is not directly related to Apple's performance.  The probability of a price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a fall or sideways movement is higher, given the recent 3% drop and lack of positive news specific to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which are internal issues specific to Intel. While the article mentions Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role, this is unlikely to have a direct or significant impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is not the focus of the news, and the mention of Srouji is speculative. Therefore, the news is neutral for Apple, with no clear catalyst for a stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, which implies potential for recovery. The negative performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could signal continued investor skepticism. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, the stock price might rise. Given the current negative trend, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but the mention of a potential buying opportunity suggests some potential for a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, the fact that the question is being asked implies there could be some level of anticipation or speculation about the event's potential to positively affect the stock. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive speculation or anticipation leading up to the event, compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a direct competitor in the smartphone market, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in the AR sector, potentially impacting Apple's market share and future revenue streams. However, the news also highlights the ongoing challenges in developing AR glasses, which might signal that the market is still in its early stages and that Apple continues to have time to develop its own product. The market may interpret this news negatively, leading to a potential short-term dip in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a significant positive development for Apple Inc., enhancing its retail presence in a vibrant market and aligning with its sustainability and accessibility commitments. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to positively impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, external market conditions and other factors could still influence stock performance, necessitating a balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by strong performance of technology stocks, including Apple. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross anticipates the rally to continue, supported by positive technical signals. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key event. Technical analysts are watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA, suggesting potential upward momentum. The overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. However, the article also mentions potential risks like the Fed's policy decision and the possibility of pullbacks. Considering these factors, and the previous rounds of predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent uncertainties in the market. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with some leaning bearish. I'm adjusting my prediction slightly more bullish based on the continued positive technical outlook and the proximity to Apple's earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on other companies, with Apple's mention being secondary and negative (Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company and a recent 3% drop).  While positive news about the AI sector and other tech companies (Nvidia, Oracle, Netflix) might create a generally positive market sentiment, there's no direct positive catalyst for Apple in this news. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's short-term prospects.  The lack of specific positive news for Apple, coupled with its recent decline, suggests a higher probability of a continued downward trend or sideways movement in the short term.  However, the overall market positivity could partially offset this negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, with only a passing mention of Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role. This mention is speculative and unlikely to have a direct or significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is neutral for Apple, as it does not provide any clear catalyst for a stock price movement. Given the lack of relevant information about Apple in the news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are both low and balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, suggesting a negative trend. However, it also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, implying potential for recovery. The recent performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could signal continued investor skepticism. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, the stock price might rise. Considering the current negative trend and the mixed implications of the news, there seems to be a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but with significant potential for a rise if investors view it as a buying opportunity.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Considering the varied predictions from other models, some of which indicate a positive outlook due to potential upcoming events or the overall market sentiment, while others point to recent negative trends or lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple, a balanced approach is necessary. The question itself implies some level of anticipation or speculation about the event's potential to positively affect the stock. However, without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. Given the mixed signals from other predictions and the nature of the question, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is estimated, acknowledging the uncertainty and potential for both positive and negative outcomes.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung, a direct competitor in the smartphone market, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in the AR sector, potentially impacting Apple's market share and future revenue streams. However, the news also highlights the ongoing challenges in developing AR glasses, which might signal that the market is still in its early stages and that Apple continues to have time to develop its own product. The market may interpret this news negatively, leading to a potential short-term dip in Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some predicting a rise and others a fall. Considering the competitive pressure and the current state of the AR market, there is a higher perceived risk of a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
