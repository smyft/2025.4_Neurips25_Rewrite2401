(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a positive development for Apple Inc., as it enhances their retail presence in a vibrant market and aligns with their commitment to sustainability and accessibility. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the overall market conditions and other external factors could still influence stock performance, hence a balanced probability assessment is provided.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by strong performance of technology stocks, including Apple. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross anticipates the rally to continue, supported by positive technical signals. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key event. Technical analysts are watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA, suggesting potential upward momentum. The overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. However, the article also mentions potential risks like the Fed's policy decision and the possibility of pullbacks. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent uncertainties in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple's mention being incidental to Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company.  Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session, and the news doesn't offer any specific positive catalysts for Apple. While the overall market sentiment might be positive due to the AI investment news and strong performances from other tech companies, this is not directly related to Apple's performance.  The probability of a price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a fall or sideways movement is higher, given the recent 3% drop and lack of positive news specific to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which are internal issues specific to Intel. While the article mentions Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role, this is unlikely to have a direct or significant impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is not the focus of the news, and the mention of Srouji is speculative. Therefore, the news is neutral for Apple, with no clear catalyst for a stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, which implies potential for recovery. The negative performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could signal continued investor skepticism. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, the stock price might rise. Given the current negative trend, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but the mention of a potential buying opportunity suggests some potential for a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, the fact that the question is being asked implies there could be some level of anticipation or speculation about the event's potential to positively affect the stock. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive speculation or anticipation leading up to the event, compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a direct competitor in the smartphone market, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in the AR sector, potentially impacting Apple's market share and future revenue streams. However, the news also highlights the ongoing challenges in developing AR glasses, which might signal that the market is still in its early stages and that Apple continues to have time to develop its own product. The market may interpret this news negatively, leading to a potential short-term dip in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a significant positive development for Apple Inc., enhancing its retail presence in a vibrant market and aligning with its sustainability and accessibility commitments. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to positively impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, external market conditions and other factors could still influence stock performance, necessitating a balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by strong performance of technology stocks, including Apple. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross anticipates the rally to continue, supported by positive technical signals. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key event. Technical analysts are watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA, suggesting potential upward momentum. The overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. However, the article also mentions potential risks like the Fed's policy decision and the possibility of pullbacks. Considering these factors, and the previous rounds of predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent uncertainties in the market. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with some leaning bearish. I'm adjusting my prediction slightly more bullish based on the continued positive technical outlook and the proximity to Apple's earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on other companies, with Apple's mention being secondary and negative (Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company and a recent 3% drop).  While positive news about the AI sector and other tech companies (Nvidia, Oracle, Netflix) might create a generally positive market sentiment, there's no direct positive catalyst for Apple in this news. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's short-term prospects.  The lack of specific positive news for Apple, coupled with its recent decline, suggests a higher probability of a continued downward trend or sideways movement in the short term.  However, the overall market positivity could partially offset this negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, with only a passing mention of Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role. This mention is speculative and unlikely to have a direct or significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is neutral for Apple, as it does not provide any clear catalyst for a stock price movement. Given the lack of relevant information about Apple in the news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are both low and balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, suggesting a negative trend. However, it also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, implying potential for recovery. The recent performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could signal continued investor skepticism. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, the stock price might rise. Considering the current negative trend and the mixed implications of the news, there seems to be a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but with significant potential for a rise if investors view it as a buying opportunity.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Considering the varied predictions from other models, some of which indicate a positive outlook due to potential upcoming events or the overall market sentiment, while others point to recent negative trends or lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple, a balanced approach is necessary. The question itself implies some level of anticipation or speculation about the event's potential to positively affect the stock. However, without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. Given the mixed signals from other predictions and the nature of the question, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is estimated, acknowledging the uncertainty and potential for both positive and negative outcomes.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung, a direct competitor in the smartphone market, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google.

However, the news also highlights the ongoing challenges in developing AR glasses, which might signal that the market is still in its early stages and that Apple continues to have time to develop its own product. The market may interpret this news negatively, leading to a potential short-term dip in Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some predicting a rise and others a fall. Considering the competitive pressure and the current state of the AR market, there is a higher perceived risk of a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
