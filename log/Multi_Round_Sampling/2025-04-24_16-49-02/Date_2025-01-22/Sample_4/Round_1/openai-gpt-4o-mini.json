A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a positive development for Apple Inc., as it enhances their retail presence in a vibrant market and aligns with their commitment to sustainability and accessibility. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the overall market conditions and other external factors could still influence stock performance, hence a balanced probability assessment is provided.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by strong performance of technology stocks, including Apple. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross anticipates the rally to continue, supported by positive technical signals. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key event. Technical analysts are watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA, suggesting potential upward momentum. The overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. However, the article also mentions potential risks like the Fed's policy decision and the possibility of pullbacks. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent uncertainties in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple's mention being incidental to Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company.  Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session, and the news doesn't offer any specific positive catalysts for Apple. While the overall market sentiment might be positive due to the AI investment news and strong performances from other tech companies, this is not directly related to Apple's performance.  The probability of a price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a fall or sideways movement is higher, given the recent 3% drop and lack of positive news specific to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which are internal issues specific to Intel. While the article mentions Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role, this is unlikely to have a direct or significant impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is not the focus of the news, and the mention of Srouji is speculative. Therefore, the news is neutral for Apple, with no clear catalyst for a stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, which implies potential for recovery. The negative performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could signal continued investor skepticism. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, the stock price might rise. Given the current negative trend, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but the mention of a potential buying opportunity suggests some potential for a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, the fact that the question is being asked implies there could be some level of anticipation or speculation about the event's potential to positively affect the stock. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive speculation or anticipation leading up to the event, compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a direct competitor in the smartphone market, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in the AR sector, potentially impacting Apple's market share and future revenue streams. However, the news also highlights the ongoing challenges in developing AR glasses, which might signal that the market is still in its early stages and that Apple continues to have time to develop its own product. The market may interpret this news negatively, leading to a potential short-term dip in Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
