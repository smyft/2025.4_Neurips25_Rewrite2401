(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet\nNews Content: Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age \u2014 or risk sinking further into irrelevance.\n\nA series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker\u2019s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%.\n\nIts board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe move laid bare the board\u2019s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel\u2019s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (i.e. operating a foundry).\n\n\u201c I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,\u201d analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSince Gelsinger\u2019s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley.\n\nA Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are \"already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel.\" They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic.\n\nIntel declined to comment on its CEO search.\n\nYahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel\u2019s board might select to take the helm of America\u2019s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer.\n\nThe aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner \u201cdoesn't want the job.\u201d Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner\u2019s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, \"has a shot.\"\n\nThe former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill \u2014 a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader.\n\n\u201c She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,\u201d one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as \u201ca proven general manager and leader.\u201d\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,\u201d Sag told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel\u2019s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo\u2019s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen.\n\nFive of those \u201coutsiders\u201d previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich.\n\nThe Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates.\n\nSources have mixed opinions on whether it should hire an insider who knows the company well.\n\n\"Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations,\" Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate \u201ca lot of shareholders would love to see\u201d fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel\u2019s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel\u2019s foundry strategy \u2014 a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is \u201cwell-respected\u201d and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,\u201d the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance.\n\nYet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization.\n\nOne of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role.\n\nOne of the five former Intel insiders is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and \u201cexecution-oriented.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick.\n\nStacy Smith \u2014 an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade \u2014 was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as \u201ctrusted, respected, well-liked.\u201d\n\nSmith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba\u2019s chip business as its executive chair, which was rebranded as Kioxia in recent years. The completion of Kioxia\u2019s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said.\n\nFormer executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel\u2019s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job.\n\nWall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up \u201cwithin the next couple of months,\u201d writing that \u201cthe company is relatively far along in the process.\u201d Meanwhile, KeyBanc\u2019s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months.\n\n\u201cThe board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,\u201d Vinh said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLast Friday, Intel\u2019s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition before interest cooled off.\n\nIntel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg.\n\nBut until a new CEO can be found, the chips giant is at a standstill. \u201cThe interim CEOs \u2026 will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,\u201d KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a positive development for Apple Inc., as it enhances their retail presence in a vibrant market and aligns with their commitment to sustainability and accessibility. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the overall market conditions and other external factors could still influence stock performance, hence a balanced probability assessment is provided.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by strong performance of technology stocks, including Apple. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross anticipates the rally to continue, supported by positive technical signals. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key event. Technical analysts are watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA, suggesting potential upward momentum. The overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. However, the article also mentions potential risks like the Fed's policy decision and the possibility of pullbacks. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent uncertainties in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple's mention being incidental to Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company.  Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session, and the news doesn't offer any specific positive catalysts for Apple. While the overall market sentiment might be positive due to the AI investment news and strong performances from other tech companies, this is not directly related to Apple's performance.  The probability of a price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a fall or sideways movement is higher, given the recent 3% drop and lack of positive news specific to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which are internal issues specific to Intel. While the article mentions Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role, this is unlikely to have a direct or significant impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is not the focus of the news, and the mention of Srouji is speculative. Therefore, the news is neutral for Apple, with no clear catalyst for a stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, which implies potential for recovery. The negative performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could signal continued investor skepticism. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, the stock price might rise. Given the current negative trend, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but the mention of a potential buying opportunity suggests some potential for a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, the fact that the question is being asked implies there could be some level of anticipation or speculation about the event's potential to positively affect the stock. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive speculation or anticipation leading up to the event, compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a direct competitor in the smartphone market, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in the AR sector, potentially impacting Apple's market share and future revenue streams. However, the news also highlights the ongoing challenges in developing AR glasses, which might signal that the market is still in its early stages and that Apple continues to have time to develop its own product. The market may interpret this news negatively, leading to a potential short-term dip in Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
