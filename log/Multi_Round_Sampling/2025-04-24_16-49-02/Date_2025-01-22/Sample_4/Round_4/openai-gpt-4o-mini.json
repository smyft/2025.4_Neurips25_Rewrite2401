A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a positive development for Apple Inc., as it enhances their retail presence in a vibrant market and aligns with their commitment to sustainability and accessibility. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the overall market conditions and other external factors could still influence stock performance, hence a balanced probability assessment is provided.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by strong performance of technology stocks, including Apple. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross anticipates the rally to continue, supported by positive technical signals. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key event. Technical analysts are watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA, suggesting potential upward momentum. The overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. However, the article also mentions potential risks like the Fed's policy decision and the possibility of pullbacks. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent uncertainties in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple's mention being incidental to Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company.  Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session, and the news doesn't offer any specific positive catalysts for Apple. While the overall market sentiment might be positive due to the AI investment news and strong performances from other tech companies, this is not directly related to Apple's performance.  The probability of a price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a fall or sideways movement is higher, given the recent 3% drop and lack of positive news specific to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which are internal issues specific to Intel. While the article mentions Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role, this is unlikely to have a direct or significant impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is not the focus of the news, and the mention of Srouji is speculative. Therefore, the news is neutral for Apple, with no clear catalyst for a stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, which implies potential for recovery. The negative performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could signal continued investor skepticism. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, the stock price might rise. Given the current negative trend, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but the mention of a potential buying opportunity suggests some potential for a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, the fact that the question is being asked implies there could be some level of anticipation or speculation about the event's potential to positively affect the stock. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive speculation or anticipation leading up to the event, compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung, a direct competitor in the smartphone market, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in the AR sector, potentially impacting Apple's market share and future revenue streams. However, the news also highlights the ongoing challenges in developing AR glasses, which might signal that the market is still in its early stages and that Apple continues to have time to develop its own product. The market may interpret this news negatively, leading to a potential short-term dip in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a significant positive development for Apple Inc., enhancing its retail presence in a vibrant market and aligning with its sustainability and accessibility commitments. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to positively impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, external market conditions and other factors could still influence stock performance, necessitating a balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by strong performance of technology stocks, including Apple. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross anticipates the rally to continue, supported by positive technical signals. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated.

The overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. However, the article also mentions potential risks like the Fed's policy decision and the possibility of pullbacks. Considering these factors, and the previous rounds of predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent uncertainties in the market. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with some leaning bearish. I'm adjusting my prediction slightly more bullish based on the continued positive technical outlook and the proximity to Apple's earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on other companies, with Apple's mention being secondary and negative (Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company and a recent 3% drop).  While positive news about the AI sector and other tech companies (Nvidia, Oracle, Netflix) might create a generally positive market sentiment, there's no direct positive catalyst for Apple in this news. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's short-term prospects.  The lack of specific positive news for Apple, coupled with its recent decline, suggests a higher probability of a continued downward trend or sideways movement in the short term.  However, the overall market positivity could partially offset this negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, with only a passing mention of Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role. This mention is speculative and unlikely to have a direct or significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is neutral for Apple, as it does not provide any clear catalyst for a stock price movement. Given the lack of relevant information about Apple in the news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are both low and balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, suggesting a negative trend. However, it also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, implying potential for recovery. The recent performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could signal continued investor skepticism. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, the stock price might rise. Considering the current negative trend and the mixed implications of the news, there seems to be a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but with significant potential for a rise if investors view it as a buying opportunity.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Considering the varied predictions from other models, some of which indicate a positive outlook due to potential upcoming events or the overall market sentiment, while others point to recent negative trends or lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple, a balanced approach is necessary. The question itself implies some level of anticipation or speculation about the event's potential to positively affect the stock. However, without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. Given the mixed signals from other predictions and the nature of the question, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is estimated, acknowledging the uncertainty and potential for both positive and negative outcomes.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung, a direct competitor in the smartphone market, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google.

The market may interpret this news negatively, leading to a potential short-term dip in Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some predicting a rise and others a fall. Considering the competitive pressure and the current state of the AR market, there is a higher perceived risk of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a significant positive development for Apple Inc., enhancing its retail presence in a vibrant market and aligning with its sustainability and accessibility commitments.

Evercore ISI's Rich Ross is optimistic, citing positive technical signals and downplaying concerns about rising bond yields. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and notes that technical analysts are watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA. Kolovos from Macro Risk Advisors sees pullbacks as buying opportunities. Semiconductor stocks are outperforming software, suggesting a rotation back into chipmakers, which benefits tech. While the article mentions the Fed's policy decision and potential pullbacks as risks, the overall sentiment is bullish for tech, which should positively impact Apple. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight adjustment towards a more bullish outlook due to the continued positive technical outlook and the proximity to Apple's earnings report. However, the inherent uncertainties in the market and the potential for negative surprises during earnings season warrant a balanced approach.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies' significant gains, particularly Nvidia's surpassing of Apple's market capitalization.  While the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector due to AI investment might indirectly benefit Apple, the news itself contains no positive catalysts for Apple.  In fact, Apple's recent 3% drop is mentioned.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's short-term prospects.  Considering the lack of specific positive news for Apple, its recent decline, and the overwhelmingly positive news for competitors, the probability of a price rise is low. The probability of a fall or sideways movement is higher, although the general market positivity might partially offset this negative sentiment.  I'm weighting the lack of positive Apple-specific news more heavily than the general market optimism.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, with only a passing mention of Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO role.

(AAPL). Some predictions suggest a positive outlook due to potential upcoming events, overall market sentiment, and the company's retail presence. However, others point to recent negative trends, lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple, and increased competition in the AR sector.

Evercore ISI's analysis points to continued market strength, supported by technical indicators and a rotation back into semiconductor stocks. The article also highlights the upcoming earnings season, with Apple's report being a key event. While rising bond yields and the Fed's policy decisions pose potential risks, the overall sentiment is bullish. The technical analysis provided, particularly the focus on Apple nearing its 200-DMA, suggests potential upward momentum. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight shift towards a more bullish outlook, but the inherent uncertainties of the market and the potential for earnings surprises warrant a balanced approach.
