(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's advancements in AI technology with its new Galaxy S25 series smartphones, which could potentially attract consumers away from Apple. While Apple is also facing challenges in differentiating its products, the focus on AI by competitors like Samsung may create pressure on Apple's market position. However, the overall smartphone market is experiencing incremental improvements, and consumers may not rush to upgrade, which could mitigate immediate impacts on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight inclination towards a potential decline in stock price due to competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple. Resolving the dispute with Indonesia and resuming iPhone 16 sales in that market is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. The $1 billion investment commitment, while a cost, signals Apple's long-term commitment to the region and could unlock future growth opportunities. The fact that the Investment Minister is publicly expressing confidence in a resolution within 1-2 weeks further strengthens the positive outlook. While the article mentions past disagreements, the current tone suggests a high likelihood of a successful outcome. The market reaction on Thursday, with AAPL edging higher, supports this assessment. However, the impact might be limited as Indonesia is not Apple's largest market, and the news is already partially priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the overall positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the technology sector, citing positive technical indicators and the expectation of continued strong performance from Big Tech companies.  While rising bond yields were initially a concern, they have since retreated, easing pressure on tech stocks.  The article specifically highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and mentions that technical analysts are watching for Apple to catch a bid as it nears its 200-day moving average.  The positive sentiment towards the broader tech sector, coupled with the specific mention of Apple and its upcoming earnings, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple. However, the inherent uncertainty of the market and the possibility of negative surprises in earnings reports must be considered. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, a fall is still possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) earnings but does not provide specific details about the earnings report or any analyst predictions. The content focuses more on small caps and hedging strategies using options, with only a passing reference to Apple. Without concrete information about Apple's earnings performance or market sentiment, it is difficult to make a precise prediction. However, given the lack of negative signals and the general bullish tone of the broader market discussion, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain close to neutral due to the lack of specific information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, which implies potential for recovery. The negative performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could trigger more sell-offs. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, it could lead to a stock price rise. Given the current negative trend, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but the potential for a rise exists if the market perceives the current prices as attractive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming iPhone release could mitigate this effect. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a continued bull run for the Nasdaq 100, driven by favorable factors such as reduced concerns over rising bond yields and positive technical signals. The analyst notes that technology stocks, including Apple Inc., are well-positioned to continue leading the market. While there are potential risks such as upcoming earnings reports and Federal Reserve policy decisions, the overall sentiment is positive for technology stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's advancements in AI technology with its new Galaxy S25 series smartphones, which could attract consumers away from Apple. This competitive pressure may negatively impact Apple's market position, especially as both companies face challenges in differentiating their products. While the overall smartphone market is experiencing incremental improvements, the focus on AI by competitors like Samsung could create a cautious outlook for Apple. However, the impact may be mitigated by the fact that consumers are not likely to rush to upgrade their phones. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to competitive pressures, but there remains a chance for stability or slight rise given Apple's strong brand loyalty and upcoming product releases.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is clearly positive for Apple. Resolving the Indonesian ban on iPhone 16 sales removes a potential obstacle to growth in a significant market. The $1 billion investment, while a cost, demonstrates Apple's commitment to the region and signals potential for future expansion. The Investment Minister's confidence in a resolution within 1-2 weeks further strengthens the positive outlook. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the most recent ones lean towards a positive outlook for Apple. Considering all these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is significantly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the overall positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the tech sector, with analysts predicting further gains.  Apple, as a major tech company, is expected to benefit from this positive trend.  While the news doesn't directly address Apple's specific performance, the positive sentiment towards the broader tech market and the mention of Apple's upcoming earnings report contribute to a higher probability of a price rise.  However, the inherent uncertainty of the market and the potential for negative surprises in earnings reports must be considered.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the overall positive market sentiment and the analysts' bullish outlook on the tech sector, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the risk of a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on small caps and hedging strategies using options, with only a passing reference to Apple Inc. (AAPL) earnings. There is no specific information provided about Apple's earnings performance or any analyst predictions, making it difficult to assess the direct impact on Apple's stock price. However, the general tone of the market discussion is neutral to slightly positive, given the broader context of the Nasdaq 100 and technology sector performance. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiments, with some leaning towards a rise due to positive market sentiment and others towards a fall due to competitive pressures or lack of specific positive news. Given the lack of concrete information about Apple in the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise due to the overall positive market environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend.

However, the potential for a rise exists if the market perceives the current prices as attractive. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming iPhone release could mitigate this effect.

While Samsung's focus on AI tools may attract some consumers away from Apple, the overall smartphone market is experiencing incremental improvements, which could mitigate immediate impacts on Apple's stock. Additionally, Apple's strong brand loyalty and upcoming product releases may provide some support. However, the competitive pressure from Samsung's innovations suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall, but there remains a chance for stability or a slight rise given Apple's market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is positive for Apple as it signals the likely resolution of a dispute that was blocking iPhone 16 sales in Indonesia.

This is bullish for Apple, a major tech company.  While the news doesn't directly address Apple's specific performance, the positive sentiment towards the broader tech market and the mention of Apple's upcoming earnings report contribute to a higher probability of a price rise. However, the inherent uncertainty of the market and the potential for negative surprises in earnings reports must be considered.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall.  The overall positive market sentiment and analysts' bullish outlook on the tech sector, combined with the lack of specific negative news about Apple itself, suggest a higher probability of a price rise.  The fact that bond yields, a headwind for tech, have retreated further strengthens this positive outlook. However, the upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard, and a negative surprise could easily shift the probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily discuss small caps and hedging strategies, with only a passing mention of Apple Inc.
