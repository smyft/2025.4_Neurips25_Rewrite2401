(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's advancements in AI technology with its new Galaxy S25 series smartphones, which could potentially attract consumers away from Apple. While Apple is also facing challenges in differentiating its products, the focus on AI by competitors like Samsung may create pressure on Apple's market position. However, the overall smartphone market is experiencing incremental improvements, and consumers may not rush to upgrade, which could mitigate immediate impacts on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight inclination towards a potential decline in stock price due to competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple. Resolving the dispute with Indonesia and resuming iPhone 16 sales in that market is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. The $1 billion investment commitment, while a cost, signals Apple's long-term commitment to the region and could unlock future growth opportunities. The fact that the Investment Minister is publicly expressing confidence in a resolution within 1-2 weeks further strengthens the positive outlook. While the article mentions past disagreements, the current tone suggests a high likelihood of a successful outcome. The market reaction on Thursday, with AAPL edging higher, supports this assessment. However, the impact might be limited as Indonesia is not Apple's largest market, and the news is already partially priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the overall positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the technology sector, citing positive technical indicators and the expectation of continued strong performance from Big Tech companies.  While rising bond yields were initially a concern, they have since retreated, easing pressure on tech stocks.  The article specifically highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and mentions that technical analysts are watching for Apple to catch a bid as it nears its 200-day moving average.  The positive sentiment towards the broader tech sector, coupled with the specific mention of Apple and its upcoming earnings, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple. However, the inherent uncertainty of the market and the possibility of negative surprises in earnings reports must be considered. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, a fall is still possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) earnings but does not provide specific details about the earnings report or any analyst predictions. The content focuses more on small caps and hedging strategies using options, with only a passing reference to Apple. Without concrete information about Apple's earnings performance or market sentiment, it is difficult to make a precise prediction. However, given the lack of negative signals and the general bullish tone of the broader market discussion, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain close to neutral due to the lack of specific information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, which implies potential for recovery. The negative performance trend might increase the likelihood of a further stock price fall as it could trigger more sell-offs. On the other hand, if investors perceive the sell-off as an overreaction or an opportunity to buy at a lower price, it could lead to a stock price rise. Given the current negative trend, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term, but the potential for a rise exists if the market perceives the current prices as attractive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming iPhone release could mitigate this effect. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a continued bull run for the Nasdaq 100, driven by favorable factors such as reduced concerns over rising bond yields and positive technical signals. The analyst notes that technology stocks, including Apple Inc., are well-positioned to continue leading the market. While there are potential risks such as upcoming earnings reports and Federal Reserve policy decisions, the overall sentiment is positive for technology stocks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
