(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also mentions significant challenges Apple is facing, particularly in the Chinese market, where sales have dropped and competition is increasing. Additionally, Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple may raise concerns among investors. Overall, while the loyalty and brand strength are positive factors, the challenges and Buffett's actions suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to brand loyalty but also a notable chance of a price fall due to market challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, it highlights Warren Buffett's long-standing admiration for Apple and the strong brand loyalty associated with iPhones. This positive sentiment could support the stock price. However, the article also points out significant challenges, including a 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway's recent reduction of its Apple stake by 25% raises concerns about Buffett's evolving strategy and potential market downturn anticipation. The negative aspects seem to outweigh the positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall. The Buffett quote is old news and already priced in. The China sales drop and stake reduction are more recent and impactful.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While the company's earnings projections are positive, showing growth in EPS and revenue,  the stock's recent underperformance compared to the market and sector is concerning.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) is neutral, and the high Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest the stock is trading at a premium compared to its industry peers.  The positive aspect is the strong Zacks Industry Rank for the Computer - Micro Computers industry, suggesting sector strength. However, the lack of recent changes in analyst estimates and the relatively small daily gain lagging the market indices weigh against a significant price increase. Considering these factors, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a higher probability of a relatively flat or slightly negative movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially beating Apple to market in this category. While Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year, the immediate competitive pressure from Samsung could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and historical performance in product launches may mitigate some of the negative impact. The probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to the competitive threat, but the overall impact is likely moderate given Apple's broader product ecosystem and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Missing probability_of_stock_price_rise\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Nvidia's market capitalization reaching nearly $3.45tn and Apple's at $3.35tn. This change in market capitalization is largely due to Nvidia's shares rising and Apple's shares falling. The article also mentions various other companies and their stock performances but focuses on the shift between Nvidia and Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower because the news indicates a decline in Apple's shares, while Nvidia's shares are on the rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a strong emphasis on AI features. This could potentially draw attention to competition in the smartphone market, specifically in AI capabilities. However, Apple is known for its innovative features and strong brand loyalty. The news might not immediately affect Apple's stock directly, as Apple's competitive advantage lies in its ecosystem and software rather than just hardware features. However, concerns about iPhone sales due to potential competition could have a minor negative impact on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also points out significant challenges, particularly the 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Additionally, Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple raises concerns about the company's future prospects. While the brand loyalty and Buffett's endorsement are positive factors, the challenges in the Chinese market and the stake reduction suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the recent challenges outweighing the positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag for Apple. On the positive side, it reinforces the strong brand loyalty and customer satisfaction associated with iPhones, as highlighted by Warren Buffett's quote. This suggests a degree of resilience in Apple's customer base. However, the article also points out significant challenges, including declining iPhone sales in China and increased competition. Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway's recent reduction of its Apple stake raises concerns about Buffett's evolving strategy. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a trend of acknowledging both the positive brand loyalty and the negative market challenges. The China sales drop and stake reduction are more recent and impactful than Buffett's long-held admiration. Given these factors, I believe the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positive, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings are positive, showing growth in EPS and revenue, the stock's recent underperformance compared to the market and sector is a concern.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) is neutral. High Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest the stock is overvalued. The positive is the strong Zacks Industry Rank for the Computer - Micro Computers industry. However, the lack of recent changes in analyst estimates and the small daily gain lagging market indices weigh against a significant price increase.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to competitive pressures (Samsung) and concerns about the Chinese market, while others see potential for a rise based on brand loyalty and positive earnings projections. Considering all factors, including the mixed news, the relatively neutral Zacks Rank, valuation concerns, and the divergence in previous predictions, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the cautious sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's upcoming launch of an ultrathin Galaxy S25 Edge, which could pose a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone lineup, especially since Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year. While Apple has strong brand loyalty and a robust ecosystem, the immediate competitive pressure from Samsung might negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a cautious outlook, with a slight bias towards a potential stock price fall due to the competitive dynamics. However, Apple's historical resilience and market position could mitigate some of the negative effects. Overall, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise due to the competitive threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Nvidia's market capitalization reaching nearly $3.45tn and Apple's at $3.35tn. This change is largely due to Nvidia's shares rising and Apple's shares falling. Additionally, there are mentions of various other companies and their stock performances but no direct positive news about Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising seems lower due to the comparative performance and market dynamics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Nvidia's market capitalization reaching nearly $3.45tn and Apple's at $3.35tn.

The article also mentions various other companies and their stock performances but focuses on the shift between Nvidia and Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower because the news indicates a decline in Apple's shares, while Nvidia's shares are on the rise. Additionally, the article does not provide any positive news about Apple that could potentially drive its stock price up. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall rather than rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a strong emphasis on AI features.
