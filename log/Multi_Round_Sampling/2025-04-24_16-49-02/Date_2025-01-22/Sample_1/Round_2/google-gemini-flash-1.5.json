(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Ascends But Remains Behind Market: Some Facts to Note\nNews Content: The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also mentions significant challenges Apple is facing, particularly in the Chinese market, where sales have dropped and competition is increasing. Additionally, Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple may raise concerns among investors. Overall, while the loyalty and brand strength are positive factors, the challenges and Buffett's actions suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to brand loyalty but also a notable chance of a price fall due to market challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, it highlights Warren Buffett's long-standing admiration for Apple and the strong brand loyalty associated with iPhones. This positive sentiment could support the stock price. However, the article also points out significant challenges, including a 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway's recent reduction of its Apple stake by 25% raises concerns about Buffett's evolving strategy and potential market downturn anticipation. The negative aspects seem to outweigh the positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall. The Buffett quote is old news and already priced in. The China sales drop and stake reduction are more recent and impactful.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While the company's earnings projections are positive, showing growth in EPS and revenue,  the stock's recent underperformance compared to the market and sector is concerning.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) is neutral, and the high Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest the stock is trading at a premium compared to its industry peers.  The positive aspect is the strong Zacks Industry Rank for the Computer - Micro Computers industry, suggesting sector strength. However, the lack of recent changes in analyst estimates and the relatively small daily gain lagging the market indices weigh against a significant price increase. Considering these factors, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a higher probability of a relatively flat or slightly negative movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially beating Apple to market in this category. While Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year, the immediate competitive pressure from Samsung could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and historical performance in product launches may mitigate some of the negative impact. The probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to the competitive threat, but the overall impact is likely moderate given Apple's broader product ecosystem and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Missing probability_of_stock_price_rise\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Nvidia's market capitalization reaching nearly $3.45tn and Apple's at $3.35tn. This change in market capitalization is largely due to Nvidia's shares rising and Apple's shares falling. The article also mentions various other companies and their stock performances but focuses on the shift between Nvidia and Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower because the news indicates a decline in Apple's shares, while Nvidia's shares are on the rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a strong emphasis on AI features. This could potentially draw attention to competition in the smartphone market, specifically in AI capabilities. However, Apple is known for its innovative features and strong brand loyalty. The news might not immediately affect Apple's stock directly, as Apple's competitive advantage lies in its ecosystem and software rather than just hardware features. However, concerns about iPhone sales due to potential competition could have a minor negative impact on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also points out significant challenges, particularly the 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Additionally, Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple raises concerns about the company's future prospects. While the brand loyalty and Buffett's endorsement are positive factors, the challenges in the Chinese market and the stake reduction suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the recent challenges outweighing the positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag for Apple. On the positive side, it reinforces the strong brand loyalty and customer satisfaction associated with iPhones, as highlighted by Warren Buffett's quote. This suggests a degree of resilience in Apple's customer base. However, the article also points out significant challenges, including declining iPhone sales in China and increased competition. Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway's recent reduction of its Apple stake raises concerns about Buffett's evolving strategy. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a trend of acknowledging both the positive brand loyalty and the negative market challenges. The China sales drop and stake reduction are more recent and impactful than Buffett's long-held admiration. Given these factors, I believe the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positive, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings are positive, showing growth in EPS and revenue, the stock's recent underperformance compared to the market and sector is a concern.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) is neutral. High Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest the stock is overvalued. The positive is the strong Zacks Industry Rank for the Computer - Micro Computers industry. However, the lack of recent changes in analyst estimates and the small daily gain lagging market indices weigh against a significant price increase.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to competitive pressures (Samsung) and concerns about the Chinese market, while others see potential for a rise based on brand loyalty and positive earnings projections. Considering all factors, including the mixed news, the relatively neutral Zacks Rank, valuation concerns, and the divergence in previous predictions, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the cautious sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's upcoming launch of an ultrathin Galaxy S25 Edge, which could pose a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone lineup, especially since Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year. While Apple has strong brand loyalty and a robust ecosystem, the immediate competitive pressure from Samsung might negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a cautious outlook, with a slight bias towards a potential stock price fall due to the competitive dynamics. However, Apple's historical resilience and market position could mitigate some of the negative effects. Overall, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise due to the competitive threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Nvidia's market capitalization reaching nearly $3.45tn and Apple's at $3.35tn. This change is largely due to Nvidia's shares rising and Apple's shares falling. Additionally, there are mentions of various other companies and their stock performances but no direct positive news about Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising seems lower due to the comparative performance and market dynamics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Nvidia's market capitalization reaching nearly $3.45tn and Apple's at $3.35tn. This change in market capitalization is largely due to Nvidia's shares rising and Apple's shares falling. The article also mentions various other companies and their stock performances but focuses on the shift between Nvidia and Apple. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower because the news indicates a decline in Apple's shares, while Nvidia's shares are on the rise. Additionally, the article does not provide any positive news about Apple that could potentially drive its stock price up. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall rather than rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a strong emphasis on AI features. This could potentially draw attention to competition in the smartphone market, specifically in AI capabilities. However, Apple is known for its innovative features and strong brand loyalty.
