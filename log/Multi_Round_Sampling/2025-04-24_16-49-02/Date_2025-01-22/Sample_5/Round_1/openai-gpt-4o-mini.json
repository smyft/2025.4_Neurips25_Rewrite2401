(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is set to launch an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's anticipated release of a similar product. This could create competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and sales in the premium smartphone segment. While Apple has a strong brand loyalty and a history of successful product launches, the early entry of Samsung into this new category may lead to a negative sentiment among investors, resulting in a higher probability of stock price decline. However, the overall market reaction will depend on consumer reception of both products and Apple's ability to differentiate its offering. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market. While Apple already has a product (Vision Pro), Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR, poses a significant challenge. The article highlights Apple's struggles with content for the Vision Pro, suggesting a potential weakness. Increased competition generally puts downward pressure on stock prices, especially when a competitor has strong backing. However, Apple's established position and brand loyalty provide some buffer. The market's reaction will also depend on the perceived quality and innovation of Samsung's upcoming product. Given the uncertainty and Apple's existing presence, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, and potentially competing with Apple in this market, is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current products or financials, it introduces increased competition in a burgeoning technology sector where Apple has already made a significant investment with its Vision Pro headset. The success of the Vision Pro is heavily reliant on app development and content creation, an area where Apple has faced challenges.  Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR OS, could further intensify this competition and potentially slow down Apple's market penetration in the AR space. However, the impact is likely to be muted because the AR glasses market is still relatively nascent, and Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of no change or a slight fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by positive technical signals and the potential for continued leadership by technology stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Key points supporting a potential rise in AAPL's stock price include: 1) The Nasdaq 100's strong performance and potential to reach new highs, 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which could provide positive momentum, 3) The pullback in Treasury yields, which is generally favorable for tech stocks, and 4) The rotation back into semiconductor stocks, which could indirectly benefit Apple as a tech leader. However, risks include potential volatility around the Fed's policy decision and earnings season, as well as historical patterns where excessive gains above the 200-day moving average have preceded selloffs. Overall, the bullish sentiment and technical indicators outweigh the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the issue of smartphone theft and the black market for stolen electronics, specifically highlighting Apple's iPhone and its security features like Activation Lock. While the article provides insights into the problem of theft and the resilience of the black market, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or product demand. The article is more of a consumer awareness piece and does not contain information that would significantly alter investor perceptions of Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The slight edge towards a potential fall is due to the negative implications of widespread theft, but this is not expected to have a substantial impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially increase competition for Apple in this space. However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the company has already announced its Vision Pro product. The competition from Samsung and Google may put pressure on Apple's stock price, but the company's established brand and loyal customer base could help mitigate this effect. Additionally, the article highlights the challenges related to cost and engineering in creating true AR glasses, which may affect the timing and success of Samsung's entry into this market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement to lift the iPhone 16 sales ban in Indonesia, a significant market in Southeast Asia. This resolution can potentially lead to increased sales in the region, which may positively impact the company's revenue and overall performance. Since the news suggests a positive outcome, it is likely to have a bullish effect on investor sentiment and consequently on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
