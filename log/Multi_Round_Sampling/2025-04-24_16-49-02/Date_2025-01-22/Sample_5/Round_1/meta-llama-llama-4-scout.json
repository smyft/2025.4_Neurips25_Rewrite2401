(AAPL)\nNews Headline: A Mother Tracks Her Son's Stolen iPhone On An 8,000-Mile Trip From NYC To Shenzhen, China \u2013 Here's What Irks Her More Than Losing The Phone\nNews Content: When a mother in New York City realized her son's iPhone was missing, she did what many parents would do \u2013 she immediately opened Apple's Find My app to track the device. What she discovered was both frustrating and fascinating, as the stolen iPhone went on an international adventure highlighting just how organized the black market for stolen electronics has become.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare? Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nFrom NYC to Shenzhen\n\nThe phone's journey began on Oct. 30 in NYC when it was snatched. First, it appeared in an apartment complex in the Bronx, then sat in a Long Island warehouse for a few days. Months later, it resurfaced nearly 8,000 miles away in Shenzhen, China, a well-known city hub for electronics manufacturing and repair.\n\nBy this point, the device was locked and useless to whoever had it, thanks to Apple's Activation Lock \u2013 a feature designed to prevent thieves from resetting and reselling stolen phones. Despite this, the phone's destination made sense. Shenzhen is home to Huaqiangbei, a sprawling electronics market where stolen phones are dismantled for parts or reassembled into \u201cnew\u201d devices.\n\nThe Scale of the Problem\n\nSmartphone theft is a widespread issue in the United States. Allstate estimates that 5% or an estimated 14.7 million phones were stolen in 2023 alone. Since iPhones make up about 50% of the smartphone market in the U.S., this translates to approximately 7.35 million stolen iPhones in a year. The financial damage is immense, not just in the cost of the devices but also in the security risks posed by potential data breaches.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nWhat Frustrated Her Most\n\nOddly enough, losing the iPhone wasn't the most infuriating part of the ordeal. What truly upset the mother was the lack of interest from local authorities. She filed a police report with the NYPD immediately after the theft, but the response was underwhelming. Even when the phone's location was trackable in NYC, nothing was done to investigate.\n\n\"I'm not that mad about losing this one phone,\" she shared, \"but I wish the NYPD had looked into the Long Island warehouse before it left NY. I bet there are a ton of other phones going through this same path.\" Her frustration resonated with others online, as many shared similar stories of police apathy toward stolen phones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs one person said, \u201cAnd I thought only in India police are not interested in stolen phone cases. Well, this has been the same for the entire world. Looks like a nexus to bring the phone to China where tracking is difficult because of the poor treaty.\u201d\n\nAnother tried explaining things further: \u201cPeople don't understand that filing a police report is literally just a report. It's not a request for the police to look into it or a declaration by the police that they will look into it.\u201d\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nHow the Black Market Thrives\n\nShenzhen's Huaqiangbei district has become a hotbed for dismantling stolen devices. While Apple's Activation Lock, part of its Stolen Device Protection measures, makes it nearly impossible to reuse an iPhone, individual components like screens, batteries and chips can still be salvaged and sold.\n\nIn some cases, thieves even scam the original owners into removing the Activation Lock by sending fake messages claiming to be from Apple. Or, as someone said, \u201cHe'll start getting messages from someone claiming that they bought it and need him to remove the activation lock. Don't do it. Block and ignore. Eventually, they'll start threatening him. Again, ignore. They can't do anything.\u201d\n\nOrganized networks route phones from theft hotspots like NYC to international markets, with Shenzhen being one of the biggest destinations.\n\nThese operations are so well-oiled that stolen phones are often shipped in bulk, passing through intermediaries.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMany are using retirement income calculators to check if they\u2019re on pace \u2014 here\u2019s a breakdown on what\u2019s behind this formula.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is set to launch an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's anticipated release of a similar product. This could create competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and sales in the premium smartphone segment. While Apple has a strong brand loyalty and a history of successful product launches, the early entry of Samsung into this new category may lead to a negative sentiment among investors, resulting in a higher probability of stock price decline. However, the overall market reaction will depend on consumer reception of both products and Apple's ability to differentiate its offering. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market. While Apple already has a product (Vision Pro), Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR, poses a significant challenge. The article highlights Apple's struggles with content for the Vision Pro, suggesting a potential weakness. Increased competition generally puts downward pressure on stock prices, especially when a competitor has strong backing. However, Apple's established position and brand loyalty provide some buffer. The market's reaction will also depend on the perceived quality and innovation of Samsung's upcoming product. Given the uncertainty and Apple's existing presence, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, and potentially competing with Apple in this market, is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current products or financials, it introduces increased competition in a burgeoning technology sector where Apple has already made a significant investment with its Vision Pro headset. The success of the Vision Pro is heavily reliant on app development and content creation, an area where Apple has faced challenges.  Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR OS, could further intensify this competition and potentially slow down Apple's market penetration in the AR space. However, the impact is likely to be muted because the AR glasses market is still relatively nascent, and Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of no change or a slight fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by positive technical signals and the potential for continued leadership by technology stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Key points supporting a potential rise in AAPL's stock price include: 1) The Nasdaq 100's strong performance and potential to reach new highs, 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which could provide positive momentum, 3) The pullback in Treasury yields, which is generally favorable for tech stocks, and 4) The rotation back into semiconductor stocks, which could indirectly benefit Apple as a tech leader. However, risks include potential volatility around the Fed's policy decision and earnings season, as well as historical patterns where excessive gains above the 200-day moving average have preceded selloffs. Overall, the bullish sentiment and technical indicators outweigh the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the issue of smartphone theft and the black market for stolen electronics, specifically highlighting Apple's iPhone and its security features like Activation Lock. While the article provides insights into the problem of theft and the resilience of the black market, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or product demand. The article is more of a consumer awareness piece and does not contain information that would significantly alter investor perceptions of Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The slight edge towards a potential fall is due to the negative implications of widespread theft, but this is not expected to have a substantial impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially increase competition for Apple in this space. However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the company has already announced its Vision Pro product. The competition from Samsung and Google may put pressure on Apple's stock price, but the company's established brand and loyal customer base could help mitigate this effect. Additionally, the article highlights the challenges related to cost and engineering in creating true AR glasses, which may affect the timing and success of Samsung's entry into this market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement to lift the iPhone 16 sales ban in Indonesia, a significant market in Southeast Asia. This resolution can potentially lead to increased sales in the region, which may positively impact the company's revenue and overall performance. Since the news suggests a positive outcome, it is likely to have a bullish effect on investor sentiment and consequently on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
