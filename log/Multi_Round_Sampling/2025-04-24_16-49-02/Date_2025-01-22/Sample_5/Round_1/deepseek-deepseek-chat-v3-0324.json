(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is set to launch an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's anticipated release of a similar product. This could create competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and sales in the premium smartphone segment. While Apple has a strong brand loyalty and a history of successful product launches, the early entry of Samsung into this new category may lead to a negative sentiment among investors, resulting in a higher probability of stock price decline. However, the overall market reaction will depend on consumer reception of both products and Apple's ability to differentiate its offering. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market. While Apple already has a product (Vision Pro), Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR, poses a significant challenge. The article highlights Apple's struggles with content for the Vision Pro, suggesting a potential weakness. Increased competition generally puts downward pressure on stock prices, especially when a competitor has strong backing. However, Apple's established position and brand loyalty provide some buffer. The market's reaction will also depend on the perceived quality and innovation of Samsung's upcoming product. Given the uncertainty and Apple's existing presence, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, and potentially competing with Apple in this market, is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current products or financials, it introduces increased competition in a burgeoning technology sector where Apple has already made a significant investment with its Vision Pro headset. The success of the Vision Pro is heavily reliant on app development and content creation, an area where Apple has faced challenges.  Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR OS, could further intensify this competition and potentially slow down Apple's market penetration in the AR space. However, the impact is likely to be muted because the AR glasses market is still relatively nascent, and Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of no change or a slight fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by positive technical signals and the potential for continued leadership by technology stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Key points supporting a potential rise in AAPL's stock price include: 1) The Nasdaq 100's strong performance and potential to reach new highs, 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which could provide positive momentum, 3) The pullback in Treasury yields, which is generally favorable for tech stocks, and 4) The rotation back into semiconductor stocks, which could indirectly benefit Apple as a tech leader. However, risks include potential volatility around the Fed's policy decision and earnings season, as well as historical patterns where excessive gains above the 200-day moving average have preceded selloffs. Overall, the bullish sentiment and technical indicators outweigh the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the issue of smartphone theft and the black market for stolen electronics, specifically highlighting Apple's iPhone and its security features like Activation Lock. While the article provides insights into the problem of theft and the resilience of the black market, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or product demand. The article is more of a consumer awareness piece and does not contain information that would significantly alter investor perceptions of Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The slight edge towards a potential fall is due to the negative implications of widespread theft, but this is not expected to have a substantial impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially increase competition for Apple in this space. However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the company has already announced its Vision Pro product. The competition from Samsung and Google may put pressure on Apple's stock price, but the company's established brand and loyal customer base could help mitigate this effect. Additionally, the article highlights the challenges related to cost and engineering in creating true AR glasses, which may affect the timing and success of Samsung's entry into this market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement to lift the iPhone 16 sales ban in Indonesia, a significant market in Southeast Asia. This resolution can potentially lead to increased sales in the region, which may positively impact the company's revenue and overall performance. Since the news suggests a positive outcome, it is likely to have a bullish effect on investor sentiment and consequently on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
