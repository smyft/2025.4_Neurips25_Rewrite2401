(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is set to launch an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's anticipated release of a similar product. This could create competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and sales in the premium smartphone segment. While Apple has a strong brand loyalty and a history of successful product launches, the early entry of Samsung into this new category may lead to a negative sentiment among investors, resulting in a higher probability of stock price decline. However, the overall market reaction will depend on consumer reception of both products and Apple's ability to differentiate its offering. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market. While Apple already has a product (Vision Pro), Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR, poses a significant challenge. The article highlights Apple's struggles with content for the Vision Pro, suggesting a potential weakness. Increased competition generally puts downward pressure on stock prices, especially when a competitor has strong backing. However, Apple's established position and brand loyalty provide some buffer. The market's reaction will also depend on the perceived quality and innovation of Samsung's upcoming product. Given the uncertainty and Apple's existing presence, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, and potentially competing with Apple in this market, is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current products or financials, it introduces increased competition in a burgeoning technology sector where Apple has already made a significant investment with its Vision Pro headset. The success of the Vision Pro is heavily reliant on app development and content creation, an area where Apple has faced challenges.  Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR OS, could further intensify this competition and potentially slow down Apple's market penetration in the AR space. However, the impact is likely to be muted because the AR glasses market is still relatively nascent, and Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of no change or a slight fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by positive technical signals and the potential for continued leadership by technology stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Key points supporting a potential rise in AAPL's stock price include: 1) The Nasdaq 100's strong performance and potential to reach new highs, 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which could provide positive momentum, 3) The pullback in Treasury yields, which is generally favorable for tech stocks, and 4) The rotation back into semiconductor stocks, which could indirectly benefit Apple as a tech leader. However, risks include potential volatility around the Fed's policy decision and earnings season, as well as historical patterns where excessive gains above the 200-day moving average have preceded selloffs. Overall, the bullish sentiment and technical indicators outweigh the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the issue of smartphone theft and the black market for stolen electronics, specifically highlighting Apple's iPhone and its security features like Activation Lock. While the article provides insights into the problem of theft and the resilience of the black market, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or product demand. The article is more of a consumer awareness piece and does not contain information that would significantly alter investor perceptions of Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The slight edge towards a potential fall is due to the negative implications of widespread theft, but this is not expected to have a substantial impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially increase competition for Apple in this space. However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the company has already announced its Vision Pro product. The competition from Samsung and Google may put pressure on Apple's stock price, but the company's established brand and loyal customer base could help mitigate this effect. Additionally, the article highlights the challenges related to cost and engineering in creating true AR glasses, which may affect the timing and success of Samsung's entry into this market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement to lift the iPhone 16 sales ban in Indonesia, a significant market in Southeast Asia. This resolution can potentially lead to increased sales in the region, which may positively impact the company's revenue and overall performance. Since the news suggests a positive outcome, it is likely to have a bullish effect on investor sentiment and consequently on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Samsung launching the Galaxy S25 Edge ahead of Apple's anticipated ultrathin iPhone model introduces increased competition in the smartphone market. This could negatively impact Apple's market share and investor sentiment, especially given that Samsung is positioning its product as more accessible. While Apple has strong brand loyalty and a history of successful launches, the early entry of a competitor into a promising new category may lead to a higher probability of stock price decline. Considering the previous predictions and the competitive landscape, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung entering in partnership with Google. This is a negative signal for Apple as it already faces challenges with its Vision Pro, particularly regarding content and app development. While Apple has a strong brand, the increased competition could put downward pressure on the stock. However, the AR market is still nascent, and the success of Samsung's product is not guaranteed. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, but the trend seems to be leaning towards a slightly negative impact. Given this, I'll adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of a fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google's collaboration on AR glasses presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While it introduces increased competition in the AR market, the impact is likely to be muted in the short term. Apple's Vision Pro already exists, and the AR glasses market is still nascent.  The success of the Vision Pro hinges on app development and content, an area where Apple has faced challenges. Samsung's entry, backed by Google, could exacerbate these challenges. However, Apple's strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and overall financial health mitigate the risk of a significant negative impact.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news's impact. Considering the relatively early stage of the AR glasses market and Apple's established position, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) is relatively low.  The slight lean towards a price fall reflects the increased competitive pressure, but this is likely to be a gradual effect rather than an immediate, sharp decline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross suggesting the rally could continue despite rising bond yields. Key points supporting a potential rise in Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) stock price include: 1) The Nasdaq 100's strong performance and potential to reach new highs, 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which could provide positive momentum, 3) The pullback in Treasury yields, which is generally favorable for tech stocks, and 4) The rotation back into semiconductor stocks, which could indirectly benefit Apple as a tech leader.

This resolution can potentially lead to increased sales in the region, which may positively impact the company's revenue and overall performance. Since the news suggests a positive outcome, it is likely to have a bullish effect on investor sentiment and consequently on the stock price. The previous predictions were varied, but most indicated a slight to moderate chance of stock price decline, possibly influenced by external factors such as competition and broader market sentiments. Given the specific news about lifting the sales ban, the positive impact on sales and revenue is likely to outweigh these concerns.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Samsung launching the Galaxy S25 Edge ahead of Apple's anticipated ultrathin iPhone model introduces increased competition in the smartphone market.

While the AR market is still nascent, Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR, could put pressure on Apple's market share and investor sentiment. The previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with a slight trend towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the increased competition and the challenges Apple faces in the AR market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base provide some buffer, preventing a drastic fall. Also, some models in the previous rounds seem to be influenced by other news, which is not relevant to the current news. Therefore, I will not consider those models.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google's collaboration on AR glasses presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it introduces increased competition in a nascent market where Apple has already invested significantly with its Vision Pro, the impact is likely to be muted in the short term.  Apple's established brand, diverse product portfolio, and overall financial health mitigate the risk of a significant negative impact. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  The fact that Apple's Vision Pro is already on the market, albeit with challenges in app development and content creation, lessens the immediate threat. Samsung's entry, even with Google's backing, doesn't guarantee market dominance.  The overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will likely play a larger role in AAPL's short-term price movements than this specific news.
