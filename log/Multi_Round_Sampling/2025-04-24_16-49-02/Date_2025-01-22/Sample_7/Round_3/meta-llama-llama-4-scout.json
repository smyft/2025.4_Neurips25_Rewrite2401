(AAPL) the Best Cash App Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nOver the years, its strong Services business segment has grown to include Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allow consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.\n\nBy concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has strengthened its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector. This ecosystem revolves around Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone, which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Giving it pricing power, switching costs, and network effects as a result. Retaining consumers inside this walled garden maximizes the benefits of all other Apple services and products. This approach gives the company room to flourish and sets it apart.\n\nFor the September quarter in Q4 of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. This was driven by strong iPhone revenue of $46.2 billion, which climbed 6% and set a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Over 1 billion paid memberships throughout the firm\u2019s ecosystem contributed to a double-digit increase in services revenue, which hit a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. The Apple Intelligence system, iPhone 16, Mac with M4 chips, new iPads, and improvements for the Apple Watch and AirPods were among the advances the company introduced. Furthermore, Apple broke revenue records in emerging markets, with the September quarter seeing an all-time high in India.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral throughout its whole footprint by 2030 by launching the first-ever carbon-neutral Mac and a carbon-neutral Apple Watch option. These accomplishments highlight the company\u2019s robust innovation, growth, and sustainability leadership.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also mentions significant challenges Apple is facing, particularly in the Chinese market, where sales have dropped and competition is increasing. Additionally, Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple may raise concerns among investors. Overall, while the loyalty and brand strength are positive factors, the challenges and Buffett's actions suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a price rise due to brand loyalty but also acknowledge the potential for a price fall due to market challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new S25 series smartphones and their enhanced AI capabilities. While Samsung's advancements in AI are highlighted, the article also points out that the smartphone market is facing challenges in delivering meaningful differentiation, and that consumers may not be rushing to upgrade solely based on AI features. The expert's comment suggests that while AI is a positive, it might not be a significant catalyst for immediate upgrades. The article also mentions Apple facing similar challenges with AI. Therefore, the news is mildly negative for Apple, as it indicates increased competition in the AI space, but the overall impact is likely limited due to the broader market trends. Given the context, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to China. While it highlights the scale of smartphone theft and the existence of a black market for stolen parts, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or its stock price.  The article focuses on the frustration of the victim and the apparent lack of police response, neither of which are directly relevant to Apple's business.  The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross suggesting that the rally could continue despite rising bond yields. The article mentions positive technical signals for the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, indicating potential for fresh all-time highs in the first quarter. Specifically, it notes that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is being watched by technical analysts as it nears its 200-day moving average, which could signal a buying opportunity. Additionally, the article mentions that semiconductor stocks, which include major tech companies like Apple, are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting trader rotation back into chipmakers. This overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position within it suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. It highlights Apple's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which enable consumers to manage payments from their iPhones. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. Additionally, Apple's progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030 is noted. However, the article also mentions potential concerns, such as the company's reliance on its ecosystem and regulatory challenges faced by Cash App, its payment service. Overall, the article presents a positive view of Apple's prospects, but also acknowledges potential risks. Based on this analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.6 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.4.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming iPhone release could mitigate this effect. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025, suggesting there might be negative market sentiment affecting its performance. The phrase 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' implies a question about whether the current downturn could be seen as a chance to buy the stock at a lower price. This framing can lead investors to reassess their positions, possibly leading to mixed reactions. However, given that it is already performing poorly, there may be a higher likelihood of some positive correction due to bargain hunting.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

While the article acknowledges that the market faces challenges in delivering meaningful differentiation and that consumers may not rush to upgrade solely based on AI, it highlights Samsung's efforts to innovate and entice consumers. The expert's comment suggests that while AI is a positive, it might not be a significant catalyst for immediate upgrades. The article also mentions Apple facing similar challenges with AI. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise due to positive technical signals and Apple's position in the tech sector, while others predicted a fall due to Samsung's competitive edge and Apple's underperformance. Given the increased competition from Samsung's AI advancements and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I believe there is a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to China, highlighting the scale of the problem and the existence of a black market for stolen parts.  While this illustrates the challenges of smartphone theft and the ingenuity of those involved in the black market, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or stock price. The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually a positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices. The mother's frustration with the police response is irrelevant to Apple's business.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely and are based on various unrelated news items, I'm assigning a neutral probability, slightly weighted towards no change, reflecting the insignificance of this specific news to Apple's overall performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross suggesting that the rally could continue despite rising bond yields.

This overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position within it suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the article also mentions potential risks such as rising bond yields and the Fed's policy decisions, which could introduce some volatility. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. It highlights Apple's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which enable consumers to manage payments from their iPhones. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. Additionally, Apple's progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030 is noted. However, potential concerns such as the company's reliance on its ecosystem and regulatory challenges faced by Cash App are also mentioned. Overall, the positive aspects of Apple's business and its position in the market seem to outweigh the potential risks, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming iPhone release could mitigate this effect. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mixed outlook on Apple's stock price movement. Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong brand loyalty and upcoming product releases, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to increased competition from Samsung and challenges in the smartphone market. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for 2025, which suggests negative market sentiment. The headline 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' indicates uncertainty and potential bargain hunting. Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments; some models predict a rise due to various positive factors, while others predict a fall due to market challenges and competition. Considering the current poor performance and the questioning tone of the headline, it leans towards a higher chance of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also mentions significant challenges Apple is facing, particularly in the Chinese market, where sales have dropped and competition is increasing. Additionally, Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple may raise concerns among investors.

Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a price rise due to brand loyalty but also acknowledge the potential for a price fall due to market challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new S25 series with enhanced AI, directly competing with Apple. While the article acknowledges market-wide challenges in smartphone differentiation, it highlights Samsung's 'doubling down' on AI as a key strategy. An industry expert notes that these enhancements might not be enough to trigger immediate upgrades, but the competitive pressure on Apple is evident. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise due to Apple's strengths, while others predict a fall due to competition. Considering Samsung's aggressive AI push and the expert's cautious outlook, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly elevated. However, Apple's brand loyalty and ecosystem strength should not be discounted, preventing a drastic fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news article about a stolen iPhone's journey to Shenzhen is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  While it highlights the scale of smartphone theft and the black market for parts, this is not a new phenomenon and doesn't directly impact Apple's financials.  Apple's Activation Lock is presented as a positive security feature. The mother's frustration with law enforcement is also irrelevant to Apple's stock performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, based on various other news items and analyses.  Given the lack of direct impact from this specific news, and the mixed signals from previous predictions, I assign a near-neutral probability to both price increase and decrease.  The slight lean towards no change reflects the insignificance of this news to Apple's overall market position and financial health.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross suggesting that the rally could continue despite rising bond yields.
