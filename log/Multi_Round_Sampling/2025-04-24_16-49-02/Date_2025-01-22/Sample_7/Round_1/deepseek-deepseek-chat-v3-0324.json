(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also mentions significant challenges Apple is facing, particularly in the Chinese market, where sales have dropped and competition is increasing. Additionally, Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple may raise concerns among investors. Overall, while the loyalty and brand strength are positive factors, the challenges and Buffett's actions suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a price rise due to brand loyalty but also acknowledge the potential for a price fall due to market challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new S25 series smartphones and their enhanced AI capabilities. While Samsung's advancements in AI are highlighted, the article also points out that the smartphone market is facing challenges in delivering meaningful differentiation, and that consumers may not be rushing to upgrade solely based on AI features. The expert's comment suggests that while AI is a positive, it might not be a significant catalyst for immediate upgrades. The article also mentions Apple facing similar challenges with AI. Therefore, the news is mildly negative for Apple, as it indicates increased competition in the AI space, but the overall impact is likely limited due to the broader market trends. Given the context, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to China. While it highlights the scale of smartphone theft and the existence of a black market for stolen parts, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or its stock price.  The article focuses on the frustration of the victim and the apparent lack of police response, neither of which are directly relevant to Apple's business.  The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross suggesting that the rally could continue despite rising bond yields. The article mentions positive technical signals for the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, indicating potential for fresh all-time highs in the first quarter. Specifically, it notes that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is being watched by technical analysts as it nears its 200-day moving average, which could signal a buying opportunity. Additionally, the article mentions that semiconductor stocks, which include major tech companies like Apple, are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting trader rotation back into chipmakers. This overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position within it suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. It highlights Apple's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which enable consumers to manage payments from their iPhones. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. Additionally, Apple's progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030 is noted. However, the article also mentions potential concerns, such as the company's reliance on its ecosystem and regulatory challenges faced by Cash App, its payment service. Overall, the article presents a positive view of Apple's prospects, but also acknowledges potential risks. Based on this analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.6 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.4.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming iPhone release could mitigate this effect. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025, suggesting there might be negative market sentiment affecting its performance. The phrase 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' implies a question about whether the current downturn could be seen as a chance to buy the stock at a lower price. This framing can lead investors to reassess their positions, possibly leading to mixed reactions. However, given that it is already performing poorly, there may be a higher likelihood of some positive correction due to bargain hunting.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
