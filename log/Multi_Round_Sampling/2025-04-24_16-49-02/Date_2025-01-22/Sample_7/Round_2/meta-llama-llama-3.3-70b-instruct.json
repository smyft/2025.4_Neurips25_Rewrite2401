(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it also mentions significant challenges Apple is facing, particularly in the Chinese market, where sales have dropped and competition is increasing. Additionally, Buffett's recent reduction of his stake in Apple may raise concerns among investors. Overall, while the loyalty and brand strength are positive factors, the challenges and Buffett's actions suggest a mixed outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a price rise due to brand loyalty but also acknowledge the potential for a price fall due to market challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new S25 series smartphones and their enhanced AI capabilities. While Samsung's advancements in AI are highlighted, the article also points out that the smartphone market is facing challenges in delivering meaningful differentiation, and that consumers may not be rushing to upgrade solely based on AI features. The expert's comment suggests that while AI is a positive, it might not be a significant catalyst for immediate upgrades. The article also mentions Apple facing similar challenges with AI. Therefore, the news is mildly negative for Apple, as it indicates increased competition in the AI space, but the overall impact is likely limited due to the broader market trends. Given the context, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to China. While it highlights the scale of smartphone theft and the existence of a black market for stolen parts, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or its stock price.  The article focuses on the frustration of the victim and the apparent lack of police response, neither of which are directly relevant to Apple's business.  The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross suggesting that the rally could continue despite rising bond yields. The article mentions positive technical signals for the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, indicating potential for fresh all-time highs in the first quarter. Specifically, it notes that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is being watched by technical analysts as it nears its 200-day moving average, which could signal a buying opportunity. Additionally, the article mentions that semiconductor stocks, which include major tech companies like Apple, are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting trader rotation back into chipmakers. This overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position within it suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. It highlights Apple's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which enable consumers to manage payments from their iPhones. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. Additionally, Apple's progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030 is noted. However, the article also mentions potential concerns, such as the company's reliance on its ecosystem and regulatory challenges faced by Cash App, its payment service. Overall, the article presents a positive view of Apple's prospects, but also acknowledges potential risks. Based on this analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.6 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.4.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming iPhone release could mitigate this effect. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for the year 2025, suggesting there might be negative market sentiment affecting its performance. The phrase 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' implies a question about whether the current downturn could be seen as a chance to buy the stock at a lower price. This framing can lead investors to reassess their positions, possibly leading to mixed reactions. However, given that it is already performing poorly, there may be a higher likelihood of some positive correction due to bargain hunting.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong admiration for Apple and the loyalty of iPhone users, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

While the article acknowledges that the market faces challenges in delivering meaningful differentiation and that consumers may not rush to upgrade solely based on AI, it highlights Samsung's efforts to innovate and entice consumers. The expert's comment suggests that while AI is a positive, it might not be a significant catalyst for immediate upgrades. The article also mentions Apple facing similar challenges with AI. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise due to positive technical signals and Apple's position in the tech sector, while others predicted a fall due to Samsung's competitive edge and Apple's underperformance. Given the increased competition from Samsung's AI advancements and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I believe there is a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article describes a single incident of iPhone theft and its journey to China, highlighting the scale of the problem and the existence of a black market for stolen parts.  While this illustrates the challenges of smartphone theft and the ingenuity of those involved in the black market, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or stock price. The mention of Apple's Activation Lock is actually a positive, showcasing a security feature that protects users and limits the resale value of stolen devices. The mother's frustration with the police response is irrelevant to Apple's business.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely and are based on various unrelated news items, I'm assigning a neutral probability, slightly weighted towards no change, reflecting the insignificance of this specific news to Apple's overall performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross suggesting that the rally could continue despite rising bond yields.

Additionally, semiconductor stocks, which include major tech companies like Apple, are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting trader rotation back into chipmakers. This overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and Apple's position within it suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the article also mentions potential risks such as rising bond yields and the Fed's policy decisions, which could introduce some volatility. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. It highlights Apple's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which enable consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.

However, potential concerns such as the company's reliance on its ecosystem and regulatory challenges faced by Cash App are also mentioned. Overall, the positive aspects of Apple's business and its position in the market seem to outweigh the potential risks, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming iPhone release could mitigate this effect. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mixed outlook on Apple's stock price movement. Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong brand loyalty and upcoming product releases, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to increased competition from Samsung and challenges in the smartphone market. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones index for 2025, which suggests negative market sentiment. The headline 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' indicates uncertainty and potential bargain hunting. Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments; some models predict a rise due to various positive factors, while others predict a fall due to market challenges and competition. Considering the current poor performance and the questioning tone of the headline, it leans towards a higher chance of a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
