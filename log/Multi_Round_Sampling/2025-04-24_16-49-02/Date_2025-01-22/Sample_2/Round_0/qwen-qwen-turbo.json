(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Warren Buffett Once Claimed iPhones Are So Great That No One Would Take $10,000 To Stop Buying Them\nNews Content: Warren Buffett Once Claimed iPhones Are So Great That No One Would Take $10,000 To Stop Buying Them\n\nWarren Buffett, one of the most famous investors ever, has long admired Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and thinks it\u2019s one of the best companies in the world. He once made a bold claim that perfectly illustrates how much people love their iPhones.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, \"If you're an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000, but the only proviso is they'll take away your iPhone and you'll never be able to buy another, you're not going to take it.\" He believes people value their iPhones so much that even $10,000 wouldn't convince them to give them up forever.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. According to Juniper Research, the total value of B2B cross-border payments stored on the blockchain is projected to exceed $4.4 trillion \u2014 Join the first company to bring blockchain payments to Salesforce early with just $100.\n\nApple's Unmatched Loyalty\n\nBuffett says Apple is special because it creates products that people truly enjoy. The iPhone is not just a phone \u2013 it's an experience many users see as part of their daily lives. Even though there are other phones with cool features \u2013 like better cameras, folding screens or advanced AI \u2013 none give the same smooth and simple experience as iPhones.\n\nIt's not just the usability. Owning an iPhone makes people feel connected to a larger community. Giving up an iPhone, as Buffett suggested, means stepping out of a social circle and giving up the ecosystem that so many users find irreplaceable.\n\nOn the other hand, he said, \"If they tell you if you buy another Ford Motor car, they'll give you $10,000 not to do that, you'll take the $10,000 and buy a Chevy instead.\"\n\nSee Also: With 100+ historic trademark victories, this company holds IP for some of the highest-grossing characters in history.

There\u2019s now a limited window for investors to claim shares at just $2/share with $980 minimum\u2014but the clock is ticking.\n\nA Changing Landscape\n\nDespite Apple's stronghold on customer loyalty, the company has faced recent challenges. In 2024, iPhone sales in China dropped by 17%, marking the biggest annual sales drop Apple has seen in the country. It even lost its market leadership to local competitors like Huawei and Vivo. The broader Chinese smartphone market grew 4% during the same period, showing Apple's struggle to keep up with innovative, domestically produced alternatives.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple offered rare discounts on its iPhone 16 models in China to fight back. However, competition from foldable and AI-powered phones made by other brands continues to challenge Apple.\n\nTrending: This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy \u2014 Here\u2019s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding Closes\n\nBuffett's Evolving Strategy\n\nInterestingly, Buffett's actions regarding Apple have raised eyebrows. Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm he leads, recently reduced its Apple stake by 25%, leaving it with 300 million shares. While Apple still accounts for 26% of Berkshire's portfolio, the sale reflects Buffett's commitment to his value investing principles \u2013 he's always looking for quality investments at a fair price.\n\nThis sale helped Berkshire build up $325 billion in cash, the most it's ever had. Some experts think Buffett is preparing for a possible market downturn or making things easier for the next leader of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!
