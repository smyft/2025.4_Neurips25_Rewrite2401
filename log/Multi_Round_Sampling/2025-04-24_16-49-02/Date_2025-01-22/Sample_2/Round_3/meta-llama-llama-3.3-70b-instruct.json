(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Samsung's Galaxy S25 line emphasizes a strong focus on AI features, which could attract consumers and potentially impact Apple's iPhone sales negatively. Given that Apple has already faced downgrades due to concerns over weaker iPhone sales, this new competition from Samsung may further exacerbate those fears. The introduction of advanced AI capabilities in Samsung's smartphones could lead to a shift in consumer preference, particularly if these features are perceived as innovative and useful. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new S25 series smartphones and their enhanced AI capabilities. While Samsung's advancements in AI are highlighted, the article also points out that the smartphone market is facing challenges in delivering meaningful differentiation, and that consumers may not be rushing to upgrade solely based on AI features. The expert's comment suggests that while AI is a positive, it might not be a significant catalyst for immediate upgrades. The article also mentions Apple facing similar challenges with AI. Therefore, the news is mildly negative for Apple, as it indicates increased competition in the AI space, but the overall impact is likely limited due to the broader market trends. Given the context, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding AI capabilities.  While Salesforce's CEO is bullish on their AI offerings (Agentforce), and the company has seen significant stock growth since its launch, the article also highlights skepticism from at least one analyst who believes Salesforce's AI strategy lacks the necessary assets for meaningful monetization.  The news is primarily about Salesforce, not Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal.  Any movement would likely be due to broader market factors or unrelated news, rather than this specific article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple opening a new store in Miami, Apple Miami Worldcenter, highlights the company's continued expansion and commitment to customer experience, environmental sustainability, and accessibility. The store's innovative design and features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and special programming, could enhance brand loyalty and attract more customers, potentially boosting sales. However, the opening of a single retail store is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's overall financial performance, given the company's vast scale. The news is positive but not transformative, so the stock price may see a slight uptick due to improved investor sentiment rather than a substantial change in fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there may be an upcoming event or announcement on January 30 that could potentially impact Apple's stock price. The speculative nature of the headline implies uncertainty but also hints at a possible positive outlook if the event is expected to be favorable. However, without specific details about the event, the probabilities are based on general market behavior around anticipated announcements. Typically, such headlines might suggest a slight bias towards a potential positive move if investors are considering buying ahead of an expected positive announcement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that the Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes Apple Inc., is expected to continue its bull run despite concerns over rising bond yields. The article cites technical analysis from Evercore ISI's Rich Ross, who believes that the index has further to go and that technology stocks, including Apple, will lead the market higher. Additionally, the article notes that the yield on the 10-year Treasury has pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat, which could be a positive sign for the stock market. Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple is nearing its 200-day moving average, which could provide a buying opportunity. Overall, the analysis suggests that the stock price of Apple Inc. is likely to rise due to the positive outlook for the technology sector and the broader market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, emphasizing the strong brand loyalty and perceived value among users. This positive sentiment could potentially attract more investors and customers, supporting a potential rise in stock price. However, there are also challenges mentioned, such as the recent sales drop in China and Berkshire Hathaway's reduction in Apple's stake, which could negatively impact investor confidence and contribute to a decrease in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about Samsung's Galaxy S25 line emphasizes a strong focus on AI features, which could attract consumers and potentially impact Apple's iPhone sales negatively. Given that Apple has already faced downgrades due to concerns over weaker iPhone sales, the introduction of advanced AI capabilities in Samsung's smartphones may further exacerbate those fears. While the article suggests that AI features may not lead to a significant upgrade cycle, the competitive pressure from Samsung is likely to weigh on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's new S25 series and its enhanced AI capabilities, positioning it as a direct competitor to Apple, particularly in the AI space. While the article acknowledges that the smartphone market faces challenges in differentiation and that consumers may not rush to upgrade solely based on AI, it also highlights Samsung's 'doubling down' on AI. This increased competition, especially in a key area like AI, could negatively impact Apple's market share and investor sentiment. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a stock price fall due to similar competitive pressures. Considering the direct competitive threat posed by Samsung's AI advancements, I believe the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on a public spat between Salesforce and Microsoft's CEOs regarding their respective AI offerings.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple. While the AI space is relevant to Apple's future, this specific news item provides no direct information about Apple's performance, prospects, or competitive landscape.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some suggesting a slight negative bias due to unrelated news about Samsung's AI advancements and others indicating a neutral or slightly positive outlook based on broader market trends or other unrelated news. Given the lack of direct relevance, the most likely scenario is minimal impact on Apple's stock price. Any movement would be driven by broader market forces or other news unrelated to this Salesforce/Microsoft dispute.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards neutrality.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple opening a new store in Miami, Apple Miami Worldcenter, highlights the company's continued retail expansion, commitment to environmental sustainability, and enhanced customer experience.

However, the opening of a single retail store is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's overall financial performance, given the company's vast scale. The news is positive but not transformative, so the stock price may see a slight uptick due to improved investor sentiment rather than a substantial change in fundamentals. Considering the previous predictions, which were mixed but leaned slightly positive, the probability of a rise is marginally higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan.30?' suggests that there may be an upcoming event or announcement on January 30 that could potentially impact Apple's stock price. This creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty. Historically, such headlines can lead to a slight bias towards a potential positive move if investors are considering buying ahead of an expected positive announcement. However, the previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments. Some models consider the competitive landscape, especially with Samsung's new AI features, as a potential negative factor. Others focus on technical analysis and market trends that could support a rise in stock price. Given this mixed information and the speculative nature of the headline, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive expectations around the January 30 event.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article suggests that the Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes Apple Inc., is expected to continue its bull run despite concerns over rising bond yields.

Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple is nearing its 200-day moving average, which could provide a buying opportunity. Considering the overall positive outlook for the technology sector and the broader market, as well as the technical analysis provided, it is likely that the stock price of Apple Inc. will rise. The previous predictions from other models also show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with some models citing the positive sentiment and others highlighting the potential for Apple to lead the market higher.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, emphasizing the strong brand loyalty and perceived value among users.

However, there are also challenges mentioned, such as the recent sales drop in China and Berkshire Hathaway's reduction in Apple's stake, which could negatively impact investor confidence and contribute to a decrease in stock price. The overall sentiment seems mixed, but the positive aspects appear to outweigh the negatives.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about Samsung's Galaxy S25 line emphasizes a strong focus on AI features, which could attract consumers and negatively impact Apple's iPhone sales.

However, the article also mentions that the smartphone market faces challenges in differentiation and that consumers may not rush to upgrade solely based on AI. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that this news is slightly negative for Apple. The trend shows a slight increase in the probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect this sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on a dispute between Salesforce and Microsoft regarding their AI offerings. This is largely irrelevant to Apple.  While AI is a relevant sector for Apple's future, this specific news provides no direct information about Apple's performance, prospects, or competitive landscape. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, influenced by other unrelated news (Samsung's AI advancements, Apple store openings, general market trends, and analyst predictions).  Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the impact on its stock price is expected to be minimal. Any movement would likely be due to broader market factors or unrelated news.  Considering the previous predictions and the lack of direct impact from this news, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The slight upward trend in previous predictions might reflect broader market optimism or other positive news not included in this specific article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple opening a new store in Miami, Apple Miami Worldcenter, highlights the company's continued retail expansion, commitment to environmental sustainability, and enhanced customer experience.
