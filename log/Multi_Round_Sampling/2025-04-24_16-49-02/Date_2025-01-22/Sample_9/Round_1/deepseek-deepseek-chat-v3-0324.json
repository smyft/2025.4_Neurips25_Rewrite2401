(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. Intel's instability and potential acquisition rumors could create uncertainty in the semiconductor market, which may benefit Apple as a competitor. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's operations or financials. Therefore, the probabilities of stock price movement for Apple are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to potential market shifts favoring Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). While the stock showed a slight gain in the latest trading session, it underperformed the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. The stock has also significantly underperformed its sector and the S&P 500 over the past month. Upcoming earnings are projected to show growth in EPS and revenue, which is positive. However, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests a neutral outlook. The high Forward P/E ratio and PEG ratio compared to the industry average indicate that the stock might be overvalued. The positive industry rank provides some support. Overall, the positive earnings projections are somewhat offset by the underperformance and valuation concerns, leading to a slightly higher probability of a price fall than rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, and potentially competing with Apple in this market, is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current products or financials, it introduces increased competition in a burgeoning technology sector where Apple has already made a significant investment with its Vision Pro headset. The success of the Vision Pro is heavily reliant on app development and content creation, an area where Apple has faced challenges.  Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR OS, could further intensify this competition and potentially slow down Apple's market penetration in the AR space. However, the impact is likely to be muted because the AR glasses market is still nascent, and Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of no change or a slight fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. While Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year, the immediate competitive pressure from Samsung could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Historically, Apple's stock has been sensitive to competitive threats in its core product lines. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin iPhone might mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple Inc. is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had led to a ban on the sales of the iPhone 16 series. The ban was due to Apple's non-compliance with Indonesia's local content policies. By reportedly increasing its investment in the country to $1 billion and planning a local facility for AirTags, Apple seems to be addressing the concerns. A resolution to this issue would allow Apple to regain access to one of Southeast Asia's largest consumer markets, potentially increasing sales in the region. Given this positive development, it is reasonable to expect a favorable impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a heavy focus on AI features, which could potentially impact Apple's iPhone sales. However, the article also mentions that AI smartphones haven't exactly sparked widespread upgrade cycles, and Apple's stock was recently downgraded due to fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. This suggests that the impact of Samsung's new features on Apple's stock price may be limited. Additionally, the article does not provide any direct comparison between Samsung's new features and Apple's current offerings, which makes it difficult to estimate the exact impact on Apple's stock price. Nevertheless, considering the competitive nature of the smartphone market, it is likely that Samsung's new features could put some pressure on Apple's sales, leading to a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Intel's struggle to find a new CEO and the challenges associated with it, which could have implications for Intel's future direction and performance. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly involved in this news, the primary impact is on Intel (INTC). However, the broader implications for the semiconductor industry could affect Apple's business environment. There is no direct news affecting Apple's stock price movements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
