(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Ascends But Remains Behind Market: Some Facts to Note\nNews Content: The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. Intel's instability and potential acquisition rumors could create uncertainty in the semiconductor market, which may benefit Apple as a competitor. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's operations or financials. Therefore, the probabilities of stock price movement for Apple are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to potential market shifts favoring Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). While the stock showed a slight gain in the latest trading session, it underperformed the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. The stock has also significantly underperformed its sector and the S&P 500 over the past month. Upcoming earnings are projected to show growth in EPS and revenue, which is positive. However, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests a neutral outlook. The high Forward P/E ratio and PEG ratio compared to the industry average indicate that the stock might be overvalued. The positive industry rank provides some support. Overall, the positive earnings projections are somewhat offset by the underperformance and valuation concerns, leading to a slightly higher probability of a price fall than rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, and potentially competing with Apple in this market, is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current products or financials, it introduces increased competition in a burgeoning technology sector where Apple has already made a significant investment with its Vision Pro headset. The success of the Vision Pro is heavily reliant on app development and content creation, an area where Apple has faced challenges.  Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR OS, could further intensify this competition and potentially slow down Apple's market penetration in the AR space. However, the impact is likely to be muted because the AR glasses market is still nascent, and Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of no change or a slight fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. While Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year, the immediate competitive pressure from Samsung could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Historically, Apple's stock has been sensitive to competitive threats in its core product lines. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin iPhone might mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple Inc. is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had led to a ban on the sales of the iPhone 16 series. The ban was due to Apple's non-compliance with Indonesia's local content policies. By reportedly increasing its investment in the country to $1 billion and planning a local facility for AirTags, Apple seems to be addressing the concerns. A resolution to this issue would allow Apple to regain access to one of Southeast Asia's largest consumer markets, potentially increasing sales in the region. Given this positive development, it is reasonable to expect a favorable impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a heavy focus on AI features, which could potentially impact Apple's iPhone sales. However, the article also mentions that AI smartphones haven't exactly sparked widespread upgrade cycles, and Apple's stock was recently downgraded due to fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. This suggests that the impact of Samsung's new features on Apple's stock price may be limited. Additionally, the article does not provide any direct comparison between Samsung's new features and Apple's current offerings, which makes it difficult to estimate the exact impact on Apple's stock price. Nevertheless, considering the competitive nature of the smartphone market, it is likely that Samsung's new features could put some pressure on Apple's sales, leading to a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Intel's struggle to find a new CEO and the challenges associated with it, which could have implications for Intel's future direction and performance. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly involved in this news, the primary impact is on Intel (INTC). However, the broader implications for the semiconductor industry could affect Apple's business environment. There is no direct news affecting Apple's stock price movements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
