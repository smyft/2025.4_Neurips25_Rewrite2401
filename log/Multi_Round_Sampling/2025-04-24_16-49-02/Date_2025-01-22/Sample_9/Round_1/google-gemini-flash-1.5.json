(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's ongoing CEO search and its implications for the company, which may indirectly affect Apple due to their competitive relationship in the semiconductor space. Intel's instability and potential acquisition rumors could create uncertainty in the semiconductor market, which may benefit Apple as a competitor. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's operations or financials. Therefore, the probabilities of stock price movement for Apple are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to potential market shifts favoring Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). While the stock showed a slight gain in the latest trading session, it underperformed the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. The stock has also significantly underperformed its sector and the S&P 500 over the past month. Upcoming earnings are projected to show growth in EPS and revenue, which is positive. However, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests a neutral outlook. The high Forward P/E ratio and PEG ratio compared to the industry average indicate that the stock might be overvalued. The positive industry rank provides some support. Overall, the positive earnings projections are somewhat offset by the underperformance and valuation concerns, leading to a slightly higher probability of a price fall than rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, and potentially competing with Apple in this market, is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current products or financials, it introduces increased competition in a burgeoning technology sector where Apple has already made a significant investment with its Vision Pro headset. The success of the Vision Pro is heavily reliant on app development and content creation, an area where Apple has faced challenges.  Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR OS, could further intensify this competition and potentially slow down Apple's market penetration in the AR space. However, the impact is likely to be muted because the AR glasses market is still nascent, and Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of no change or a slight fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. While Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year, the immediate competitive pressure from Samsung could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Historically, Apple's stock has been sensitive to competitive threats in its core product lines. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin iPhone might mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple Inc. is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had led to a ban on the sales of the iPhone 16 series. The ban was due to Apple's non-compliance with Indonesia's local content policies. By reportedly increasing its investment in the country to $1 billion and planning a local facility for AirTags, Apple seems to be addressing the concerns. A resolution to this issue would allow Apple to regain access to one of Southeast Asia's largest consumer markets, potentially increasing sales in the region. Given this positive development, it is reasonable to expect a favorable impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a heavy focus on AI features, which could potentially impact Apple's iPhone sales. However, the article also mentions that AI smartphones haven't exactly sparked widespread upgrade cycles, and Apple's stock was recently downgraded due to fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. This suggests that the impact of Samsung's new features on Apple's stock price may be limited. Additionally, the article does not provide any direct comparison between Samsung's new features and Apple's current offerings, which makes it difficult to estimate the exact impact on Apple's stock price. Nevertheless, considering the competitive nature of the smartphone market, it is likely that Samsung's new features could put some pressure on Apple's sales, leading to a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Intel's struggle to find a new CEO and the challenges associated with it, which could have implications for Intel's future direction and performance. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly involved in this news, the primary impact is on Intel (INTC). However, the broader implications for the semiconductor industry could affect Apple's business environment. There is no direct news affecting Apple's stock price movements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
