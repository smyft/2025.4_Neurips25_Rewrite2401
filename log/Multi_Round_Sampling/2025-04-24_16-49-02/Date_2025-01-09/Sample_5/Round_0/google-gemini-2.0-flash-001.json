While xAI's Grok app launch is significant, it directly competes with established players like OpenAI and Google. Apple's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected in the short term. The news doesn't directly impact Apple's current revenue streams or product offerings. The impact is more on the general AI landscape, and Apple's response to this competition in the future will be more relevant to its stock price. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise or fall is relatively low, with a slight lean towards a neutral to slightly negative impact due to increased competition in a space Apple may eventually want to dominate.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
