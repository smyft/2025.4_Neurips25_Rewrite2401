Since the article does not contain negative news about Apple's AI endeavors but rather presents a comparison, it may slightly boost investor confidence in Apple's AI capabilities. However, the article does not provide a clear advantage of Apple over Microsoft, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. Given the competitive nature of the comparison and the absence of groundbreaking positive news, the probability of a significant stock price rise is moderate. Conversely, the probability of a stock price fall is low because the article does not introduce any negative factors about Apple's AI prospects.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple vs. Microsoft: Which Is the Better Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy in 2025?\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.20\n}"
