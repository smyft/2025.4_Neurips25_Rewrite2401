This comparison does not inherently contain negative information about Apple. In fact, being mentioned alongside Microsoft, a company known for its strong AI investments, could be seen as positive. However, the article does not provide specific details about Apple's AI advancements or any direct comparison that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. Given that the news is more of a general comparison rather than a specific announcement or revelation about Apple's financials or product lineup, it's likely to have a neutral to slightly positive effect, assuming investors view Apple favorably in the AI space. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than falling, reflecting a cautiously optimistic outlook.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple vs. Microsoft: Which Is the Better Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
