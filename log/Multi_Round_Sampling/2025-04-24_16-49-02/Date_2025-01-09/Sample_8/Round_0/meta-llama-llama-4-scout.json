This comparison does not inherently provide new information about Apple's financial performance, products, or market position. It simply places Apple alongside another major tech company in the AI space. Given that both Apple and Microsoft are well-established players, the neutral comparison is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price negatively. However, being mentioned alongside a competitor in a favorable context could maintain or slightly boost investor confidence. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall impact is expected to be minimal.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple vs. Microsoft: Which Is the Better Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
