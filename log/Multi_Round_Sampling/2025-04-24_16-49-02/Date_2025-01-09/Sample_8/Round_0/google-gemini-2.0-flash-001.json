While the headline itself doesn't explicitly favor one company over the other, the framing suggests that both are considered viable AI stocks. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The article's existence indicates investor interest in Apple's AI capabilities, which could attract investment. However, the comparison with Microsoft introduces uncertainty, as investors might perceive Microsoft as a stronger AI player. The lack of specific details in the provided news content makes a strong prediction difficult.
