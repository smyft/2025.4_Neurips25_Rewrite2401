While xAI's Grok app launch is noteworthy, it directly challenges established players like OpenAI and Google. Apple's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected in the short term. Apple is not directly competing with xAI in the same way that Google or Microsoft are. The news is more relevant to companies heavily invested in generative AI services. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is expected to be neutral to slightly negative, as increased competition in a related field could indirectly impact future growth prospects. The probability of a rise is low, and the probability of a fall is slightly higher, but neither is expected to be drastic.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
