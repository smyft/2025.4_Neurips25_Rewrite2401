      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\nNews Content: The AI startup launched its first stand-alone consumer app, as the company tries to catch up with more established players such as OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race.\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a strong investor interest in Apple Inc. due to its recent 30% gain and anticipation of future growth. This positive sentiment typically correlates with upward stock price movement. Given the historical performance and the current market enthusiasm, the probability of the stock price rising is significantly higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news of xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. While it signals increased competition in the generative AI space, Apple is a large, diversified company with its own AI initiatives. The impact is indirect and likely minimal in the short term. The market's reaction will depend on how Grok is received and whether it poses a significant threat to Apple's future AI plans, which is currently uncertain. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement, either up or down, is relatively low. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a fall, as increased competition is generally viewed negatively, even if the impact is small.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.  The news focuses on a competitor in the AI space, but Apple's business is not directly threatened by xAI's app launch. Apple's core business is in hardware and software, with a growing services segment. While Apple is investing in AI, this specific news is about a competitor's progress in a separate area of the AI market. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction due to this news is low. Any movement would likely be due to other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this particular announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock gained 30% last year, driven by investor optimism about its future growth potential. The content suggests that investors are continuing to invest in AAPL due to expectations of sustained growth. Positive sentiment and momentum from the previous year, combined with anticipation of future growth, are likely to influence the stock price positively. However, without specific details on upcoming products, financials, or market conditions, the probability of a rise is based on general market sentiment and historical performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline compares Apple (AAPL) with Microsoft as artificial intelligence stocks to buy in 2025. This comparison does not inherently contain negative information about Apple. In fact, being mentioned alongside Microsoft, a company known for its strong AI investments, could be seen as positive. However, the article does not provide specific details about Apple's AI advancements or any direct comparison that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. Given that the news is more of a general comparison rather than a specific announcement or report about Apple's performance or products, it's likely to have a neutral to slightly positive effect, assuming investors view Apple favorably in the AI space. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than falling, reflecting a cautiously optimistic outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article compares Apple and Microsoft in terms of their artificial intelligence (AI) investments and potential, which could impact their stock prices. Since the article presents a comparison rather than a direct criticism or negative news about Apple, it's likely to have a neutral to slightly positive effect on Apple's stock price. The mention of AI, a growing and promising technology field, could also generate interest and optimism among investors, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. However, the article does not provide conclusive evidence or a clear advantage of Apple over Microsoft in AI, which might limit the positive impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

However, Apple's core business is not solely reliant on AI, and the impact of Grok's launch may be limited.

Given the mixed signals and the relatively indirect impact of the news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a fall, but not a drastic one.
