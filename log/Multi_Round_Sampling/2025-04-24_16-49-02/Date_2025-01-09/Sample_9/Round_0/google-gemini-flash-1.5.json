The news focuses on a competitor in the AI space, but Apple's business is not directly threatened by xAI's app launch. Apple's core business is in hardware and software, with a growing services segment. While Apple is investing in AI, this specific news is about a competitor's progress in a separate area of the AI market. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction due to this news is low. Any movement would likely be due to other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this particular announcement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.05,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.05\n}\n```\n"
