(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's advancements in AI, positioning it as a significant player in the AI sector. However, it also mentions issues with a new AI feature that has caused user frustration and misinformation, which could negatively impact consumer trust. The overall sentiment is mixed; while Apple is recognized for its AI innovations, the negative press surrounding the AI feature may lead to caution among investors. Given the strong hedge fund interest in AAPL and its ranking as a must-watch AI stock, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than that of a fall, but the recent issues may temper that optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management holding a significant stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company. Furthermore, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its 'Outperform' rating with a price target of $250, and App Store revenue growth exceeded expectations. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue and product revenue also showed growth. However, the article also mentions that Madison Investments is underweight on Apple and believes that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions Asness's concerns about high CAPE ratios in the broader U.S. stock market, which could negatively impact Apple. Considering these factors, the positive signals slightly outweigh the negative ones, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall. However, the article also suggests that other AI stocks may be more promising, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is an opinion piece detailing the author's personal investment portfolio and the rationale behind their holdings.  It mentions Apple as one of their top five holdings, highlighting Apple's continued success despite challenges like slowing iPhone sales, emphasizing the strength of its services segment. The author expresses confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, this is a personal opinion and not a professional financial analysis. The news itself doesn't contain any new information about Apple's financial performance or future plans that would significantly impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement due to this news is considered low.  The slight positive sentiment expressed by the author is not enough to significantly outweigh the inherent market volatility and other factors influencing Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reflects positively on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it highlights the company's resilience and continued success despite challenges such as slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainties. The author, who has held AAPL since 2008, emphasizes the company's strong performance, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent growth. The article also underscores the long-term value of holding AAPL shares, with a significant return of 4,120% since the initial purchase. Given the positive sentiment and reaffirmation of Apple's strong market position and growth prospects, the stock is likely to be viewed favorably by investors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and highlights Apple as one of his favorite stocks. The article mentions Apple's growing customer base, increasing services revenue, and high profit margins, which are all positive factors for the company's future growth. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's significant holdings in Apple and Warren Buffett's statement that Apple is better than any business Berkshire owns suggest a strong vote of confidence in the company. These factors suggest that the stock price of Apple is likely to rise due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative and does not provide concrete information about near-term stock price movements. Predicting stock prices over such a long horizon involves numerous variables including technological advancements, market conditions, competition, and macroeconomic factors. Without specific details on recent performance, future product launches, or changes in leadership and strategy, it's challenging to predict the short-term impact of this headline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
