(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's advancements in AI, positioning it as a significant player in the AI sector. However, it also mentions issues with a new AI feature that has caused user frustration and misinformation, which could negatively impact consumer trust. The overall sentiment is mixed; while Apple is recognized for its AI innovations, the negative press surrounding the AI feature may lead to caution among investors. Given the strong hedge fund interest in AAPL and its ranking as a must-watch AI stock, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than that of a fall, but the recent issues may temper that optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management holding a significant stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company. Furthermore, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its 'Outperform' rating with a price target of $250, and App Store revenue growth exceeded expectations. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue and product revenue also showed growth. However, the article also mentions that Madison Investments is underweight on Apple and believes that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions Asness's concerns about high CAPE ratios in the broader U.S. stock market, which could negatively impact Apple. Considering these factors, the positive signals slightly outweigh the negative ones, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall. However, the article also suggests that other AI stocks may be more promising, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is an opinion piece detailing the author's personal investment portfolio and the rationale behind their holdings.  It mentions Apple as one of their top five holdings, highlighting Apple's continued success despite challenges like slowing iPhone sales, emphasizing the strength of its services segment. The author expresses confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, this is a personal opinion and not a professional financial analysis. The news itself doesn't contain any new information about Apple's financial performance or future plans that would significantly impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement due to this news is considered low.  The slight positive sentiment expressed by the author is not enough to significantly outweigh the inherent market volatility and other factors influencing Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reflects positively on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it highlights the company's resilience and continued success despite challenges such as slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainties. The author, who has held AAPL since 2008, emphasizes the company's strong performance, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent growth. The article also underscores the long-term value of holding AAPL shares, with a significant return of 4,120% since the initial purchase. Given the positive sentiment and reaffirmation of Apple's strong market position and growth prospects, the stock is likely to be viewed favorably by investors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and highlights Apple as one of his favorite stocks. The article mentions Apple's growing customer base, increasing services revenue, and high profit margins, which are all positive factors for the company's future growth. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's significant holdings in Apple and Warren Buffett's statement that Apple is better than any business Berkshire owns suggest a strong vote of confidence in the company. These factors suggest that the stock price of Apple is likely to rise due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative and does not provide concrete information about near-term stock price movements. Predicting stock prices over such a long horizon involves numerous variables including technological advancements, market conditions, competition, and macroeconomic factors. Without specific details on recent performance, future product launches, or changes in leadership and strategy, it's challenging to predict the short-term impact of this headline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's advancements in AI, positioning it as a significant player in the AI sector, which is generally positive for investor sentiment. However, the recent issues with the AI feature causing misinformation and user frustration could temper enthusiasm and lead to caution among investors. The mixed sentiment from hedge fund interest and the mention of other AI stocks being more promising also contribute to a cautious outlook. Overall, while there are positive aspects, the negative press surrounding the AI feature may lead to a more tempered probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple. Cliff Asness, a respected figure in finance, holds a significant stake in Apple through AQR Capital Management. Evercore ISI reaffirmed an 'Outperform' rating with a $250 price target, and App Store revenue growth exceeded expectations. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue and product revenue also showed growth. However, there are some cautionary notes. Madison Investments is underweight on Apple, suggesting other AI stocks may offer better returns. Asness also expressed concerns about high CAPE ratios in the broader U.S. stock market, which could negatively impact Apple. The previous round predictions are mostly positive, with some models giving a high probability of stock price rise. Considering all these factors, I will give a slightly higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news article is a personal account of an investor's portfolio holdings, featuring Apple as one of their top five positions.  While the author expresses confidence in Apple's future, this is subjective opinion and doesn't present new material information impacting Apple's stock price. The article highlights Apple's strengths (services segment, market position) and acknowledges challenges (slowing iPhone sales).  However, no new financial data or significant events are revealed.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 probability of a price rise. Considering the lack of new impactful information and the inherent volatility of the market, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this news alone is considered low.  The slight positive sentiment expressed by the author is insufficient to significantly shift the probabilities from a neutral baseline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is a personal reflection on the author's investment portfolio, highlighting Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of their top holdings. The author emphasizes Apple's resilience, strong performance in its services segment, and long-term growth potential, with a 4,120% return since their initial purchase in 2008. While the article is positive about Apple's prospects, it is largely anecdotal and does not provide new financial data or significant market-moving information. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and others noting the lack of concrete news. Given the overall positive tone but lack of impactful new information, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration, and groundbreaking innovations in iOS and iPhone. It mentions Apple's positive financial growth, generation of nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, and return of over $29 billion to shareholders. The introduction of Apple Intelligence and the new iPhone 116 with improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids are also positive factors. Additionally, Apple's investment of approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion in 2024 alone, indicates its commitment to AI development. However, the article also mentions that some AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns in a shorter timeframe, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors, the positive signals slightly outweigh the negative ones, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong position and growth prospects, with a growing customer base, increasing services revenue, and high profit margins. Warren Buffett's statement that Apple is better than any business Berkshire owns and the company's significant holdings in Apple suggest a strong vote of confidence in the company. Considering the positive sentiment and reaffirmation of Apple's strong market position, the stock is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. Additionally, the article mentions Apple's continued investment in new products and services, which could drive long-term growth. The overall sentiment of the article is positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative and does not provide concrete information about near-term stock price movements. However, considering the aggregated opinions from various models, there seems to be a moderate to strong positive sentiment toward Apple. Models like openai/gpt-4o-mini, google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, and meta-llama/llama-4-scout suggest a higher probability of stock price rising, while deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct express stronger confidence in the stock's upward trajectory. Despite these positives, other models like qwen/qwen-turbo highlight the speculative nature and difficulty in predicting long-term movements. Therefore, I lean towards a balanced but slightly positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's advancements in AI, positioning it as a significant player in the sector, which is generally positive for investor sentiment.

Evercore ISI's reaffirmed 'Outperform' rating and strong App Store revenue growth are positive indicators. However, Madison Investments' underweight position and Asness's concerns about broader market valuations introduce some caution. Previous predictions are mixed but generally lean positive. Considering the positive signals from Asness's position and analyst ratings, balanced by the concerns about market conditions and alternative AI investments, I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The provided news article is a personal account of an investor's portfolio, featuring Apple as a top holding.  While positive about Apple's long-term prospects, it offers no new market-moving information. The author's bullish sentiment is subjective and doesn't outweigh the inherent market volatility and other factors influencing Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting this lack of concrete news.  The slight positive bias in some previous predictions is likely due to Apple's generally strong market position and reputation, rather than anything specific in this news piece.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement directly attributable to this news is considered low, leaning slightly towards a neutral position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is a personal reflection on the author's investment portfolio, with Apple Inc.
