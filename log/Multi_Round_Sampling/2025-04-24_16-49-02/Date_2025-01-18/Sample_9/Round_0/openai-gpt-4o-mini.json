(AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nWith everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.
