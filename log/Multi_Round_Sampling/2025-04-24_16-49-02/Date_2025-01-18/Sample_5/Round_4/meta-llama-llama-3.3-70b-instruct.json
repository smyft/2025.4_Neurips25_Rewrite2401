(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's advancements in AI, positioning it as a significant player in the AI sector. However, it also mentions issues with a new AI feature that has caused user frustration and misinformation, leading to a temporary suspension of the feature. While the overall sentiment around AI stocks is positive, the negative press regarding Apple's AI feature could dampen investor confidence. The presence of hedge fund interest in AAPL is a positive indicator, but the mixed news could lead to uncertainty. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the potential for a decline due to the recent issues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline \"Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?\" is inherently neutral. It doesn't contain any specific positive or negative information about Apple's current performance or future prospects. It simply poses a question, suggesting an analysis or speculation about the company's long-term outlook. Without knowing the content of the article, it's impossible to determine whether the analysis is bullish or bearish. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise, assuming that most analyses of Apple's long-term prospects tend to be cautiously optimistic, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. While it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts (Apple Intelligence, iPhone 116 improvements, significant AI investment), and positive mentions from BlackRock (placing it 6th on their list of important AI stocks),  the article also tempers expectations.  BlackRock's overall commentary suggests investor caution regarding AI spending by tech firms and a diversification away from solely tech investments. JPMorgan's analysis emphasizes the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple, suggesting potential for a 'catch down' scenario if the broader market doesn't see sufficient returns from AI investments. The article itself explicitly states that BlackRock believes other AI stocks hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  Therefore, while the positive aspects of Apple's AI initiatives are noted, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns outweigh the immediate bullish impact of this specific news piece.  The probability of a price rise is thus lower than the probability of a price remaining relatively stable or even experiencing a slight dip, given the broader market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is considered a 'forever hold' stock by Warren Buffett, a highly respected investor. This type of endorsement typically boosts investor confidence and can lead to increased demand for the stock. Given Buffett's reputation and the positive sentiment associated with such an endorsement, the stock is likely to experience upward pressure. However, the news does not provide any fundamental or financial data that would directly impact the stock price, so the effect may be modest and short-term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's past performance, its current business model transition towards services, and the potential for future growth. However, it also mentions that the stock's valuation has gotten richer with a P/E ratio of 38.4, which is relatively high. The article concludes that unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years, estimating a 34% increase in stock price by the start of 2030. This suggests a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term but does not guarantee a significant rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and his confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a quality company with a growing and loyal customer base. The article also mentions Apple's increasing active installed base of devices, expansion of its services business, and high profit margins. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in Apple and Warren Buffett's statement that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year suggest a positive outlook for the company. Based on this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple Inc. will rise due to the positive sentiment and long-term growth potential.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative and does not provide concrete information about near-term stock price movements. Predicting stock prices over such a long horizon involves numerous variables including technological advancements, market conditions, competition, and macroeconomic factors. Without specific details on recent performance, future product launches, or changes in leadership and strategy, it's challenging to predict the short-term impact of this headline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's advancements in AI, positioning it as a significant player in the AI sector, which is generally positive for investor sentiment. However, the article also discusses issues with a new AI feature that has caused user frustration and misinformation, leading to its temporary suspension. This mixed sentiment could create uncertainty among investors. Additionally, while there is strong hedge fund interest in AAPL, the overall market sentiment regarding AI stocks is cautious, with some analysts suggesting that other AI stocks may offer better returns. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of it falling due to the recent negative press and broader market concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is inherently neutral and speculative. It doesn't offer any concrete positive or negative information about Apple's current performance or immediate future. The previous rounds of predictions show a wide range of opinions, from cautiously optimistic to neutral, with some models highlighting Apple's AI efforts and others focusing on valuation concerns and broader market sentiment. The trend doesn't show a clear consensus, making it difficult to lean heavily in either direction. Given the lack of specific information in the headline and the mixed opinions from previous predictions, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to a rise, reflecting the general long-term optimism often associated with Apple, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is positive overall, highlighting Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts, and inclusion in BlackRock's top AI stocks.  However, the article also notes caution from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding overall AI investment and the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks.  JPMorgan's analysis suggests potential for a 'catch down' scenario if broader market AI adoption doesn't meet expectations. While Apple's AI initiatives are promising, the tempered expectations and valuation concerns from prominent investment firms outweigh the purely positive aspects of the news.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning more optimistic and others more cautious. Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty in the market, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for a price fall due to broader market concerns and valuation pressures.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever' suggests a long-term bullish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to Warren Buffett's endorsement, which is generally seen as a positive signal by investors. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models (like meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) assigning a high probability of a rise (0.8) due to Buffett's confidence and Apple's strong fundamentals, while others (like qwen/qwen-turbo) remain neutral due to the speculative nature of long-term predictions. The absence of negative news in the headline and the positive association with Buffett's investment strategy tilt the probabilities slightly towards a rise. However, the lack of specific short-term catalysts or financial data tempers the optimism. Overall, the sentiment is cautiously positive, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's past performance, its current business model transition towards services, and the potential for future growth.

Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, there is a cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the potential for a decline due to valuation concerns and market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and his confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a quality company with a growing and loyal customer base. The article also mentions Apple's increasing active installed base of devices, expansion of its services business, and high profit margins. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in Apple and Warren Buffett's statement that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year suggest a positive outlook for the company. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of cautious optimism about the stock price rising, with some models assigning higher probabilities to a rise due to the positive sentiment and long-term growth potential. However, others have noted the high valuation of the stock and potential market volatility, leading to more neutral predictions. Taking into account the overall positive sentiment and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?' is speculative and does not provide concrete information about near-term stock price movements. The various models provided have different perspectives ranging from cautiously optimistic to more skeptical views. There's a mix of positive sentiment from Warren Buffett's backing and Apple's strong fundamentals, alongside concerns about high valuations and slower returns. Considering the mixed signals and the long-term nature of the prediction, the probabilities lean towards a relatively neutral outlook, with a slight bias towards a moderate rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's advancements in AI, positioning it as a significant player in the AI sector, which generally supports positive investor sentiment.

Previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models highlighting Apple's AI efforts and Buffett's endorsement as positives, while others express concerns about valuation and broader market conditions. The trend seems to be converging towards a slightly positive outlook, but with significant uncertainty. Considering the lack of concrete short-term information in the headline and the mixed opinions from previous predictions, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to a rise, reflecting the general long-term optimism often associated with Apple, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty. The previous round's predictions show a slight increase in optimism compared to round 0, which I will also take into account.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is positive overall, highlighting Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts, and its ranking among BlackRock's top AI stocks.

JPMorgan's analysis suggests a potential 'catch down' scenario if broader market AI adoption doesn't meet expectations.

The previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the market. Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for a price fall due to broader market concerns and valuation pressures.

The average prediction of stock price rising in round 2 is about 0.57, and the average prediction of stock price falling in round 2 is about 0.43.
