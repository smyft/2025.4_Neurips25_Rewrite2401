(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(AAPL), which is a positive signal for investors. Asness is a respected figure in finance, and his endorsement could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL shares. Additionally, the reaffirmation of an 'Outperform' rating by Evercore ISI, along with strong revenue growth in the latest quarter, supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsements and strong financial performance suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and identifies Apple as a key holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. It emphasizes Apple's strong brand loyalty, growing customer base, and successful services business. The article also mentions Apple's revenue growth and potential catalysts like Apple Intelligence. While the article acknowledges that the stock has become expensive, it suggests a dollar-cost averaging approach. Overall, the news is positive for Apple, suggesting long-term growth potential and stability. However, the article is from Motley Fool, which is known for its bullish stance on many stocks, and the 'Double Down' advertisement is a marketing tactic. Therefore, the positive sentiment needs to be tempered. The article is also dated January 13, 2025, so the information is not current. Given the positive, but slightly dated and potentially biased, nature of the news, a slight upward bias is assigned to the probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's continued confidence in Apple, citing its strong growth in services revenue, large and growing customer base, and significant profits.  While the article mentions the stock price being expensive, it suggests dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to mitigate risk.  The positive outlook from a renowned investor like Buffett is generally considered bullish. However, the news is not specific to any immediate catalyst for price movement, and market factors beyond Buffett's opinion can influence the stock price. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, it's not guaranteed.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's top holdings, emphasizing its strong fundamentals, loyal customer base, and growth in services revenue.

Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's continued confidence in Apple, despite recent sales, is a positive signal. These factors suggest a bullish sentiment towards AAPL.

(AAPL) and the endorsement from Cliff Asness suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's positive stance on Apple, emphasizing the company's strong fundamentals, increasing installed base, and potential growth in services and AI. Given Buffett's long-term approach and Apple's strong performance metrics, the overall sentiment is highly positive. However, the stock price might experience minor corrections due to its current valuation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance on Apple Inc.

The 'Double Down' advertisement further reinforces the positive sentiment.

However, I will slightly temper the probability due to the fact that the article is from Motley Fool, which is known for its bullish stance on many stocks, and the 'Double Down' advertisement is a marketing tactic.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article is positive for Apple, highlighting Warren Buffett's continued confidence and long-term investment in the company.

However, the article is from Motley Fool, which has a known bullish bias, and the inclusion of a 'Double Down' advertisement raises concerns about potential marketing influence.  Furthermore, the information is dated January 13, 2025, meaning it's not entirely current. Considering these factors, and the previous predictions which range from 0.6 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise than some previous models, accounting for the potential biases and time sensitivity of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article strongly emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc.
