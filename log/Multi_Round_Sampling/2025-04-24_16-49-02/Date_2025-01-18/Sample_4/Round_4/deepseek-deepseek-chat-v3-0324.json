(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the resilience and growth potential of Apple, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent revenue growth despite challenges in iPhone sales. The article emphasizes the importance of long-term investment and the historical performance of Apple, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. Given the positive sentiment around Apple's ability to innovate and maintain its market position, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple (AAPL) is one of Warren Buffett's 'forever' stocks. This implies a strong endorsement of the company's long-term value and stability. Buffett's reputation as a value investor often leads to increased investor confidence and potential buying pressure. However, the headline is vague and doesn't provide specific details about why Apple is considered a 'forever' stock. The impact is likely to be positive, but not dramatically so, as Apple is already a widely held and analyzed stock. The lack of specific details limits the potential for a significant price surge. Also, the article mentions '2 Warren Buffett Stocks', so the impact is diluted as it is not solely focused on Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's continued confidence in Apple, citing its strong performance, growing customer base, expanding services business, and high profit margins.  While the article mentions the stock price being expensive, it suggests dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to mitigate risk.  The positive outlook on Apple's future growth, driven by factors like AI integration and a robust services sector, outweighs the concern about current valuation.  The mention of past successful investments in Apple by the Motley Fool, while potentially biased, further reinforces a positive sentiment. However, it's crucial to remember that even strong companies can experience short-term price fluctuations due to broader market conditions or unforeseen events. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, a complete absence of the possibility of a fall is unrealistic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's long-term investment strategy and highlights the success of holding stocks like Apple (AAPL) over many years, emphasizing the resilience of Apple's services segment and its continued dominance in the smartphone market. The positive sentiment and strong historical performance of Apple, coupled with the author's conviction in the company's future growth, suggest a favorable outlook for the stock. However, the article does not introduce any new, immediate catalysts that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is low, given the overall positive tone and lack of negative indicators.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the Warren Buffett stocks to hold forever. This implies a strong endorsement from a well-respected investor, which is likely to boost investor confidence. Generally, when a prominent figure like Warren Buffett is associated with a company, it tends to have a positive impact on the stock price due to increased perceived value and trust. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and his confidence in Apple Inc.

Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in Apple and Warren Buffett's statement that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year suggest a positive outlook for the company. Based on this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the positive sentiment and confidence expressed by Warren Buffett and the growth prospects of the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's positive stance on Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals, increasing user base, and expanding services. Buffett's endorsement and his belief in holding the stock forever adds significant credibility.

While the article mentions Apple's high valuation, it frames this as a manageable risk through dollar-cost averaging. The emphasis on Apple's growing services revenue, expanding user base, and strategic AI investments reinforces a positive outlook.  However, the article is not solely focused on Apple, sharing the spotlight with Amazon, and the positive sentiment is not a new revelation.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.6 to 0.8 for the probability of a price rise, and the inherent uncertainty in the stock market, a conservative estimate is warranted. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a price rise, but not a dramatic one.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc.

This endorsement from a respected investor like Buffett generally boosts investor confidence and suggests a positive outlook for the company's future performance. The historical success of Apple, its growing services segment, and strong customer loyalty are key factors that contribute to the positive sentiment. While there are no specific new catalysts mentioned, the overall positive tone and Buffett's reputation as a value investor suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.

The overall sentiment of the article is positive, with multiple models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering the positive sentiment and confidence expressed by Warren Buffett, the growth prospects of the company, and the lack of negative indicators, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Warren Buffett's long-standing investment in Apple is well-known. The previous rounds of predictions show a generally positive sentiment, with most models predicting a rise in stock price. However, the range of predictions suggests some uncertainty. Considering the lack of new, specific catalysts and the existing positive sentiment already priced into the stock, I will slightly temper the probability of a rise compared to the previous round's average. Also, the qwen model failed to give a prediction in the previous round, which may indicate some uncertainty about the stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article is positive towards Apple, reiterating Warren Buffett's long-term bullish stance. This endorsement from a highly respected investor is a significant positive factor.  The article highlights Apple's strong fundamentals, including a growing services business, high profit margins, and a large and loyal customer base.  The mention of Apple Intelligence as a potential growth catalyst further strengthens the positive outlook. However, the article is not solely focused on Apple, and the stock's high valuation is acknowledged.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a consensus leaning towards a price rise (ranging from 0.6 to 0.85 probability of a rise), and the inherent uncertainty in the stock market, I've adjusted the probability slightly downward to account for market volatility and the fact that the news is not a major unexpected event.

Considering the existing positive sentiment and the lack of major new catalysts, I will slightly adjust the probability of a rise compared to the previous round's average. Also, the fact that the article mentions '2 Warren Buffett Stocks' dilutes the impact on Apple specifically. Therefore, I will predict a slightly lower probability of stock price rising than the average of the previous round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article is positive but lacks significant new information.  Warren Buffett's long-term holding in Apple is already widely known and factored into the stock price. The article reiterates Apple's strengths: strong fundamentals, growing services revenue, high profit margins, and a large customer base.  However, the article also acknowledges the stock's high valuation.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.85 across multiple models and rounds.  Considering the lack of truly novel information and the inherent volatility of the stock market, I'm adjusting the probability of a rise slightly downward from the highest previous predictions to account for potential market corrections or unforeseen events.
