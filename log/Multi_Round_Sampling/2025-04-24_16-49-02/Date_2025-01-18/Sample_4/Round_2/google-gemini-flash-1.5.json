(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the resilience and growth potential of Apple, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent revenue growth despite challenges in iPhone sales. The article emphasizes the importance of long-term investment and the historical performance of Apple, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. Given the positive sentiment around Apple's ability to innovate and maintain its market position, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple (AAPL) is one of Warren Buffett's 'forever' stocks. This implies a strong endorsement of the company's long-term value and stability. Buffett's reputation as a value investor often leads to increased investor confidence and potential buying pressure. However, the headline is vague and doesn't provide specific details about why Apple is considered a 'forever' stock. The impact is likely to be positive, but not dramatically so, as Apple is already a widely held and analyzed stock. The lack of specific details limits the potential for a significant price surge. Also, the article mentions '2 Warren Buffett Stocks', so the impact is diluted as it is not solely focused on Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's continued confidence in Apple, citing its strong performance, growing customer base, expanding services business, and high profit margins.  While the article mentions the stock price being expensive, it suggests dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to mitigate risk.  The positive outlook on Apple's future growth, driven by factors like AI integration and a robust services sector, outweighs the concern about current valuation.  The mention of past successful investments in Apple by the Motley Fool, while potentially biased, further reinforces a positive sentiment. However, it's crucial to remember that even strong companies can experience short-term price fluctuations due to broader market conditions or unforeseen events. Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, a complete absence of the possibility of a fall is unrealistic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's long-term investment strategy and highlights the success of holding stocks like Apple (AAPL) over many years, emphasizing the resilience of Apple's services segment and its continued dominance in the smartphone market. The positive sentiment and strong historical performance of Apple, coupled with the author's conviction in the company's future growth, suggest a favorable outlook for the stock. However, the article does not introduce any new, immediate catalysts that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is low, given the overall positive tone and lack of negative indicators.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc.

Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in Apple and Warren Buffett's statement that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year suggest a positive outlook for the company. Based on this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to the positive sentiment and confidence expressed by Warren Buffett and the growth prospects of the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's positive stance on Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals, increasing user base, and expanding services. Buffett's endorsement and his belief in holding the stock forever adds significant credibility. Apple's growth in services revenue and expansion into AI indicate strategic moves for future profitability. While the stock is currently expensive, the long-term view supported by high-margin revenues and potential innovations like Apple Intelligence suggest positive outlooks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's resilience and growth potential, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent revenue growth despite challenges in iPhone sales.

The 'forever stock' designation implies long-term value and stability, reinforcing investor confidence.

However, the article is not solely focused on Apple, sharing the spotlight with Amazon, and the positive sentiment is not a new revelation.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.6 to 0.8 for the probability of a price rise, and the inherent uncertainty in the stock market, a conservative estimate is warranted. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a price rise, but not a dramatic one.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc.
