(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the resilience and growth potential of Apple, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent revenue growth despite challenges in iPhone sales. The historical performance of Apple stock, with a significant return since its entry into the $1 trillion market cap club, suggests strong investor confidence. Additionally, the overall positive sentiment towards long-term investments in successful companies, as illustrated by the author's portfolio, supports a bullish outlook for Apple. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article is generally positive for Apple. It highlights Apple's resilience, strong performance in its services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The article emphasizes that selling Apple stock too soon would have been a costly mistake, given its significant returns. While the article acknowledges concerns about slowing iPhone sales and the uncertain economy, it ultimately paints a picture of a strong and resilient company. The mention of past 'double down' recommendations with significant returns further reinforces a positive outlook. However, the article is from a single investor's perspective and doesn't contain any new, groundbreaking information that would drastically alter market sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a significant price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is lower, as the news reinforces existing positive perceptions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price over the next five years. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand, substantial revenue, and successful transition towards services, the analysis highlights concerns about valuation and future growth.  The article points out that Apple's P/E ratio is high, suggesting the stock might be overvalued.  The projected EPS growth of 11.4% annually over the next three years, even if sustained, combined with a potential P/E ratio contraction to 30, only leads to a projected 34% stock price increase in five years. This is considered modest given the current valuation. The maturity of the iPhone market and potential for slower upgrade cycles also contribute to a cautious outlook.  The article's conclusion leans towards a less optimistic view, suggesting that significant returns are unlikely unless the valuation drops substantially.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is assigned a lower value than the probability of a price fall or stagnation, reflecting the cautious tone and valuation concerns expressed.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, loyal customer base, and growth in services revenue, which are positive indicators for the company's future. Warren Buffett's endorsement and Berkshire Hathaway's continued large holding in Apple add credibility and investor confidence. The mention of Apple Intelligence and AI integration could drive future upgrades and growth. However, the article also notes that the stock has gotten expensive, which might limit short-term upside. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's positive experience with Apple (AAPL) stock, highlighting its resilience and growth despite challenges. The author mentions that Apple's services segment generated significant revenue and that the company continued to dominate the global smartphone market. This positive outlook and the author's decision to hold onto the stock despite its challenges suggest a bullish perspective on Apple's future performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's past performance and future prospects. While Apple has been a dominant force in the tech industry, the article notes that the company's valuation has gotten richer, with a current P/E ratio of 38.4, which is rarely more expensive in the past decade. The article also mentions that Wall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years, but this growth may not be enough to justify the current valuation. Additionally, the article suggests that the iPhone, which drives a significant portion of Apple's sales, is becoming more mature, and consumers may not feel the need to upgrade as often. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's positive stance on Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals, increasing user base, and expanding services. Buffett's endorsement and his belief in holding the stock forever adds significant credibility. Apple's growth in services revenue and expansion into AI indicate strategic moves for future profitability. While the stock is currently expensive, the long-term view supported by high-margin revenues and potential innovations like Apple Intelligence suggest positive outlooks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
