(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights the resilience and growth potential of Apple, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent revenue growth despite challenges in iPhone sales. The historical performance of Apple stock, with a significant return since its entry into the $1 trillion market cap club, suggests strong investor confidence. Additionally, the overall positive sentiment towards long-term investments in successful companies, as illustrated by the author's portfolio, supports a bullish outlook for Apple. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article is generally positive for Apple. It highlights Apple's resilience, strong performance in its services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The article emphasizes that selling Apple stock too soon would have been a costly mistake, given its significant returns. While the article acknowledges concerns about slowing iPhone sales and the uncertain economy, it ultimately paints a picture of a strong and resilient company. The mention of past 'double down' recommendations with significant returns further reinforces a positive outlook. However, the article is from a single investor's perspective and doesn't contain any new, groundbreaking information that would drastically alter market sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a significant price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is lower, as the news reinforces existing positive perceptions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price over the next five years. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand, substantial revenue, and successful transition towards services, the analysis highlights concerns about valuation and future growth.  The article points out that Apple's P/E ratio is high, suggesting the stock might be overvalued.  The projected EPS growth of 11.4% annually over the next three years, even if sustained, combined with a potential P/E ratio contraction to 30, only leads to a projected 34% stock price increase in five years. This is considered modest given the current valuation. The maturity of the iPhone market and potential for slower upgrade cycles also contribute to a cautious outlook.  The article's conclusion leans towards a less optimistic view, suggesting that significant returns are unlikely unless the valuation drops substantially.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is assigned a lower value than the probability of a price fall or stagnation, reflecting the cautious tone and valuation concerns expressed.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, loyal customer base, and growth in services revenue, which are positive indicators for the company's future. Warren Buffett's endorsement and Berkshire Hathaway's continued large holding in Apple add credibility and investor confidence. The mention of Apple Intelligence and AI integration could drive future upgrades and growth. However, the article also notes that the stock has gotten expensive, which might limit short-term upside. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's positive experience with Apple (AAPL) stock, highlighting its resilience and growth despite challenges. The author mentions that Apple's services segment generated significant revenue and that the company continued to dominate the global smartphone market. This positive outlook and the author's decision to hold onto the stock despite its challenges suggest a bullish perspective on Apple's future performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's past performance and future prospects. While Apple has been a dominant force in the tech industry, the article notes that the company's valuation has gotten richer, with a current P/E ratio of 38.4, which is rarely more expensive in the past decade. The article also mentions that Wall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years, but this growth may not be enough to justify the current valuation. Additionally, the article suggests that the iPhone, which drives a significant portion of Apple's sales, is becoming more mature, and consumers may not feel the need to upgrade as often. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's positive stance on Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals, increasing user base, and expanding services. Buffett's endorsement and his belief in holding the stock forever adds significant credibility. Apple's growth in services revenue and expansion into AI indicate strategic moves for future profitability. While the stock is currently expensive, the long-term view supported by high-margin revenues and potential innovations like Apple Intelligence suggest positive outlooks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's resilience and growth potential, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent revenue growth despite challenges in iPhone sales. The historical performance of Apple stock, with significant returns since its entry into the $1 trillion market cap club, suggests strong investor confidence. While there are concerns about slowing iPhone sales and high valuation, the overall sentiment remains positive, supported by the author's long-term investment perspective and the lessons learned from holding successful stocks. This leads to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive, albeit retrospective, view of Apple. It highlights the author's successful investment in Apple over the long term, emphasizing the resilience of the services segment and continued dominance in the smartphone market. While the article acknowledges concerns about slowing iPhone sales and the uncertain economy, it ultimately reinforces a positive perception of the company's long-term value. The previous round of predictions shows a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall, reflecting the inherent uncertainties. Considering the slightly positive tone of the article and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a more balanced view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's strengths \u2013 strong brand, successful services segment, and cash flow generation \u2013 it also emphasizes concerns about valuation and future growth. The high P/E ratio suggests potential overvaluation, and the projected EPS growth, while positive, may not be sufficient to justify the current price.  The maturity of the iPhone market is another factor contributing to a cautious outlook.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of any significantly new information, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement. The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but the uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for both rise and fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong fundamentals, including a growing and loyal customer base, significant growth in services revenue, and strategic investments in AI and new products. Warren Buffett's endorsement and Berkshire Hathaway's continued large holding in Apple add substantial credibility and investor confidence. While the article notes that the stock has become expensive, the long-term growth potential and high-margin revenues outweigh this concern. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a positive outlook, with most assigning higher probabilities to a stock price rise. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is assessed to be higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's positive experience with Apple (AAPL) stock, highlighting its resilience and growth despite challenges. The author mentions that Apple's services segment generated significant revenue and that the company continued to dominate the global smartphone market. Several models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising, citing Apple's strong financial performance, loyal customer base, and growth in services revenue as positive indicators. However, some models also express caution due to the stock's high valuation and potential for slower growth. Overall, the positive aspects and long-term growth potential seem to outweigh the negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price over the next five years. While it highlights the company's strong brand, substantial revenue, and successful transition towards services, it also raises concerns about valuation and future growth. The article notes that Apple's P/E ratio is high, suggesting the stock might be overvalued, and projects a modest 34% stock price increase over the next five years. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions from bullish to cautious, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including its growing installed base of devices and increasing services revenue. Warren Buffett's continued endorsement and large holdings in Apple reinforce investor confidence. Despite concerns about the stock being expensive and slower iPhone sales, the overall positive outlook from multiple sources suggests a higher likelihood of stock price rise. However, the valuation concerns and potential slower growth in the mature iPhone market contribute to a cautious outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong performance, particularly in its services segment, which has shown consistent growth despite challenges in iPhone sales. The historical performance of Apple stock, with significant returns since its entry into the $1 trillion market cap club, suggests strong investor confidence.

This leads to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a retrospective view of an investor's successful long-term holdings, including Apple. While it highlights Apple's resilience, strong services segment, and market dominance, it also acknowledges concerns about slowing iPhone sales and a potentially high valuation. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with a slight overall leaning towards a price rise. Considering the lack of significantly new information and the already factored-in concerns, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect a slightly more cautious outlook, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement, but still leaning slightly towards a rise due to the positive long-term perspective presented in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights positive aspects like strong brand, successful services segment, and cash flow generation, it also raises significant concerns about valuation and future growth. The high P/E ratio suggests potential overvaluation, and projected EPS growth, while positive, may not justify the current price.  The maturity of the iPhone market adds to the cautious outlook.  Previous predictions are varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of any significantly new information, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement. The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but the uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for both rise and fall.  The fact that the article itself concludes that significant returns are unlikely unless the valuation drops substantially weighs heavily on the prediction.  The previous rounds show a convergence towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but the inherent uncertainty remains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a highly positive outlook on Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals, loyal customer base, and significant growth in services revenue. Warren Buffett's endorsement and Berkshire Hathaway's substantial holdings in Apple add considerable credibility and investor confidence. The article also highlights Apple's strategic investments in AI and new products, which could drive future growth.
