If Nvidia struggles, it could impact the competitive landscape for Apple, especially in areas like gaming and self-driving technology where both companies have interests. However, the news does not directly indicate any negative impact on Apple, and given Apple's strong market position and product ecosystem, the overall sentiment may remain stable.
