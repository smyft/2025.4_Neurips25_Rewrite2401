However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks to sell. Given that the news does not directly target Apple Inc., the impact on its stock price is likely to be minimal. However, since the news is about potential drops in AI-related stocks, and Apple is a major player in AI technology through its products and services like Siri and Core ML, investors might still react cautiously. The overall sentiment of the news is negative towards AI stocks, but without direct mention, the probabilities reflect a cautious market response.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
