While Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, this news directly impacts Berkshire Hathaway's future leadership and culture, not Apple's operations or financial performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Any movement would be indirect and potentially driven by overall market sentiment towards Berkshire Hathaway's future prospects, which is difficult to predict with certainty based solely on this news. Given the indirect nature of the impact, I'm assigning probabilities close to 50% for both rise and fall, reflecting a neutral outlook.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett Prepares His Middle Child for the Job of a Lifetime\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
