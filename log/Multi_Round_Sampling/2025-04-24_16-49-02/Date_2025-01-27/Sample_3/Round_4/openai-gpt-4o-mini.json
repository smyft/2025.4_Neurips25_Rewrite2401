(AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market\nNews Content: Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.\n\nNew developments from Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.\n\nNvidia stock was set to open lower by more than 11%. Meanwhile fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off about 5% or more in pre-market trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ES=F)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nA slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With with index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.\n\nBut unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.\n\nIn 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the \"Magnificent Seven\" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.\n\nAs Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 22: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on January 22, 2025 in New York City. Stocks continued an upward swing opening up high a day after the Dow Jones closed up 500 points and the S&P 500 approaching an all-time high. The rise comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison made an announcement alongside President Donald Trump that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. (Photo by Michael M.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple. The concerns over competition in the AI space, particularly from DeepSeek, have led to a broader market reaction that could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', which is expected to see a slowdown in earnings growth, this could further contribute to a bearish outlook. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising in the immediate term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on potential TikTok restrictions. While this could indirectly benefit Instagram and, by extension, Meta, the impact on Apple is minimal and largely indirect.  The article primarily discusses Meta's strategies and financial investments in content creators.  Apple's stock price movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Meta's internal promotional campaigns. The news does not contain any information directly related to Apple's financial performance, product releases, or any other factors that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its ability to drive significant growth, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in wearables and accessories. The analyst's comments suggest that AI is not yet a strong catalyst for Apple, which may dampen investor enthusiasm. Additionally, competition from cheaper Chinese AI models and challenges in key product segments could negatively impact sentiment. However, Apple's strong brand and existing market position may provide some support. Overall, the news leans slightly negative for Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple enhancing its App Store tools and experiencing surging iOS 18 adoption rates is likely to have a positive impact on the company's stock price. The updates to the App Store platform, including improved app management tools, enhanced analytics, and a streamlined App Review process, are expected to attract more developers and improve the overall user experience. This, combined with the high adoption rates of iOS 18 (76% of new iPhones and 63% of new iPads), suggests that Apple's ecosystem is strengthening, which could lead to increased revenue and customer loyalty. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive trend for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as its stock price jumped 3.7% due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for its iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the existing concerns and downgrades.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. Apple is mentioned as one of the few companies that has gained slightly, likely due to its diversified offerings beyond AI. However, the overall sentiment in the market is bearish, and Apple's inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' could make it susceptible to broader market trends.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple. The emergence of competition from DeepSeek in the AI space raises concerns about future earnings growth for Apple and its peers. While Apple has strong fundamentals and a solid market position, the overall bearish sentiment in the market and the potential for a slowdown in earnings growth contribute to a higher probability of a stock price decline. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking (6th) on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This is a positive signal. However, the article also discusses concerns about high valuations in the tech sector, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' (which includes Apple), and the potential for a 'catch down' scenario if the broader corporate universe doesn't see the value in AI. JPMorgan also highlights the risk of escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The previous round of predictions shows a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. Given the positive AI investment news balanced by valuation concerns and potential risks, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategic moves to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple's performance.  While increased competition in the social media space might indirectly impact Apple's App Store revenue in the long term, the direct impact of this news on Apple's stock price is negligible. The news provides no information about Apple's financials, product releases, or other factors that would significantly influence its stock price.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement in the short term. Given the lack of direct relevance, I assign a low probability to both a rise and a fall, leaning slightly towards no change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its ability to drive significant growth, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in wearables and accessories.

These updates improve app management, user experience, and developer tools, which are likely to attract more developers and strengthen Apple's position in the app market. The positive updates to the App Store platform, combined with the high adoption rates of iOS 18, suggest a favorable impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the previous predictions and the mixed sentiments about Apple's stock, the probabilities should reflect a cautiously optimistic outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple's stock jumped 3.7% due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for its iPhones, and JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. On the other hand, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering the positive impact of AI advancements and the raised estimates, but also taking into account the existing concerns and downgrades, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. The emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and its potential to disrupt the AI landscape also introduces uncertainty. However, Apple's diversified offerings and strong brand may provide some resilience against negative market trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. Apple is mentioned as one of the few companies that has gained slightly, likely due to its diversified offerings beyond AI. However, the overall sentiment in the market is bearish, and Apple's inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' could make it susceptible to broader market trends. The news suggests that AI is becoming a focal point for competition, which may not directly impact Apple's core product lines but could affect investor sentiment. Despite Apple's resilience, the broader tech sector sell-off and investor cautiousness indicate a higher likelihood of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple.

Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks. While this is a positive signal, the article also discusses concerns about high valuations in the tech sector, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' (which includes Apple), and the potential for a 'catch down' scenario. JPMorgan also highlights the risk of escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight shift towards a more positive outlook compared to round 0, but still with considerable uncertainty. The AI investment news is a positive factor, but valuation concerns and potential risks temper the optimism. The fact that JPMorgan suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe also weighs on the potential for AAPL to rise significantly. Considering all these factors, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's efforts to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban by promoting Instagram. This news is largely irrelevant to Apple.  There's no direct impact on Apple's financials, products, or strategies mentioned. While a TikTok ban *could* indirectly benefit Instagram and thus Meta, the effect on Apple is likely minimal and uncertain.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the overall uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement in the short term.  Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed signals from previous predictions, I assign a low probability to both a rise and a fall in Apple's stock price due to this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its ability to drive significant growth, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in wearables and accessories.

However, the Meta news itself provides no significant catalyst for either a rise or fall in Apple's stock price.
