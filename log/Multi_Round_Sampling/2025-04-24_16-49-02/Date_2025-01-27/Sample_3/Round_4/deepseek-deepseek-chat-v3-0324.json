(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\n\nguteksk7/Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple. The concerns over competition in the AI space, particularly from DeepSeek, have led to a broader market reaction that could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', which is expected to see a slowdown in earnings growth, this could further contribute to a bearish outlook. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising in the immediate term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on potential TikTok restrictions. While this could indirectly benefit Instagram and, by extension, Meta, the impact on Apple is minimal and largely indirect.  The article primarily discusses Meta's strategies and financial investments in content creators.  Apple's stock price movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Meta's internal promotional campaigns. The news does not contain any information directly related to Apple's financial performance, product releases, or any other factors that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its ability to drive significant growth, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in wearables and accessories. The analyst's comments suggest that AI is not yet a strong catalyst for Apple, which may dampen investor enthusiasm. Additionally, competition from cheaper Chinese AI models and challenges in key product segments could negatively impact sentiment. However, Apple's strong brand and existing market position may provide some support. Overall, the news leans slightly negative for Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple enhancing its App Store tools and experiencing surging iOS 18 adoption rates is likely to have a positive impact on the company's stock price. The updates to the App Store platform, including improved app management tools, enhanced analytics, and a streamlined App Review process, are expected to attract more developers and improve the overall user experience. This, combined with the high adoption rates of iOS 18 (76% of new iPhones and 63% of new iPads), suggests that Apple's ecosystem is strengthening, which could lead to increased revenue and customer loyalty. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive trend for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as its stock price jumped 3.7% due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for its iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the existing concerns and downgrades.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. Apple is mentioned as one of the few companies that has gained slightly, likely due to its diversified offerings beyond AI. However, the overall sentiment in the market is bearish, and Apple's inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' could make it susceptible to broader market trends.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple. The emergence of competition from DeepSeek in the AI space raises concerns about future earnings growth for Apple and its peers. While Apple has strong fundamentals and a solid market position, the overall bearish sentiment in the market and the potential for a slowdown in earnings growth contribute to a higher probability of a stock price decline. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking (6th) on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This is a positive signal. However, the article also discusses concerns about high valuations in the tech sector, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' (which includes Apple), and the potential for a 'catch down' scenario if the broader corporate universe doesn't see the value in AI. JPMorgan also highlights the risk of escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The previous round of predictions shows a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. Given the positive AI investment news balanced by valuation concerns and potential risks, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategic moves to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple's performance.  While increased competition in the social media space might indirectly impact Apple's App Store revenue in the long term, the direct impact of this news on Apple's stock price is negligible. The news provides no information about Apple's financials, product releases, or other factors that would significantly influence its stock price.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement in the short term. Given the lack of direct relevance, I assign a low probability to both a rise and a fall, leaning slightly towards no change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its ability to drive significant growth, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in wearables and accessories.

These updates improve app management, user experience, and developer tools, which are likely to attract more developers and strengthen Apple's position in the app market. The positive updates to the App Store platform, combined with the high adoption rates of iOS 18, suggest a favorable impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the previous predictions and the mixed sentiments about Apple's stock, the probabilities should reflect a cautiously optimistic outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple's stock jumped 3.7% due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for its iPhones, and JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. On the other hand, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering the positive impact of AI advancements and the raised estimates, but also taking into account the existing concerns and downgrades, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. The emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and its potential to disrupt the AI landscape also introduces uncertainty. However, Apple's diversified offerings and strong brand may provide some resilience against negative market trends.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. Apple is mentioned as one of the few companies that has gained slightly, likely due to its diversified offerings beyond AI. However, the overall sentiment in the market is bearish, and Apple's inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' could make it susceptible to broader market trends. The news suggests that AI is becoming a focal point for competition, which may not directly impact Apple's core product lines but could affect investor sentiment. Despite Apple's resilience, the broader tech sector sell-off and investor cautiousness indicate a higher likelihood of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple.

Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks. While this is a positive signal, the article also discusses concerns about high valuations in the tech sector, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' (which includes Apple), and the potential for a 'catch down' scenario. JPMorgan also highlights the risk of escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight shift towards a more positive outlook compared to round 0, but still with considerable uncertainty. The AI investment news is a positive factor, but valuation concerns and potential risks temper the optimism. The fact that JPMorgan suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe also weighs on the potential for AAPL to rise significantly. Considering all these factors, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's efforts to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban by promoting Instagram. This news is largely irrelevant to Apple.  There's no direct impact on Apple's financials, products, or strategies mentioned. While a TikTok ban *could* indirectly benefit Instagram and thus Meta, the effect on Apple is likely minimal and uncertain.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the overall uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement in the short term.  Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed signals from previous predictions, I assign a low probability to both a rise and a fall in Apple's stock price due to this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its ability to drive significant growth, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in wearables and accessories.

The consensus leans slightly towards a belief that the stock is more likely to fall than rise, primarily due to broader market concerns about the tech sector, AI competition, and potential economic slowdowns. However, the Meta news itself provides no significant catalyst for either a rise or fall in Apple's stock price. Therefore, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly favoring no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its ability to drive significant growth, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in wearables and accessories.
