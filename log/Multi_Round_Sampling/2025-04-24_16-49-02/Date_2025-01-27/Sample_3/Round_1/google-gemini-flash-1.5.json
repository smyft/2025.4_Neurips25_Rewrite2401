(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\nNews Content: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\n\nMeta\u00a0Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is trying to promoteInstagram by exploiting the absence of the Chinese rival TikTok download option from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google stores.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok, citing national security threats due to its ownership by ByteDance Ltd. However, recently, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay the TikTok ban after assuming charge as the new President on January 20.\n\nAlso Read: BYD, Geely, SAIC Contest EU\u2019s High EV Tariffs In Court\n\nPreviously, the Biden administration ordered ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face an effective ban on the app in the U.S. on January 19.\n\nTikTok, has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for ~4% of the U.S. digital ad market. Around 63% of teens aged 13 to 17 use TikTok compared to 59% who use Instagram, CNBC cites a 2023\u00a0Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent encouraged creators to promote Instagram on other short-form video apps, like TikTok, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube including three months of posting exclusivity by doling out attractive offers, CNBC cites from a creator contract details.\n\nMeta\u2019s monthly cash bonuses ranged from $10,000 to $50,000 to shift their videos to Instagram Reels, CNBC cites the Information. The deals last six months and obligate a creator to post a minimum of eight Instagram Reels per month.\n\nMeta paid over $2 billion to content creators\u00a0in 2024. Four million content creators have reportedly made money from the platform since 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies, includingOracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder and Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, emerged as eligible contenders for\u00a0TikTok after Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days.\n\nMETA Stock Prediction For 2025\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Meta through iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW) and Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ).\n\nPrice Action: META stock is down 1.57% at $637.71 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nQualcomm Gains $2 Billion Boost From Samsung S25 Chipset Deal, Analyst Highlights Growth in Handsets and Beyond\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple. The concerns over competition in the AI space, particularly from DeepSeek, have led to a broader market reaction that could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', which is expected to see a slowdown in earnings growth, this could further contribute to a bearish outlook. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising in the immediate term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on potential TikTok restrictions. While this could indirectly benefit Instagram and, by extension, Meta, the impact on Apple is minimal and largely indirect.  The article primarily discusses Meta's strategies and financial investments in content creators.  Apple's stock price movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Meta's internal promotional campaigns. The news does not contain any information directly related to Apple's financial performance, product releases, or any other factors that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its ability to drive significant growth, coupled with declining revenue in China and weak performance in wearables and accessories. The analyst's comments suggest that AI is not yet a strong catalyst for Apple, which may dampen investor enthusiasm. Additionally, competition from cheaper Chinese AI models and challenges in key product segments could negatively impact sentiment. However, Apple's strong brand and existing market position may provide some support. Overall, the news leans slightly negative for Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple enhancing its App Store tools and experiencing surging iOS 18 adoption rates is likely to have a positive impact on the company's stock price. The updates to the App Store platform, including improved app management tools, enhanced analytics, and a streamlined App Review process, are expected to attract more developers and improve the overall user experience. This, combined with the high adoption rates of iOS 18 (76% of new iPhones and 63% of new iPads), suggests that Apple's ecosystem is strengthening, which could lead to increased revenue and customer loyalty. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive trend for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as its stock price jumped 3.7% due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for its iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the existing concerns and downgrades.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. Apple is mentioned as one of the few companies that has gained slightly, likely due to its diversified offerings beyond AI. However, the overall sentiment in the market is bearish, and Apple's inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' could make it susceptible to broader market trends.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
