      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights a temporary surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While this demonstrates TikTok's popularity and user frustration, it's unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is evolving. The increased demand for specific iPhones is a niche market and doesn't fundamentally alter Apple's overall business or revenue streams. The news is more of a curiosity than a substantial driver of Apple's stock. The advertisements within the article are irrelevant to the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include a significant jump in iPhone build estimates for the first half of 2025, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from China, and the potential for increased on-device AI capabilities due to the emergence of more cost-effective AI models.  This is further supported by Apple's outperformance compared to other tech giants amidst concerns about AI cost deflation. However, counterbalancing these positives are lingering concerns about iPhone sales, reflected in recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, and the stock being 12% off recent highs. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.  The overall impact of the DeepSeek news on Apple is less direct than on companies heavily invested in AI infrastructure. While the cost-effective AI model could indirectly benefit Apple, the immediate market reaction seems more driven by the positive iPhone sales forecast and the relative outperformance compared to other tech giants facing AI-related headwinds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a sell-off in big tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to concerns over competition in the AI space sparked by developments from DeepSeek. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are experiencing pre-market declines, with Nvidia down 11% and others like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla down around 5% or more. The article suggests that the rapid earnings growth of big tech, a key driver of the bull market, is being questioned due to the emergence of competitive AI models. Given the broader market sentiment and the pre-market trends, it is likely that Apple's stock will also face downward pressure in the short term. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the impact compared to more AI-focused peers.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's strengthening position in AI with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, it also mentions a BofA analyst lowering the price target for Apple from $256 to $253 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating. The analyst cites a weak macro environment and the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features as reasons for the lowered iPhone units estimate. Despite this, the analyst remains optimistic about Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive, as it highlights Apple's AI advancements and the analyst's continued confidence in the company's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news mentions that the tech sector is tumbling due to the newest artificial intelligence model developed by China's DeepSeek, which could potentially impact Apple's stock price. Additionally, the company is set to report earnings this week, which can be a significant factor in stock price movement. However, the Federal Reserve's January policy meeting and potential interest rate move could also influence the market. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the negative impact of the DeepSeek AI news on the tech sector. Nevertheless, the upcoming earnings report could provide a positive surprise, which is factored into the estimated probabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown declining estimates for future fiscal years and concerns over China and AI strategy have caused a drop in share price. On the other hand, there are optimistic views suggesting that these concerns may be overblown, and Apple could announce a local AI partner soon. The upcoming earnings report is expected to provide clarity.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This is compounded by the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, adding uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. While there are some positive factors regarding Apple's iPhone demand and potential AI advancements, the immediate market reaction seems more influenced by the broader tech sell-off. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a temporary and unusual surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a ban. While this demonstrates TikTok's popularity, it's unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is evolving. The increased demand for specific iPhones is a niche market and doesn't fundamentally alter Apple's overall business or revenue streams. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a fall due to broader tech sector concerns and others seeing potential for a rise. Considering the limited impact of this specific news on Apple's core business, I believe the stock price is more likely to remain stable or experience a slight rise due to the positive buzz, but the effect will be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the positive iPhone sales forecast from JPMorgan and the potential benefits of cheaper AI models for on-device AI are bullish factors,  the overall market sentiment is negative due to DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model impacting the broader tech sector.  This negative sentiment is amplified by previous downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, and Apple's stock being 12% off its highs.  The upcoming earnings report is a major wildcard.  While the $126 billion revenue expectation is positive, a miss could trigger further downward pressure. Considering the conflicting signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's short-term prospects.  I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall due to the prevailing negative market sentiment and the risk associated with the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc.

Additionally, the article highlights the competitive landscape in AI, with developments from DeepSeek causing concerns in the tech sector. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher due to Apple's AI advancements and the analyst's continued confidence in the company's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling and others suggesting a more neutral or slightly positive outlook, I have taken a balanced approach. The overall trend from previous predictions suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the immediate market reaction to the DeepSeek news and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings reports. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown declining estimates for future fiscal years and concerns over China and AI strategy have caused a drop in share price. On the other hand, there are optimistic views suggesting that these concerns may be overblown, and Apple could announce a local AI partner soon. The upcoming earnings report is expected to provide clarity. The various predictions from different models suggest a range of opinions, but most lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to current market sentiment and recent negative trends.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This broader market reaction is compounded by the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, adding uncertainty. While there are some positive factors regarding Apple's iPhone demand and potential AI advancements, the immediate market reaction seems more influenced by the overall tech sell-off. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on a temporary and unusual situation: iPhones with TikTok installed selling for exorbitant prices due to a ban. While this highlights TikTok's popularity, it's a niche market and unlikely to significantly impact Apple's overall revenue or long-term stock performance. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is evolving. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a fall due to broader tech sector concerns and others seeing potential for a rise. Considering the limited impact of this specific news on Apple's core business, I believe the stock price is more likely to remain stable or experience a slight rise due to the positive buzz, but the effect will be minimal. The fact that the ban was lifted relatively quickly diminishes the long-term impact. The high prices are driven by desperation and scarcity, not a fundamental shift in Apple's value.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include increased iPhone build estimates driven by strong Chinese demand and the potential for improved on-device AI due to cheaper AI model development.  Apple's outperformance relative to other tech giants facing AI cost deflation concerns is also a positive sign. However, counterbalancing these are persistent concerns about iPhone sales, reflected in recent downgrades, and the stock trading 12% below recent highs. The upcoming earnings report is a major uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  While the positive iPhone sales news and relative strength are bullish, the broader tech sell-off and lingering sales concerns suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. The DeepSeek news, while potentially beneficial to Apple long-term, is currently contributing to negative market sentiment.  Considering the balance of these factors, and the consensus leaning towards a fall in previous rounds, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc.

This, combined with the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, adds uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted.

This is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's overall revenue or stock performance. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is evolving. While it highlights TikTok's popularity, it's a niche market and doesn't fundamentally alter Apple's value. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a fall due to broader tech sector concerns and others seeing potential for a rise.

Positive factors include increased iPhone build estimates driven by strong Chinese demand and the potential for improved on-device AI due to cheaper AI model development. Apple's relative outperformance compared to other tech giants facing AI cost deflation is also bullish. However, counterbalancing these are persistent concerns about iPhone sales, reflected in recent downgrades, and the stock trading 12% below recent highs. The upcoming earnings report is a major wildcard.  The previous predictions from various AI models show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  Most models lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily due to the broader tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and the lingering concerns about iPhone sales.  While the positive iPhone sales news and relative strength are bullish, the negative market sentiment and the risk associated with the upcoming earnings report outweigh the positives in the short term.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the significant uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc.

The analyst cites a weak macro environment and the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features as reasons for the lowered iPhone units estimate. Additionally, the competitive landscape in AI, with developments from DeepSeek causing concerns in the tech sector, is a factor. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly lower due to the immediate market reaction to the DeepSeek news and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings reports. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the impact. Based on the analysis of previous predictions and the current news, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.38 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.62.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, causing stock futures to fall.
