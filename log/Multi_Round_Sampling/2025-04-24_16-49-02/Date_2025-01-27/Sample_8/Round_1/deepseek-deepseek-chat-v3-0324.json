(AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market\nNews Content: Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.\n\nNew developments from Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.\n\nNvidia stock was set to open lower by more than 11%. Meanwhile fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off about 5% or more in pre-market trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ES=F)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nA slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With with index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.\n\nBut unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.\n\nIn 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the \"Magnificent Seven\" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.\n\nAs Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 22: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on January 22, 2025 in New York City. Stocks continued an upward swing opening up high a day after the Dow Jones closed up 500 points and the S&P 500 approaching an all-time high. The rise comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison made an announcement alongside President Donald Trump that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. (Photo by Michael M.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights a temporary surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While this demonstrates TikTok's popularity and user frustration, it's unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is evolving. The increased demand for specific iPhones is a niche market and doesn't fundamentally alter Apple's overall business or revenue streams. The news is more of a curiosity than a substantial driver of Apple's stock. The advertisements within the article are irrelevant to the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include a significant jump in iPhone build estimates for the first half of 2025, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from China, and the potential for increased on-device AI capabilities due to the emergence of more cost-effective AI models.  This is further supported by Apple's outperformance compared to other tech giants amidst concerns about AI cost deflation. However, counterbalancing these positives are lingering concerns about iPhone sales, reflected in recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, and the stock being 12% off recent highs. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.  The overall impact of the DeepSeek news on Apple is less direct than on companies heavily invested in AI infrastructure. While the cost-effective AI model could indirectly benefit Apple, the immediate market reaction seems more driven by the positive iPhone sales forecast and the relative outperformance compared to other tech giants facing AI-related headwinds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a sell-off in big tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to concerns over competition in the AI space sparked by developments from DeepSeek. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are experiencing pre-market declines, with Nvidia down 11% and others like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla down around 5% or more. The article suggests that the rapid earnings growth of big tech, a key driver of the bull market, is being questioned due to the emergence of competitive AI models. Given the broader market sentiment and the pre-market trends, it is likely that Apple's stock will also face downward pressure in the short term. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the impact compared to more AI-focused peers.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's strengthening position in AI with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, it also mentions a BofA analyst lowering the price target for Apple from $256 to $253 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating. The analyst cites a weak macro environment and the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features as reasons for the lowered iPhone units estimate. Despite this, the analyst remains optimistic about Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive, as it highlights Apple's AI advancements and the analyst's continued confidence in the company's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news mentions that the tech sector is tumbling due to the newest artificial intelligence model developed by China's DeepSeek, which could potentially impact Apple's stock price. Additionally, the company is set to report earnings this week, which can be a significant factor in stock price movement. However, the Federal Reserve's January policy meeting and potential interest rate move could also influence the market. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the negative impact of the DeepSeek AI news on the tech sector. Nevertheless, the upcoming earnings report could provide a positive surprise, which is factored into the estimated probabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown declining estimates for future fiscal years and concerns over China and AI strategy have caused a drop in share price. On the other hand, there are optimistic views suggesting that these concerns may be overblown, and Apple could announce a local AI partner soon. The upcoming earnings report is expected to provide clarity.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
