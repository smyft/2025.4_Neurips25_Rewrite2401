(AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights a temporary surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While this demonstrates TikTok's popularity and user frustration, it's unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is evolving. The increased demand for specific iPhones is a niche market and doesn't fundamentally alter Apple's overall business or revenue streams. The news is more of a curiosity than a substantial driver of Apple's stock. The advertisements within the article are irrelevant to the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include a significant jump in iPhone build estimates for the first half of 2025, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from China, and the potential for increased on-device AI capabilities due to the emergence of more cost-effective AI models.  This is further supported by Apple's outperformance compared to other tech giants amidst concerns about AI cost deflation. However, counterbalancing these positives are lingering concerns about iPhone sales, reflected in recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, and the stock being 12% off recent highs. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.  The overall impact of the DeepSeek news on Apple is less direct than on companies heavily invested in AI infrastructure. While the cost-effective AI model could indirectly benefit Apple, the immediate market reaction seems more driven by the positive iPhone sales forecast and the relative outperformance compared to other tech giants facing AI-related headwinds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a sell-off in big tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to concerns over competition in the AI space sparked by developments from DeepSeek. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are experiencing pre-market declines, with Nvidia down 11% and others like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla down around 5% or more. The article suggests that the rapid earnings growth of big tech, a key driver of the bull market, is being questioned due to the emergence of competitive AI models. Given the broader market sentiment and the pre-market trends, it is likely that Apple's stock will also face downward pressure in the short term. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the impact compared to more AI-focused peers.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's strengthening position in AI with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, it also mentions a BofA analyst lowering the price target for Apple from $256 to $253 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating. The analyst cites a weak macro environment and the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features as reasons for the lowered iPhone units estimate. Despite this, the analyst remains optimistic about Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive, as it highlights Apple's AI advancements and the analyst's continued confidence in the company's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news mentions that the tech sector is tumbling due to the newest artificial intelligence model developed by China's DeepSeek, which could potentially impact Apple's stock price. Additionally, the company is set to report earnings this week, which can be a significant factor in stock price movement. However, the Federal Reserve's January policy meeting and potential interest rate move could also influence the market. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the negative impact of the DeepSeek AI news on the tech sector. Nevertheless, the upcoming earnings report could provide a positive surprise, which is factored into the estimated probabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown declining estimates for future fiscal years and concerns over China and AI strategy have caused a drop in share price. On the other hand, there are optimistic views suggesting that these concerns may be overblown, and Apple could announce a local AI partner soon. The upcoming earnings report is expected to provide clarity.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This is compounded by the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, adding uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. While there are some positive factors regarding Apple's iPhone demand and potential AI advancements, the immediate market reaction seems more influenced by the broader tech sell-off. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a temporary and unusual surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a ban. While this demonstrates TikTok's popularity, it's unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is evolving. The increased demand for specific iPhones is a niche market and doesn't fundamentally alter Apple's overall business or revenue streams. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a fall due to broader tech sector concerns and others seeing potential for a rise. Considering the limited impact of this specific news on Apple's core business, I believe the stock price is more likely to remain stable or experience a slight rise due to the positive buzz, but the effect will be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the positive iPhone sales forecast from JPMorgan and the potential benefits of cheaper AI models for on-device AI are bullish factors,  the overall market sentiment is negative due to DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model impacting the broader tech sector.  This negative sentiment is amplified by previous downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, and Apple's stock being 12% off its highs.  The upcoming earnings report is a major wildcard.  While the $126 billion revenue expectation is positive, a miss could trigger further downward pressure. Considering the conflicting signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's short-term prospects.  I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall due to the prevailing negative market sentiment and the risk associated with the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to concerns over competition in the AI space sparked by DeepSeek's developments. This has led to pre-market declines across major tech stocks, with Nvidia down 11% and others like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla down around 5% or more.

The analyst cites a weak macro environment and the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features as reasons for the lowered iPhone units estimate. Despite this, the analyst remains optimistic about Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Additionally, the article highlights the competitive landscape in AI, with developments from DeepSeek causing concerns in the tech sector. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly higher due to Apple's AI advancements and the analyst's continued confidence in the company's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling and others suggesting a more neutral or slightly positive outlook, I have taken a balanced approach. The overall trend from previous predictions suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the immediate market reaction to the DeepSeek news and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings reports. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown declining estimates for future fiscal years and concerns over China and AI strategy have caused a drop in share price. On the other hand, there are optimistic views suggesting that these concerns may be overblown, and Apple could announce a local AI partner soon. The upcoming earnings report is expected to provide clarity. The various predictions from different models suggest a range of opinions, but most lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to current market sentiment and recent negative trends.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This broader market reaction is compounded by the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, adding uncertainty. While there are some positive factors regarding Apple's iPhone demand and potential AI advancements, the immediate market reaction seems more influenced by the overall tech sell-off. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on a temporary and unusual situation: iPhones with TikTok installed selling for exorbitant prices due to a ban. While this highlights TikTok's popularity, it's a niche market and unlikely to significantly impact Apple's overall revenue or long-term stock performance. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is evolving. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a fall due to broader tech sector concerns and others seeing potential for a rise. Considering the limited impact of this specific news on Apple's core business, I believe the stock price is more likely to remain stable or experience a slight rise due to the positive buzz, but the effect will be minimal. The fact that the ban was lifted relatively quickly diminishes the long-term impact. The high prices are driven by desperation and scarcity, not a fundamental shift in Apple's value.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include increased iPhone build estimates driven by strong Chinese demand and the potential for improved on-device AI due to cheaper AI model development.  Apple's outperformance relative to other tech giants facing AI cost deflation concerns is also a positive sign. However, counterbalancing these are persistent concerns about iPhone sales, reflected in recent downgrades, and the stock trading 12% below recent highs. The upcoming earnings report is a major uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  While the positive iPhone sales news and relative strength are bullish, the broader tech sell-off and lingering sales concerns suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. The DeepSeek news, while potentially beneficial to Apple long-term, is currently contributing to negative market sentiment.  Considering the balance of these factors, and the consensus leaning towards a fall in previous rounds, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc.
