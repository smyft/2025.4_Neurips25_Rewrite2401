(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite recent share sales, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong market position and capital-return program. The mention of Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire stock suggests a broader confidence in the market, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the recent share sales may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) and its relationship with Apple (AAPL). While Apple's earnings report on January 30th is mentioned, the article suggests that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by Apple's results. The historical data provided shows a moderate correlation between the two stocks, but past instances of strong Apple earnings reports did not lead to substantial gains for Berkshire Hathaway. Furthermore, the article points out that Berkshire Hathaway's valuation is currently high, and the company has not been buying back its own shares, suggesting that even Warren Buffett may not see it as a particularly attractive investment at the moment. The article concludes that there's no compelling reason to rush into buying Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple's earnings report. Therefore, the news is slightly negative for Berkshire Hathaway, and neutral for Apple. Since the article is about Berkshire Hathaway, the prediction is about Berkshire Hathaway.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban and subsequent reinstatement of the app. While the high prices fetched for these phones on eBay highlight the strong user engagement with TikTok, this event is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The issue is isolated to a short-lived situation and doesn't reflect on Apple's core business performance or future prospects.  The exorbitant prices are driven by scarcity and speculation, not by any fundamental change in Apple's market position or product demand.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall due to this news is very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. Apple's involvement in AI is a positive signal, as the company is known for its innovative technologies and strong market position. While the news itself is neutral, it highlights Apple's engagement with AI, which could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. However, without specific financial data or product announcements, the impact is likely to be modest.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and an analyst's opinion that AI is not a strong enough driver to take Apple to the next level. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to a negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's high valuation and lack of promising growth prospects, such as the iPhone 16 and Vision Pro, may lead to a wait-and-see approach from investors. Overall, the analyst's comments and the company's current challenges suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The article mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now only up 15.4% over the last year. Additionally, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4, or Sell, and a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article also notes that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and one of the four pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, which could indicate a potential for long-term growth. Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to Apple's strong brand and market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses whether to buy Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) stock before Apple's (AAPL) earnings report. It highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio, but historical data suggests that Apple's earnings don't strongly influence Berkshire's stock price. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is currently high, and the company isn't buying back shares, suggesting Buffett doesn't see it as particularly attractive. While the article concludes that Berkshire is a good long-term investment, it doesn't recommend rushing to buy it before Apple's earnings. Considering the mixed signals and the historical data, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the article's focus on Berkshire Hathaway and the limited direct impact on Apple, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a more neutral outlook for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices on eBay is a short-term, anecdotal event driven by a temporary TikTok ban and subsequent reinstatement.  This event is unlikely to have a significant or lasting impact on Apple's stock price. The high prices are a result of artificial scarcity and speculation, not a reflection of increased demand for Apple products or a fundamental shift in Apple's business.  While the event highlights the popularity of TikTok and its user base, it does not translate into a positive or negative indicator for Apple's long-term financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most agree that the impact of this news is minimal. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement (either up or down) due to this specific news is very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. Apple's engagement with AI is highlighted, which could be seen as a positive signal given the company's reputation for innovation. However, without specific financial data or product announcements, the impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, with some models (like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) leaning slightly positive, while others (like meta-llama/llama-4-scout) are more negative due to skepticism about AI's impact on Apple's growth. Balancing these perspectives, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses an analyst's skepticism about AI being a strong enough driver for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to a negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The article mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now only up 15.4% over the last year.

These updates are expected to improve developer experience, attract more developers, and enhance user experience, all of which positively affect Apple's competitive position in the app ecosystem. This positive development aligns with the recent positive sentiments noted in the previous predictions, where models predicted a higher probability of stock price rise despite varied reasoning. Considering the latest news, along with the previously noted bullish sentiments, it supports a higher probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

While Apple's performance is relevant to Berkshire due to its significant holding, the historical data suggests a weak correlation between Apple's earnings and Berkshire's stock price. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is high and Buffett isn't buying back shares, indicating a lack of immediate upside. The previous round of predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the article's focus on Berkshire Hathaway and the limited direct impact on Apple, I'm predicting the stock price movement for Apple. Given the mixed signals and the historical data, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a more neutral outlook for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices is a short-term, anecdotal event driven by a temporary TikTok ban and subsequent reinstatement. This event is highly unlikely to have a significant or lasting impact on Apple's stock price. The high prices are a result of artificial scarcity and speculation, not a reflection of increased demand for Apple products or a fundamental shift in Apple's business.  While the event highlights the popularity of TikTok and its user base, it does not translate into a positive or negative indicator for Apple's long-term financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most agree that the impact of this news is minimal.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement (either up or down) due to this specific news is extremely low.  The probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outcome, reflecting the lack of any substantial impact on Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls.

The event is a short-term anomaly driven by artificial scarcity and speculation, not by any fundamental change in Apple's business or product demand. While it highlights TikTok's popularity, it doesn't reflect on Apple's core strengths or weaknesses.
