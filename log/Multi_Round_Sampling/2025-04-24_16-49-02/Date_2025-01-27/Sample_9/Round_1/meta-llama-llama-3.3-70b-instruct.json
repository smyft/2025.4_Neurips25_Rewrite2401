Red Cat Holdings, Inc. RCAT\n\nRed Cat Holdings is a small cap company with a market cap of $701 million which makes drone technology for military, government, and commercial operations.\n\nShares of Red Cat Holdings are down 41% year-to-date, but the shares have soared 1003% over the last year. It's a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) but Zacks only has one earnings estimate.\n\nShould you take a chance on Red Cat Holdings?\n\n2. Barrick Gold Corp. GOLD\n\nBarrick Gold is a large cap global gold miner. Tracey talked about the gold trade, specifically with the miners, in a 2024 podcast because the price of gold was hitting new highs.\n\nShares of Barrick Gold are up 2.3% year-to-date but have only gained 1.5% over the last year. It's cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.7. 2025 earnings are expected to rise 30.3%.\n\nBarrick Gold is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nShould a gold miner, like Barrick Gold, be on your short list?\n\n3.

But shares of Apple have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now \"only\" up 15.4% over the last year.\n\nBut even though the shares have weakened, Apple is not cheap.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite recent share sales, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong market position and capital-return program. The mention of Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire stock suggests a broader confidence in the market, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the recent share sales may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) and its relationship with Apple (AAPL). While Apple's earnings report on January 30th is mentioned, the article suggests that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by Apple's results. The historical data provided shows a moderate correlation between the two stocks, but past instances of strong Apple earnings reports did not lead to substantial gains for Berkshire Hathaway. Furthermore, the article points out that Berkshire Hathaway's valuation is currently high, and the company has not been buying back its own shares, suggesting that even Warren Buffett may not see it as a particularly attractive investment at the moment. The article concludes that there's no compelling reason to rush into buying Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple's earnings report. Therefore, the news is slightly negative for Berkshire Hathaway, and neutral for Apple. Since the article is about Berkshire Hathaway, the prediction is about Berkshire Hathaway.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban and subsequent reinstatement of the app. While the high prices fetched for these phones on eBay highlight the strong user engagement with TikTok, this event is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The issue is isolated to a short-lived situation and doesn't reflect on Apple's core business performance or future prospects.  The exorbitant prices are driven by scarcity and speculation, not by any fundamental change in Apple's market position or product demand.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall due to this news is very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. Apple's involvement in AI is a positive signal, as the company is known for its innovative technologies and strong market position. While the news itself is neutral, it highlights Apple's engagement with AI, which could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. However, without specific financial data or product announcements, the impact is likely to be modest.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and an analyst's opinion that AI is not a strong enough driver to take Apple to the next level. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to a negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's high valuation and lack of promising growth prospects, such as the iPhone 16 and Vision Pro, may lead to a wait-and-see approach from investors. Overall, the analyst's comments and the company's current challenges suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The article mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now only up 15.4% over the last year. Additionally, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4, or Sell, and a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article also notes that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and one of the four pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, which could indicate a potential for long-term growth. Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to Apple's strong brand and market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
