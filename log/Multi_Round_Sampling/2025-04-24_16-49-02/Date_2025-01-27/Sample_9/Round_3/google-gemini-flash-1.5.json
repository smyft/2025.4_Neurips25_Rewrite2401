(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite recent share sales, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong market position and capital-return program. The mention of Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire stock suggests a broader confidence in the market, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the recent share sales may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) and its relationship with Apple (AAPL). While Apple's earnings report on January 30th is mentioned, the article suggests that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by Apple's results. The historical data provided shows a moderate correlation between the two stocks, but past instances of strong Apple earnings reports did not lead to substantial gains for Berkshire Hathaway. Furthermore, the article points out that Berkshire Hathaway's valuation is currently high, and the company has not been buying back its own shares, suggesting that even Warren Buffett may not see it as a particularly attractive investment at the moment. The article concludes that there's no compelling reason to rush into buying Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple's earnings report. Therefore, the news is slightly negative for Berkshire Hathaway, and neutral for Apple. Since the article is about Berkshire Hathaway, the prediction is about Berkshire Hathaway.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban and subsequent reinstatement of the app. While the high prices fetched for these phones on eBay highlight the strong user engagement with TikTok, this event is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The issue is isolated to a short-lived situation and doesn't reflect on Apple's core business performance or future prospects.  The exorbitant prices are driven by scarcity and speculation, not by any fundamental change in Apple's market position or product demand.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall due to this news is very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. Apple's involvement in AI is a positive signal, as the company is known for its innovative technologies and strong market position. While the news itself is neutral, it highlights Apple's engagement with AI, which could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. However, without specific financial data or product announcements, the impact is likely to be modest.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and an analyst's opinion that AI is not a strong enough driver to take Apple to the next level. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to a negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's high valuation and lack of promising growth prospects, such as the iPhone 16 and Vision Pro, may lead to a wait-and-see approach from investors. Overall, the analyst's comments and the company's current challenges suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The article mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now only up 15.4% over the last year. Additionally, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4, or Sell, and a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article also notes that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and one of the four pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, which could indicate a potential for long-term growth. Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to Apple's strong brand and market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

However, the recent share sales may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses whether to buy Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) stock before Apple's (AAPL) earnings report. It highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio, but historical data suggests that Apple's earnings don't strongly influence Berkshire's stock price. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is currently high, and the company isn't buying back shares, suggesting Buffett doesn't see it as particularly attractive. While the article concludes that Berkshire is a good long-term investment, it doesn't recommend rushing to buy it before Apple's earnings. Considering the mixed signals and the historical data, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the article's focus on Berkshire Hathaway and the limited direct impact on Apple, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a more neutral outlook for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices on eBay is a short-term, anecdotal event driven by a temporary TikTok ban and subsequent reinstatement.  This event is unlikely to have a significant or lasting impact on Apple's stock price. The high prices are a result of artificial scarcity and speculation, not a reflection of increased demand for Apple products or a fundamental shift in Apple's business.  While the event highlights the popularity of TikTok and its user base, it does not translate into a positive or negative indicator for Apple's long-term financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most agree that the impact of this news is minimal. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement (either up or down) due to this specific news is very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. Apple's engagement with AI is highlighted, which could be seen as a positive signal given the company's reputation for innovation. However, without specific financial data or product announcements, the impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, with some models (like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) leaning slightly positive, while others (like meta-llama/llama-4-scout) are more negative due to skepticism about AI's impact on Apple's growth. Balancing these perspectives, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses an analyst's skepticism about AI being a strong enough driver for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to a negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The article mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now only up 15.4% over the last year.

These updates are expected to improve developer experience, attract more developers, and enhance user experience, all of which positively affect Apple's competitive position in the app ecosystem. This positive development aligns with the recent positive sentiments noted in the previous predictions, where models predicted a higher probability of stock price rise despite varied reasoning. Considering the latest news, along with the previously noted bullish sentiments, it supports a higher probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

While Apple's performance is relevant to Berkshire due to its significant holding, the historical data suggests a weak correlation between Apple's earnings and Berkshire's stock price. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is high and Buffett isn't buying back shares, indicating a lack of immediate upside. The previous round of predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the article's focus on Berkshire Hathaway and the limited direct impact on Apple, I'm predicting the stock price movement for Apple. Given the mixed signals and the historical data, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a more neutral outlook for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices is a short-term, anecdotal event driven by a temporary TikTok ban and subsequent reinstatement.

The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most agree that the impact of this news is minimal.

The probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outcome, reflecting the lack of any substantial impact on Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls.
