(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\n\nguteksk7/Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite recent share sales, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong market position and capital-return program. The mention of Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire stock suggests a broader confidence in the market, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the recent share sales may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) and its relationship with Apple (AAPL). While Apple's earnings report on January 30th is mentioned, the article suggests that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by Apple's results. The historical data provided shows a moderate correlation between the two stocks, but past instances of strong Apple earnings reports did not lead to substantial gains for Berkshire Hathaway. Furthermore, the article points out that Berkshire Hathaway's valuation is currently high, and the company has not been buying back its own shares, suggesting that even Warren Buffett may not see it as a particularly attractive investment at the moment. The article concludes that there's no compelling reason to rush into buying Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple's earnings report. Therefore, the news is slightly negative for Berkshire Hathaway, and neutral for Apple. Since the article is about Berkshire Hathaway, the prediction is about Berkshire Hathaway.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban and subsequent reinstatement of the app. While the high prices fetched for these phones on eBay highlight the strong user engagement with TikTok, this event is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The issue is isolated to a short-lived situation and doesn't reflect on Apple's core business performance or future prospects.  The exorbitant prices are driven by scarcity and speculation, not by any fundamental change in Apple's market position or product demand.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall due to this news is very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. Apple's involvement in AI is a positive signal, as the company is known for its innovative technologies and strong market position. While the news itself is neutral, it highlights Apple's engagement with AI, which could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. However, without specific financial data or product announcements, the impact is likely to be modest.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and an analyst's opinion that AI is not a strong enough driver to take Apple to the next level. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to a negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's high valuation and lack of promising growth prospects, such as the iPhone 16 and Vision Pro, may lead to a wait-and-see approach from investors. Overall, the analyst's comments and the company's current challenges suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The article mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now only up 15.4% over the last year. Additionally, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4, or Sell, and a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is considered high. However, the article also notes that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and one of the four pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, which could indicate a potential for long-term growth. Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to Apple's strong brand and market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite recent share sales, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong market position and capital-return program. The mention of Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire stock suggests a broader confidence in the market, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the recent share sales may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses whether to buy Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) stock before Apple's (AAPL) earnings report. It highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio, but historical data suggests that Apple's earnings don't strongly influence Berkshire's stock price. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is currently high, and the company isn't buying back shares, suggesting Buffett doesn't see it as particularly attractive. While the article concludes that Berkshire is a good long-term investment, it doesn't recommend rushing to buy it before Apple's earnings. Considering the mixed signals and the historical data, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the article's focus on Berkshire Hathaway and the limited direct impact on Apple, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a more neutral outlook for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices on eBay is a short-term, anecdotal event driven by a temporary TikTok ban and subsequent reinstatement.  This event is unlikely to have a significant or lasting impact on Apple's stock price. The high prices are a result of artificial scarcity and speculation, not a reflection of increased demand for Apple products or a fundamental shift in Apple's business.  While the event highlights the popularity of TikTok and its user base, it does not translate into a positive or negative indicator for Apple's long-term financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most agree that the impact of this news is minimal. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement (either up or down) due to this specific news is very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. Apple's engagement with AI is highlighted, which could be seen as a positive signal given the company's reputation for innovation. However, without specific financial data or product announcements, the impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, with some models (like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) leaning slightly positive, while others (like meta-llama/llama-4-scout) are more negative due to skepticism about AI's impact on Apple's growth. Balancing these perspectives, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses an analyst's skepticism about AI being a strong enough driver for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to a negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The article mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now only up 15.4% over the last year. Additionally, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4, or Sell, and a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is considered high.

Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to Apple's strong brand and market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant enhancements to the App Store platform and robust adoption rates of iOS 18. These updates are expected to improve developer experience, attract more developers, and enhance user experience, all of which positively affect Apple's competitive position in the app ecosystem. This positive development aligns with the recent positive sentiments noted in the previous predictions, where models predicted a higher probability of stock price rise despite varied reasoning. Considering the latest news, along with the previously noted bullish sentiments, it supports a higher probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite recent share sales, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong market position and capital-return program. The mention of Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire stock suggests a broader confidence in the market, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the recent share sales may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Berkshire Hathaway and its potential movement based on Apple's earnings. While Apple's performance is relevant to Berkshire due to its significant holding, the historical data suggests a weak correlation between Apple's earnings and Berkshire's stock price. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is high and Buffett isn't buying back shares, indicating a lack of immediate upside. The previous round of predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the article's focus on Berkshire Hathaway and the limited direct impact on Apple, I'm predicting the stock price movement for Apple. Given the mixed signals and the historical data, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a more neutral outlook for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices is a short-term, anecdotal event driven by a temporary TikTok ban and subsequent reinstatement. This event is highly unlikely to have a significant or lasting impact on Apple's stock price. The high prices are a result of artificial scarcity and speculation, not a reflection of increased demand for Apple products or a fundamental shift in Apple's business.  While the event highlights the popularity of TikTok and its user base, it does not translate into a positive or negative indicator for Apple's long-term financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most agree that the impact of this news is minimal.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement (either up or down) due to this specific news is extremely low.  The probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outcome, reflecting the lack of any substantial impact on Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls.
