(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Overall, while there is potential for growth in AI, the immediate outlook appears mixed due to the lowered expectations for iPhone sales. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the risks of a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to show strong growth, and Mac sales are projected to rise, iPhone sales are likely to decline, a significant concern given its contribution to overall revenue.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal.  The article highlights concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds, particularly the potential iPhone sales decline and the negative Zacks rating, outweigh the positives. The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is not enough to offset the other negative factors. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights three key factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL): 1) The tech sector is tumbling due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI model, which could negatively impact investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. 2) Apple is set to report earnings this week, and market expectations and reactions to earnings reports can be volatile. 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting could influence broader market trends, with potential interest rate changes affecting tech stocks. Given the negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around earnings and Fed policy, there is a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Apple's shares have struggled lately, losing about 15% of their value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and that Apple may announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could potentially boost the stock price. Given the mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's earnings ESP is negative and they have a Zacks Rank #4, suggesting a sell rating. They have no recent earnings estimate revisions and have underperformed the industry in the past three months. While they have a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the guidance provided on the last earnings call was weak, expecting low to mid-single digit sales growth.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
