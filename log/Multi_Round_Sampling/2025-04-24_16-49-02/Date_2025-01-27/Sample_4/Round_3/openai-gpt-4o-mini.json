(AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Overall, while there is potential for growth in AI, the immediate outlook appears mixed due to the lowered expectations for iPhone sales. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the risks of a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to show strong growth, and Mac sales are projected to rise, iPhone sales are likely to decline, a significant concern given its contribution to overall revenue.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal.  The article highlights concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds, particularly the potential iPhone sales decline and the negative Zacks rating, outweigh the positives. The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is not enough to offset the other negative factors. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights three key factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL): 1) The tech sector is tumbling due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI model, which could negatively impact investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. 2) Apple is set to report earnings this week, and market expectations and reactions to earnings reports can be volatile. 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting could influence broader market trends, with potential interest rate changes affecting tech stocks. Given the negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around earnings and Fed policy, there is a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Apple's shares have struggled lately, losing about 15% of their value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and that Apple may announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could potentially boost the stock price. Given the mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's earnings ESP is negative and they have a Zacks Rank #4, suggesting a sell rating. They have no recent earnings estimate revisions and have underperformed the industry in the past three months. While they have a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the guidance provided on the last earnings call was weak, expecting low to mid-single digit sales growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. The mixed outlook from analysts, with some predicting a decline in iPhone sales and others noting the potential of AI investments, suggests a cautious sentiment. Given the competitive landscape, particularly with advancements from Chinese AI companies, and the upcoming earnings report, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of potential growth tempered by immediate risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking (6th) on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. While this is positive, the article also highlights concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns faster. The report also mentions potential risks like escalating US-China trade tensions. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a trend towards a more bearish outlook, with concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and stretched valuations. The current news, while positive on AI, doesn't fully offset these concerns. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to grow strongly and Mac sales are projected to rise, the anticipated decline in iPhone sales is a significant concern given its substantial contribution to overall revenue.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal.  Concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation further add to the negative sentiment. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds outweigh the positives. The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is insufficient to offset the other negative factors.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering all these factors, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledge the potential for positive surprises from the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the provided financial news and previous predictions indicates a predominantly negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to multiple factors: 1) The tech sector is under pressure from China's DeepSeek AI model, which may drag down AAPL along with other tech stocks. 2) Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' reporting earnings this week, and market expectations are volatile, with mixed signals from previous predictions (some citing weak iPhone sales, AI delays, and stretched valuations). 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting adds uncertainty to interest rate policy, which could further impact tech stocks. Given the bearish consensus in prior models (e.g., Zacks Rank #4, no positive earnings estimate revisions, and underperformance in the past three months) and the short-term headwinds, the probability of a stock price decline is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price movement. On the one hand, Apple's stock surged while Meta Platforms and other tech giants experienced a downturn, potentially due to its perceived advantage in more efficient and cost-effective AI models. The upgrade in iPhone build estimates by JPMorgan and the prospects of on-device AI for iPhones could positively influence investor sentiment. On the other hand, concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and the potential impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model on the industry could weigh on the stock price. Additionally, Apple's stock has recently faced downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, which could indicate a potential decline. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems slightly lower than the probability of a fall, but still within a relatively close range.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's shares have struggled lately, losing about 15% of their value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.

Considering the mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. The overall trend from previous predictions suggests a cautious approach, with some models indicating a higher probability of a fall due to concerns about iPhone sales, valuation, and competition in China. However, the potential for a positive earnings surprise and the long-term benefits of Apple's AI investments could support a rise in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises and is investing in AI, which could be positive in the long term. On the other hand, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a sell rating. Recent analyst actions and weak sales guidance suggest concerns about near-term performance. Given the mixed signals and the fact that the stock has underperformed the industry in the past three months, the overall sentiment leans towards caution.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, there are concerns regarding the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the weak macro environment, which may create short-term performance issues. The mixed outlook from analysts, with some predicting a decline in iPhone sales and others noting the potential of AI investments, suggests a cautious sentiment. Additionally, competition from Chinese AI developments and the upcoming earnings report add to the uncertainty. Overall, while there are positive aspects regarding AI investments, the immediate risks and mixed signals lead to a balanced view of potential growth tempered by risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking on JPMorgan's list. While positive, it also highlights concerns about high tech valuations and potential volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns faster. The report mentions potential risks like US-China trade tensions. Previous predictions show a bearish trend due to concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and stretched valuations. The current news, while positive on AI, doesn't fully offset these concerns. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, but not as bearish as some previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to grow strongly, and Mac sales are projected to rise, the anticipated decline in iPhone sales is a significant concern given its substantial contribution to overall revenue. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal. Concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation further add to the negative sentiment.

The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is insufficient to offset the other negative factors. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering all these factors, and the overall bearish sentiment reflected in the Zacks rating and analyst predictions, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledge the potential for positive surprises from the earnings report. The fact that the stock has underperformed the sector also weighs on the probability of a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). The tech sector is under pressure due to China's DeepSeek AI model, which could negatively impact AAPL. Additionally, Apple is set to report earnings this week, and market expectations are volatile, with concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and stretched valuations. The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting adds further uncertainty. Previous predictions lean towards a bearish outlook, with models citing weak iPhone sales, AI delays, and underperformance. However, Apple's strong track record in earnings surprises and long-term AI investments provide some positive counterbalance. Given the prevailing negative sentiment and short-term headwinds, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock surged while other tech giants experienced a downturn, potentially due to its perceived advantage in more efficient and cost-effective AI models. The upgrade in iPhone build estimates by JPMorgan and the prospects of on-device AI for iPhones could positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and the potential impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model on the industry could weigh on the stock price.

(AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises and is investing in AI, which could be positive in the long term. On the other hand, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a sell rating. Recent analyst actions and weak sales guidance suggest concerns about near-term performance. Previous predictions from various models generally lean towards a lower probability of a stock price rise, with some indicating higher probabilities of a price fall due to concerns about iPhone sales, valuation, and competition in China.
