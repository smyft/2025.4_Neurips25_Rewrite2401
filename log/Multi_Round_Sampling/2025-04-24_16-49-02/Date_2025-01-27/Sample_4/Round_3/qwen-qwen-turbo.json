(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 ETFs to Watch This Earnings Season\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Overall, while there is potential for growth in AI, the immediate outlook appears mixed due to the lowered expectations for iPhone sales. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the risks of a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to show strong growth, and Mac sales are projected to rise, iPhone sales are likely to decline, a significant concern given its contribution to overall revenue.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal.  The article highlights concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds, particularly the potential iPhone sales decline and the negative Zacks rating, outweigh the positives. The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is not enough to offset the other negative factors. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights three key factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL): 1) The tech sector is tumbling due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI model, which could negatively impact investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. 2) Apple is set to report earnings this week, and market expectations and reactions to earnings reports can be volatile. 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting could influence broader market trends, with potential interest rate changes affecting tech stocks. Given the negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around earnings and Fed policy, there is a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Apple's shares have struggled lately, losing about 15% of their value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and that Apple may announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could potentially boost the stock price. Given the mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's earnings ESP is negative and they have a Zacks Rank #4, suggesting a sell rating. They have no recent earnings estimate revisions and have underperformed the industry in the past three months. While they have a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the guidance provided on the last earnings call was weak, expecting low to mid-single digit sales growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. The mixed outlook from analysts, with some predicting a decline in iPhone sales and others noting the potential of AI investments, suggests a cautious sentiment. Given the competitive landscape, particularly with advancements from Chinese AI companies, and the upcoming earnings report, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of potential growth tempered by immediate risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking (6th) on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. While this is positive, the article also highlights concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns faster. The report also mentions potential risks like escalating US-China trade tensions. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a trend towards a more bearish outlook, with concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and stretched valuations. The current news, while positive on AI, doesn't fully offset these concerns. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to grow strongly and Mac sales are projected to rise, the anticipated decline in iPhone sales is a significant concern given its substantial contribution to overall revenue.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal.  Concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation further add to the negative sentiment. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds outweigh the positives. The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is insufficient to offset the other negative factors.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering all these factors, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledge the potential for positive surprises from the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the provided financial news and previous predictions indicates a predominantly negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to multiple factors: 1) The tech sector is under pressure from China's DeepSeek AI model, which may drag down AAPL along with other tech stocks. 2) Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' reporting earnings this week, and market expectations are volatile, with mixed signals from previous predictions (some citing weak iPhone sales, AI delays, and stretched valuations). 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting adds uncertainty to interest rate policy, which could further impact tech stocks. Given the bearish consensus in prior models (e.g., Zacks Rank #4, no positive earnings estimate revisions, and underperformance in the past three months) and the short-term headwinds, the probability of a stock price decline is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price movement. On the one hand, Apple's stock surged while Meta Platforms and other tech giants experienced a downturn, potentially due to its perceived advantage in more efficient and cost-effective AI models. The upgrade in iPhone build estimates by JPMorgan and the prospects of on-device AI for iPhones could positively influence investor sentiment. On the other hand, concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and the potential impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model on the industry could weigh on the stock price. Additionally, Apple's stock has recently faced downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, which could indicate a potential decline. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems slightly lower than the probability of a fall, but still within a relatively close range.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's shares have struggled lately, losing about 15% of their value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.

Considering the mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. The overall trend from previous predictions suggests a cautious approach, with some models indicating a higher probability of a fall due to concerns about iPhone sales, valuation, and competition in China. However, the potential for a positive earnings surprise and the long-term benefits of Apple's AI investments could support a rise in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises and is investing in AI, which could be positive in the long term. On the other hand, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a sell rating. Recent analyst actions and weak sales guidance suggest concerns about near-term performance. Given the mixed signals and the fact that the stock has underperformed the industry in the past three months, the overall sentiment leans towards caution.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, there are concerns regarding the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the weak macro environment, which may create short-term performance issues. The mixed outlook from analysts, with some predicting a decline in iPhone sales and others noting the potential of AI investments, suggests a cautious sentiment. Additionally, competition from Chinese AI developments and the upcoming earnings report add to the uncertainty. Overall, while there are positive aspects regarding AI investments, the immediate risks and mixed signals lead to a balanced view of potential growth tempered by risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking on JPMorgan's list. While positive, it also highlights concerns about high tech valuations and potential volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns faster. The report mentions potential risks like US-China trade tensions. Previous predictions show a bearish trend due to concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and stretched valuations. The current news, while positive on AI, doesn't fully offset these concerns. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, but not as bearish as some previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to grow strongly, and Mac sales are projected to rise, the anticipated decline in iPhone sales is a significant concern given its substantial contribution to overall revenue. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal. Concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation further add to the negative sentiment. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds outweigh the positives.  The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is insufficient to offset the other negative factors. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering all these factors, and the overall bearish sentiment reflected in the Zacks rating and analyst predictions, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledge the potential for positive surprises from the earnings report. The fact that the stock has underperformed the sector also weighs on the probability of a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). The tech sector is under pressure due to China's DeepSeek AI model, which could negatively impact AAPL. Additionally, Apple is set to report earnings this week, and market expectations are volatile, with concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and stretched valuations. The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting adds further uncertainty. Previous predictions lean towards a bearish outlook, with models citing weak iPhone sales, AI delays, and underperformance. However, Apple's strong track record in earnings surprises and long-term AI investments provide some positive counterbalance. Given the prevailing negative sentiment and short-term headwinds, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock surged while other tech giants experienced a downturn, potentially due to its perceived advantage in more efficient and cost-effective AI models. The upgrade in iPhone build estimates by JPMorgan and the prospects of on-device AI for iPhones could positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and the potential impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model on the industry could weigh on the stock price.

However, the potential for a positive earnings surprise and the long-term benefits of Apple's AI investments could support a rise in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises and is investing in AI, which could be positive in the long term. On the other hand, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a sell rating. Recent analyst actions and weak sales guidance suggest concerns about near-term performance. Previous predictions from various models generally lean towards a lower probability of a stock price rise, with some indicating higher probabilities of a price fall due to concerns about iPhone sales, valuation, and competition in China.
