A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Overall, while there is potential for growth in AI, the immediate outlook appears mixed due to the lowered expectations for iPhone sales. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the risks of a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to show strong growth, and Mac sales are projected to rise, iPhone sales are likely to decline, a significant concern given its contribution to overall revenue.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal.  The article highlights concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds, particularly the potential iPhone sales decline and the negative Zacks rating, outweigh the positives. The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is not enough to offset the other negative factors. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights three key factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL): 1) The tech sector is tumbling due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI model, which could negatively impact investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. 2) Apple is set to report earnings this week, and market expectations and reactions to earnings reports can be volatile. 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting could influence broader market trends, with potential interest rate changes affecting tech stocks. Given the negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around earnings and Fed policy, there is a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Apple's shares have struggled lately, losing about 15% of their value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and that Apple may announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could potentially boost the stock price. Given the mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's earnings ESP is negative and they have a Zacks Rank #4, suggesting a sell rating. They have no recent earnings estimate revisions and have underperformed the industry in the past three months. While they have a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the guidance provided on the last earnings call was weak, expecting low to mid-single digit sales growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. The mixed outlook from analysts, with some predicting a decline in iPhone sales and others noting the potential of AI investments, suggests a cautious sentiment. Given the competitive landscape, particularly with advancements from Chinese AI companies, and the upcoming earnings report, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of potential growth tempered by immediate risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking (6th) on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. While this is positive, the article also highlights concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns faster. The report also mentions potential risks like escalating US-China trade tensions. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a trend towards a more bearish outlook, with concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and stretched valuations. The current news, while positive on AI, doesn't fully offset these concerns. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to grow strongly and Mac sales are projected to rise, the anticipated decline in iPhone sales is a significant concern given its substantial contribution to overall revenue.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal.  Concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation further add to the negative sentiment. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds outweigh the positives. The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is insufficient to offset the other negative factors.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering all these factors, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledge the potential for positive surprises from the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the provided financial news and previous predictions indicates a predominantly negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to multiple factors: 1) The tech sector is under pressure from China's DeepSeek AI model, which may drag down AAPL along with other tech stocks. 2) Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' reporting earnings this week, and market expectations are volatile, with mixed signals from previous predictions (some citing weak iPhone sales, AI delays, and stretched valuations). 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting adds uncertainty to interest rate policy, which could further impact tech stocks. Given the bearish consensus in prior models (e.g., Zacks Rank #4, no positive earnings estimate revisions, and underperformance in the past three months) and the short-term headwinds, the probability of a stock price decline is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price movement. On the one hand, Apple's stock surged while Meta Platforms and other tech giants experienced a downturn, potentially due to its perceived advantage in more efficient and cost-effective AI models. The upgrade in iPhone build estimates by JPMorgan and the prospects of on-device AI for iPhones could positively influence investor sentiment. On the other hand, concerns about iPhone sales, competition in China, and the potential impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model on the industry could weigh on the stock price. Additionally, Apple's stock has recently faced downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, which could indicate a potential decline. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems slightly lower than the probability of a fall, but still within a relatively close range.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's shares have struggled lately, losing about 15% of their value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and that Apple may announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could potentially boost the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. The overall trend from previous predictions suggests a cautious approach, with some models indicating a higher probability of a fall due to concerns about iPhone sales, valuation, and competition in China. However, the potential for a positive earnings surprise and the long-term benefits of Apple's AI investments could support a rise in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises and is investing in AI, which could be positive in the long term. On the other hand, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a sell rating. Recent analyst actions and weak sales guidance suggest concerns about near-term performance. Given the mixed signals and the fact that the stock has underperformed the industry in the past three months, the overall sentiment leans towards caution.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
