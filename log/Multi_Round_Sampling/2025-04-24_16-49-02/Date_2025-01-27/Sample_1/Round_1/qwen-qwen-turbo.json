Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\nNews Content: Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\r\n\r\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\r\n\r\nApple expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAAPL\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple\u2019s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion. \r\n\r\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple\u2019s installed base has been a concern.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL\u2019s Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\r\n\r\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle. \r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple\u2019s Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple\u2019s Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter. \r\n\r\nApple\u2019s estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo\u2019s growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies DELL and HP HPQ saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies\u2019 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple\u2019s market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\r\n\r\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner\u2019s list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 27.5%.\n\nApple Stock\u2019s PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 27.54X.\n\nPrice/Earnings (F12M)Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL\u2019s Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul. \r\n\r\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple\u2019s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now. \r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The upcoming Q1 earnings report for Apple Inc. shows mixed signals. While the company expects revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, the iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly, which is a significant concern given that iPhone sales are a major revenue driver. However, the Services segment is expected to grow robustly, which could offset some of the iPhone weakness. The stock has underperformed its sector, and the current valuation appears stretched. Additionally, the Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests a bearish outlook. Overall, the combination of potential revenue growth in Services and concerns over iPhone sales leads to a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, there's a downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings season for the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple.  While the overall outlook for the group is positive (projected 20.9% earnings growth), Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is -1.51%, indicating a slightly lower probability of beating earnings expectations than the consensus.  Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth.  The recent underperformance of the stock (-4.6% over the past three months) and the Jefferies downgrade to underperform also weigh negatively. While Apple's strong track record of positive earnings surprises (5.05% average) offers some counterbalance, the weak guidance and negative sentiment suggest a higher probability of a price fall or at best, stagnation, in the short term following the earnings announcement. The AI features are still in early stages and haven't significantly impacted sales yet.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, with Apple (AAPL) scheduled to report on Jan. 30. Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower chance of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies further weigh on the outlook. However, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters), which could provide some support. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of Zacks Earnings Preview, along with other major companies. The content highlights that Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential for announcing a local AI partner. Given the mixed but generally cautious outlook, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the frenzy caused by the TikTok ban in the U.S., leading to a surge in demand for iPhones with the app pre-installed. While this may seem like a positive development for Apple, it's essential to consider the broader context. The ban is a result of a geopolitical dispute, and its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited. The article highlights the desperation of TikTok users, which may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales. However, this demand is unlikely to be sustainable, and the overall impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including the resolution of the TikTok ban, the company's overall sales performance, and the competitive landscape. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals for Apple's stock performance. While the company is expected to meet revenue and earnings expectations, there are concerns around iPhone sales, which could impact investor sentiment. The AI push shows potential for future growth but is currently delayed, adding uncertainty. The valuation is also considered high, which might limit upside potential.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
