(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 ETFs to Watch This Earnings Season\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The upcoming Q1 earnings report for Apple Inc. shows mixed signals. While the company expects revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, the iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly, which is a significant concern given that iPhone sales are a major revenue driver. However, the Services segment is expected to grow robustly, which could offset some of the iPhone weakness. The stock has underperformed its sector, and the current valuation appears stretched. Additionally, the Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests a bearish outlook. Overall, the combination of potential revenue growth in Services and concerns over iPhone sales leads to a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, there's a downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings season for the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple.  While the overall outlook for the group is positive (projected 20.9% earnings growth), Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is -1.51%, indicating a slightly lower probability of beating earnings expectations than the consensus.  Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth.  The recent underperformance of the stock (-4.6% over the past three months) and the Jefferies downgrade to underperform also weigh negatively. While Apple's strong track record of positive earnings surprises (5.05% average) offers some counterbalance, the weak guidance and negative sentiment suggest a higher probability of a price fall or at best, stagnation, in the short term following the earnings announcement. The AI features are still in early stages and haven't significantly impacted sales yet.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, with Apple (AAPL) scheduled to report on Jan. 30. Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower chance of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies further weigh on the outlook. However, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters), which could provide some support. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of Zacks Earnings Preview, along with other major companies. The content highlights that Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential for announcing a local AI partner. Given the mixed but generally cautious outlook, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the frenzy caused by the TikTok ban in the U.S., leading to a surge in demand for iPhones with the app pre-installed. While this may seem like a positive development for Apple, it's essential to consider the broader context. The ban is a result of a geopolitical dispute, and its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited. The article highlights the desperation of TikTok users, which may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales. However, this demand is unlikely to be sustainable, and the overall impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including the resolution of the TikTok ban, the company's overall sales performance, and the competitive landscape. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals for Apple's stock performance. While the company is expected to meet revenue and earnings expectations, there are concerns around iPhone sales, which could impact investor sentiment. The AI push shows potential for future growth but is currently delayed, adding uncertainty. The valuation is also considered high, which might limit upside potential.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The upcoming Q1 earnings report for Apple Inc. presents a mixed outlook. While the company anticipates revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits and a solid performance from its Services segment, concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates a bearish outlook, and the lack of earnings estimate revisions over the past month suggests limited positive momentum. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase, the downward revision in EPS estimates and the slight decline in iPhone revenue are concerning. The strong growth in Services is a positive, but the mixed geographic revenue picture adds uncertainty. The stock's recent underperformance and Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) further suggest potential downside. Considering these factors, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a fall, reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' is positive, Apple's specific situation shows some weaknesses.  The negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), weak sales guidance ('low to mid-single digit' growth), and a recent downgrade from Jefferies to underperform all point towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The underperformance of the stock (-4.6% over the past three months) further reinforces this bearish sentiment.  While Apple has a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the current weak guidance and negative market sentiment outweigh this positive factor. The AI features are still in their early stages and haven't yet significantly boosted sales.  Considering the previous predictions, which largely lean towards a price fall, and the current information, a price fall is more likely in the short term following the earnings announcement. However, the probability is not overwhelmingly high due to Apple's historical performance and the potential for positive surprises.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news reveals several key points. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to show strong earnings growth overall. However, Apple specifically has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower chance of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, declining 4.6% over the past three months. Weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies further dampen the outlook. While Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters), the current negative signals outweigh the positive ones. The AI features are still in early stages and have not yet significantly boosted sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally cautious outlook for Apple's stock performance. Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The stock has underperformed, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas. While Apple bulls see the downbeat sentiment as overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential for announcing a local AI partner, bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 has been declining, from $7.49 three months back to $7.40 currently, indicating a negative sentiment. Additionally, the stock has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall seems higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with the app pre-installed may have a short-term positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the broader context and the mixed signals from previous predictions, the overall impact is likely to be limited. The desperation of TikTok users may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales, but this demand is unlikely to be sustainable. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for the ban to be resolved, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but still relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news provides mixed signals regarding Apple's earnings. While there is projected revenue growth and a steady Services segment, the primary concern is the slight decline expected in iPhone sales and the company's underperformance relative to its sector. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation further supports a cautious outlook. The previous predictions from various models also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to these factors. Given the cautious sentiment and mixed signals, the estimated probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected revenue growth in the Services segment, concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates a bearish outlook, and the lack of earnings estimate revisions suggests limited positive momentum. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to these factors. Overall, the combination of potential revenue growth in Services and significant concerns over iPhone sales leads to a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, the downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, and the trend of previous predictions leaning towards a price decrease, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, the positive growth in EPS and overall revenue provides some support, preventing a drastically low probability of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings announcement presents a mixed outlook. While the overall 'Magnificent Seven' group shows strong projected growth, Apple's situation is more nuanced.  Weak sales guidance, a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), and recent underperformance (-4.6% in three months) suggest a higher likelihood of a price fall.  The lack of recent earnings estimate revisions further indicates a lack of positive momentum.  While Apple historically delivers positive earnings surprises, the current negative sentiment and weak guidance outweigh this positive factor.  The AI features are still nascent and haven't significantly impacted sales yet.  The consensus from previous prediction models also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering all these factors, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise, although not overwhelmingly so given Apple's historical resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed but generally cautious outlook.

While the surge in demand for these iPhones may lead to a temporary increase in sales, the overall impact is likely to be limited and short-term. The desperation of TikTok users and the company's strong brand loyalty are positive factors, but the uncertainty surrounding the ban's resolution and the potential for this demand to be unsustainable weigh negatively. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which largely lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to concerns over iPhone sales, valuation, and geopolitical disputes, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautious sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook with both positive and negative factors. On the positive side, the company is expected to see revenue and EPS growth, with strong performance anticipated in the Services segment. However, there are concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation, compounded by a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), which indicates bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from various models consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to the mixed signals and recent underperformance. While there is potential for positive surprises, the current cautious outlook and bearish sentiment make the probability of a stock price fall seem higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
