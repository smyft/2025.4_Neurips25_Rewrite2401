(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The upcoming Q1 earnings report for Apple Inc. shows mixed signals. While the company expects revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, the iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly, which is a significant concern given that iPhone sales are a major revenue driver. However, the Services segment is expected to grow robustly, which could offset some of the iPhone weakness. The stock has underperformed its sector, and the current valuation appears stretched. Additionally, the Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests a bearish outlook. Overall, the combination of potential revenue growth in Services and concerns over iPhone sales leads to a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, there's a downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings season for the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple.  While the overall outlook for the group is positive (projected 20.9% earnings growth), Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is -1.51%, indicating a slightly lower probability of beating earnings expectations than the consensus.  Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth.  The recent underperformance of the stock (-4.6% over the past three months) and the Jefferies downgrade to underperform also weigh negatively. While Apple's strong track record of positive earnings surprises (5.05% average) offers some counterbalance, the weak guidance and negative sentiment suggest a higher probability of a price fall or at best, stagnation, in the short term following the earnings announcement. The AI features are still in early stages and haven't significantly impacted sales yet.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, with Apple (AAPL) scheduled to report on Jan. 30. Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower chance of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies further weigh on the outlook. However, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters), which could provide some support. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of Zacks Earnings Preview, along with other major companies. The content highlights that Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential for announcing a local AI partner. Given the mixed but generally cautious outlook, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the frenzy caused by the TikTok ban in the U.S., leading to a surge in demand for iPhones with the app pre-installed. While this may seem like a positive development for Apple, it's essential to consider the broader context. The ban is a result of a geopolitical dispute, and its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited. The article highlights the desperation of TikTok users, which may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales. However, this demand is unlikely to be sustainable, and the overall impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including the resolution of the TikTok ban, the company's overall sales performance, and the competitive landscape. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals for Apple's stock performance. While the company is expected to meet revenue and earnings expectations, there are concerns around iPhone sales, which could impact investor sentiment. The AI push shows potential for future growth but is currently delayed, adding uncertainty. The valuation is also considered high, which might limit upside potential.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The upcoming Q1 earnings report for Apple Inc. presents a mixed outlook. While the company anticipates revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits and a solid performance from its Services segment, concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates a bearish outlook, and the lack of earnings estimate revisions over the past month suggests limited positive momentum. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase, the downward revision in EPS estimates and the slight decline in iPhone revenue are concerning. The strong growth in Services is a positive, but the mixed geographic revenue picture adds uncertainty. The stock's recent underperformance and Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) further suggest potential downside. Considering these factors, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a fall, reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' is positive, Apple's specific situation shows some weaknesses.  The negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), weak sales guidance ('low to mid-single digit' growth), and a recent downgrade from Jefferies to underperform all point towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The underperformance of the stock (-4.6% over the past three months) further reinforces this bearish sentiment.  While Apple has a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the current weak guidance and negative market sentiment outweigh this positive factor. The AI features are still in their early stages and haven't yet significantly boosted sales.  Considering the previous predictions, which largely lean towards a price fall, and the current information, a price fall is more likely in the short term following the earnings announcement. However, the probability is not overwhelmingly high due to Apple's historical performance and the potential for positive surprises.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news reveals several key points. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to show strong earnings growth overall. However, Apple specifically has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower chance of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, declining 4.6% over the past three months. Weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies further dampen the outlook. While Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters), the current negative signals outweigh the positive ones. The AI features are still in early stages and have not yet significantly boosted sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally cautious outlook for Apple's stock performance. Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The stock has underperformed, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas. While Apple bulls see the downbeat sentiment as overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential for announcing a local AI partner, bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 has been declining, from $7.49 three months back to $7.40 currently, indicating a negative sentiment. Additionally, the stock has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall seems higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with the app pre-installed may have a short-term positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the broader context and the mixed signals from previous predictions, the overall impact is likely to be limited. The desperation of TikTok users may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales, but this demand is unlikely to be sustainable. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for the ban to be resolved, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but still relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news provides mixed signals regarding Apple's earnings. While there is projected revenue growth and a steady Services segment, the primary concern is the slight decline expected in iPhone sales and the company's underperformance relative to its sector. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation further supports a cautious outlook. The previous predictions from various models also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to these factors. Given the cautious sentiment and mixed signals, the estimated probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected revenue growth in the Services segment, concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates a bearish outlook, and the lack of earnings estimate revisions suggests limited positive momentum. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to these factors. Overall, the combination of potential revenue growth in Services and significant concerns over iPhone sales leads to a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, the downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, and the trend of previous predictions leaning towards a price decrease, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, the positive growth in EPS and overall revenue provides some support, preventing a drastically low probability of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings announcement presents a mixed outlook. While the overall 'Magnificent Seven' group shows strong projected growth, Apple's situation is more nuanced.  Weak sales guidance, a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), and recent underperformance (-4.6% in three months) suggest a higher likelihood of a price fall.  The lack of recent earnings estimate revisions further indicates a lack of positive momentum.  While Apple historically delivers positive earnings surprises, the current negative sentiment and weak guidance outweigh this positive factor.  The AI features are still nascent and haven't significantly impacted sales yet.  The consensus from previous prediction models also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering all these factors, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise, although not overwhelmingly so given Apple's historical resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.

While the surge in demand for these iPhones may lead to a temporary increase in sales, the overall impact is likely to be limited and short-term. The desperation of TikTok users and the company's strong brand loyalty are positive factors, but the uncertainty surrounding the ban's resolution and the potential for this demand to be unsustainable weigh negatively.

(AAPL) presents a mixed outlook with both positive and negative factors. On the positive side, the company is expected to see revenue and EPS growth, with strong performance anticipated in the Services segment. However, there are concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation, compounded by a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), which indicates bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from various models consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to the mixed signals and recent underperformance. While there is potential for positive surprises, the current cautious outlook and bearish sentiment make the probability of a stock price fall seem higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
