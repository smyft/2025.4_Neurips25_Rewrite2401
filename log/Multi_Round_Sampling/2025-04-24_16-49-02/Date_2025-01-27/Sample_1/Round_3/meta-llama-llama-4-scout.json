(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The upcoming Q1 earnings report for Apple Inc. shows mixed signals. While the company expects revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, the iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly, which is a significant concern given that iPhone sales are a major revenue driver. However, the Services segment is expected to grow robustly, which could offset some of the iPhone weakness. The stock has underperformed its sector, and the current valuation appears stretched. Additionally, the Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests a bearish outlook. Overall, the combination of potential revenue growth in Services and concerns over iPhone sales leads to a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, there's a downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings season for the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple.  While the overall outlook for the group is positive (projected 20.9% earnings growth), Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is -1.51%, indicating a slightly lower probability of beating earnings expectations than the consensus.  Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth.  The recent underperformance of the stock (-4.6% over the past three months) and the Jefferies downgrade to underperform also weigh negatively. While Apple's strong track record of positive earnings surprises (5.05% average) offers some counterbalance, the weak guidance and negative sentiment suggest a higher probability of a price fall or at best, stagnation, in the short term following the earnings announcement. The AI features are still in early stages and haven't significantly impacted sales yet.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, with Apple (AAPL) scheduled to report on Jan. 30. Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower chance of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies further weigh on the outlook. However, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters), which could provide some support. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of Zacks Earnings Preview, along with other major companies. The content highlights that Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential for announcing a local AI partner. Given the mixed but generally cautious outlook, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the frenzy caused by the TikTok ban in the U.S., leading to a surge in demand for iPhones with the app pre-installed. While this may seem like a positive development for Apple, it's essential to consider the broader context. The ban is a result of a geopolitical dispute, and its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited. The article highlights the desperation of TikTok users, which may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales. However, this demand is unlikely to be sustainable, and the overall impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including the resolution of the TikTok ban, the company's overall sales performance, and the competitive landscape. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals for Apple's stock performance. While the company is expected to meet revenue and earnings expectations, there are concerns around iPhone sales, which could impact investor sentiment. The AI push shows potential for future growth but is currently delayed, adding uncertainty. The valuation is also considered high, which might limit upside potential.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The upcoming Q1 earnings report for Apple Inc. presents a mixed outlook. While the company anticipates revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits and a solid performance from its Services segment, concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates a bearish outlook, and the lack of earnings estimate revisions over the past month suggests limited positive momentum. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase, the downward revision in EPS estimates and the slight decline in iPhone revenue are concerning. The strong growth in Services is a positive, but the mixed geographic revenue picture adds uncertainty. The stock's recent underperformance and Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) further suggest potential downside. Considering these factors, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a fall, reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' is positive, Apple's specific situation shows some weaknesses.  The negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), weak sales guidance ('low to mid-single digit' growth), and a recent downgrade from Jefferies to underperform all point towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The underperformance of the stock (-4.6% over the past three months) further reinforces this bearish sentiment.  While Apple has a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the current weak guidance and negative market sentiment outweigh this positive factor. The AI features are still in their early stages and haven't yet significantly boosted sales.  Considering the previous predictions, which largely lean towards a price fall, and the current information, a price fall is more likely in the short term following the earnings announcement. However, the probability is not overwhelmingly high due to Apple's historical performance and the potential for positive surprises.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news reveals several key points. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to show strong earnings growth overall. However, Apple specifically has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower chance of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, declining 4.6% over the past three months. Weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies further dampen the outlook. While Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters), the current negative signals outweigh the positive ones. The AI features are still in early stages and have not yet significantly boosted sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally cautious outlook for Apple's stock performance. Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The stock has underperformed, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas. While Apple bulls see the downbeat sentiment as overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential for announcing a local AI partner, bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 has been declining, from $7.49 three months back to $7.40 currently, indicating a negative sentiment. Additionally, the stock has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall seems higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with the app pre-installed may have a short-term positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the broader context and the mixed signals from previous predictions, the overall impact is likely to be limited. The desperation of TikTok users may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales, but this demand is unlikely to be sustainable. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for the ban to be resolved, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but still relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news provides mixed signals regarding Apple's earnings. While there is projected revenue growth and a steady Services segment, the primary concern is the slight decline expected in iPhone sales and the company's underperformance relative to its sector. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation further supports a cautious outlook. The previous predictions from various models also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to these factors. Given the cautious sentiment and mixed signals, the estimated probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected revenue growth in the Services segment, concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates a bearish outlook, and the lack of earnings estimate revisions suggests limited positive momentum. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to these factors. Overall, the combination of potential revenue growth in Services and significant concerns over iPhone sales leads to a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, the downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, and the trend of previous predictions leaning towards a price decrease, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, the positive growth in EPS and overall revenue provides some support, preventing a drastically low probability of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings announcement presents a mixed outlook. While the overall 'Magnificent Seven' group shows strong projected growth, Apple's situation is more nuanced.  Weak sales guidance, a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), and recent underperformance (-4.6% in three months) suggest a higher likelihood of a price fall.  The lack of recent earnings estimate revisions further indicates a lack of positive momentum.  While Apple historically delivers positive earnings surprises, the current negative sentiment and weak guidance outweigh this positive factor.  The AI features are still nascent and haven't significantly impacted sales yet.  The consensus from previous prediction models also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering all these factors, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise, although not overwhelmingly so given Apple's historical resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news and previous predictions reveals a mixed but generally cautious outlook. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to show strong earnings growth overall. However, Apple specifically has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower chance of an earnings beat.

Given these factors and the previous predictions leaning towards a higher probability of a fall, the stock price is more likely to fall than rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally cautious outlook for Apple's stock performance.

Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall seems higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The recent news about the TikTok ban sparking a frenzy for iPhones with the app installed, with some selling for thousands of dollars on eBay, presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock performance. While the surge in demand for these iPhones may lead to a temporary increase in sales, the overall impact is likely to be limited and short-term. The desperation of TikTok users and the company's strong brand loyalty are positive factors, but the uncertainty surrounding the ban's resolution and the potential for this demand to be unsustainable weigh negatively. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which largely lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to concerns over iPhone sales, valuation, and geopolitical disputes, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautious sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook with both positive and negative factors. On the positive side, the company is expected to see revenue and EPS growth, with strong performance anticipated in the Services segment. However, there are concerns about declining iPhone sales and a stretched valuation, compounded by a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), which indicates bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from various models consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to the mixed signals and recent underperformance. While there is potential for positive surprises, the current cautious outlook and bearish sentiment make the probability of a stock price fall seem higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
