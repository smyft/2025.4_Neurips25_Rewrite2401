(AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market\nNews Content: Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.\n\nNew developments from Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.\n\nNvidia stock was set to open lower by more than 11%. Meanwhile fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off about 5% or more in pre-market trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ES=F)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nA slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With with index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.\n\nBut unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.\n\nIn 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the \"Magnificent Seven\" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.\n\nAs Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 22: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on January 22, 2025 in New York City. Stocks continued an upward swing opening up high a day after the Dow Jones closed up 500 points and the S&P 500 approaching an all-time high. The rise comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison made an announcement alongside President Donald Trump that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. (Photo by Michael M.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock is up 3.7% in early afternoon trading, driven by the perception that cost-effective AI models like DeepSeek's will benefit on-device AI for iPhones. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event. The negative sentiment surrounding AI infrastructure stocks due to DeepSeek's cost-effective model could indirectly affect Apple, although the article suggests Apple is benefiting from this shift. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts seem to outweigh the negatives in the short term, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The increased iPhone build estimates and positive market reaction to DeepSeek's model are strong indicators of a potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on potential TikTok restrictions. While this could indirectly benefit Instagram and, by extension, Meta, the impact on Apple is minimal and largely indirect.  The article primarily discusses Meta's strategies and financial investments in content creators.  Apple's stock price movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Meta's internal promotional campaigns. The news does not contain any information directly related to Apple's financial performance, product releases, or any other factors that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, leading to inflated prices on platforms like eBay. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is less clear. The frenzy may temporarily boost iPhone sales, but it's unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall revenue or profitability. Additionally, the uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong fundamentals likely mitigate any substantial negative impact. The news is more of a cultural phenomenon than a financial catalyst for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's AI leadership with the launch of Apple Intelligence and its potential impact on the stock price. While the article highlights Apple's advancements in AI, it also mentions that a BofA analyst, Wamsi Mohan, lowered the price target for Apple (AAPL) due to weak iPhone sales and a prolonged rollout of generative AI features. However, the analyst maintained a 'Buy' rating, citing Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's AI developments, such as Apple Intelligence, are expected to strengthen its position in the market. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but the estimates are adjusted based on the cautious tone regarding iPhone sales and AI adoption.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model. This has led to a decline in the stock prices of big tech companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla. As Apple is also a big tech company, it is likely to be affected by this trend. However, the article also mentions that big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis, and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter. Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to the company's strong earnings growth expectations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant investments in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape. JPMorgan's report suggests that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market is unsustainable, implying that Apple's strong fundamentals might support its valuation. However, the report also notes that there are substantial gaps in revenue expectations and actual revenue growth in the AI sector, which might cause volatility. Given Apple's strong position and the optimism around its AI initiatives, the stock price is likely to rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This could lead to a broader market decline affecting Apple. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. While there are some positive indicators, such as increased iPhone build estimates and Apple's strong fundamentals, the overall market sentiment is currently bearish. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On the positive side, Apple and Meta are surging while other AI giants are struggling, suggesting Apple is perceived as benefiting from the shift towards more cost-effective AI models. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, driven by strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event. The DeepSeek news is a double-edged sword. While it benefits Apple's on-device AI narrative, it also creates uncertainty in the broader AI investment landscape. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the positive momentum and JPMorgan's upgrade, I'm leaning towards a rise, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous predictions, but not significantly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The article doesn't provide any information about Apple's performance, prospects, or any other factors that would directly influence its stock price. While a TikTok ban *could* indirectly benefit Instagram and Meta, the connection to Apple is tenuous at best.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement in general. Given the lack of direct relevance, I assign a near-equal probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly favoring a neutral stance due to the absence of significant news impacting Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a unique market frenzy where iPhones with TikTok pre-installed are being sold at exorbitant prices due to the app's removal from the App Store. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is limited. The situation may temporarily boost iPhone sales, but it is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall revenue or profitability. The uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility, but Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong fundamentals likely mitigate any substantial negative impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a rise due to strong fundamentals and others towards a fall due to market uncertainty. Considering the indirect nature of the news and Apple's robust position, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model.

However, the report also notes that there are substantial gaps in revenue expectations and actual revenue growth in the AI sector, which might cause volatility. Given Apple's strong position and the optimism around its AI initiatives, the stock price is likely to rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This could lead to a broader market decline affecting Apple. However, there are mixed signals, as JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates and Apple's strong fundamentals suggest potential resilience. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the overall market sentiment is currently bearish. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising, but the potential for a rise exists due to strong fundamentals and positive demand indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On the positive side, Apple and Meta are outperforming other Big Tech companies due to the perception that cost-effective AI models like DeepSeek's will benefit on-device AI for iPhones. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital.

Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the positive momentum and JPMorgan's upgrade, I'm leaning towards a rise, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The fact that Apple is surging while other AI giants are crumbling is a strong indicator. I am increasing the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous predictions, but not significantly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to boost Instagram. This news is largely irrelevant to Apple.  There's no direct impact on Apple's financials, products, or operations mentioned. While some indirect, tenuous connections could be made (e.g., increased Instagram usage might marginally reduce TikTok usage, which could have a tiny impact on Apple's App Store revenue), these are highly speculative and unlikely to significantly move Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions on Apple's stock movement, reflecting general market uncertainty rather than this specific news.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the probability of a price change due to this news is very low.  I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to no change than either a rise or fall, reflecting the minimal impact of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a unique market frenzy where iPhones with TikTok pre-installed are being sold at exorbitant prices due to the app's removal from the App Store.

While there are concerns about competition in the AI space, particularly with the emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective models, Apple's strong fundamentals and advancements in AI are likely to support its stock price. The mixed sentiment from previous predictions, ranging from 0.25 to 0.7 for a rise, indicates uncertainty. However, the overall positive outlook on Apple's AI initiatives and strong profit margins suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model.

The initial surge in Apple and Meta's stock prices while other AI giants falter suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple's approach to AI, particularly on-device AI. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates further reinforce this positive outlook. However, the stock is still below its recent highs, and concerns about iPhone sales and downgrades persist. The emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model introduces uncertainty in the broader AI investment landscape. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. The trend seems to be shifting towards a more positive outlook, with some models increasing the probability of a rise. Given the positive momentum, JPMorgan's upgrade, and Apple's resilience, I'm leaning towards a rise, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The upcoming earnings report is a crucial factor to consider.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban, which has minimal direct impact on Apple.  The core news is about Meta's promotional activities and doesn't provide any information directly affecting Apple's financial performance, product releases, or other key factors. While a TikTok ban *could* indirectly benefit Meta's Instagram, the connection to Apple is tenuous at best.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions on Apple's stock movement, reflecting general market uncertainty rather than this specific news.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the mixed signals from previous predictions (some indicating a rise due to strong fundamentals and others a fall due to market uncertainty), I assign a near-equal probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly leaning towards a neutral stance. The overall market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in this specific news article will likely have a much larger impact on AAPL's stock price than this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article describes a frenzy over iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, leading to inflated prices on eBay.
