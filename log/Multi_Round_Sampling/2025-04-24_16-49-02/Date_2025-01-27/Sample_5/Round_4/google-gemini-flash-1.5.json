(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\nNews Content: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\n\nMeta\u00a0Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is trying to promoteInstagram by exploiting the absence of the Chinese rival TikTok download option from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google stores.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok, citing national security threats due to its ownership by ByteDance Ltd. However, recently, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay the TikTok ban after assuming charge as the new President on January 20.\n\nAlso Read: BYD, Geely, SAIC Contest EU\u2019s High EV Tariffs In Court\n\nPreviously, the Biden administration ordered ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face an effective ban on the app in the U.S. on January 19.\n\nTikTok, has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for ~4% of the U.S. digital ad market. Around 63% of teens aged 13 to 17 use TikTok compared to 59% who use Instagram, CNBC cites a 2023\u00a0Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent encouraged creators to promote Instagram on other short-form video apps, like TikTok, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube including three months of posting exclusivity by doling out attractive offers, CNBC cites from a creator contract details.\n\nMeta\u2019s monthly cash bonuses ranged from $10,000 to $50,000 to shift their videos to Instagram Reels, CNBC cites the Information. The deals last six months and obligate a creator to post a minimum of eight Instagram Reels per month.\n\nMeta paid over $2 billion to content creators\u00a0in 2024. Four million content creators have reportedly made money from the platform since 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies, includingOracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder and Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, emerged as eligible contenders for\u00a0TikTok after Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days.\n\nMETA Stock Prediction For 2025\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Meta through iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW) and Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ).\n\nPrice Action: META stock is down 1.57% at $637.71 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nQualcomm Gains $2 Billion Boost From Samsung S25 Chipset Deal, Analyst Highlights Growth in Handsets and Beyond\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock is up 3.7% in early afternoon trading, driven by the perception that cost-effective AI models like DeepSeek's will benefit on-device AI for iPhones. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event. The negative sentiment surrounding AI infrastructure stocks due to DeepSeek's cost-effective model could indirectly affect Apple, although the article suggests Apple is benefiting from this shift. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts seem to outweigh the negatives in the short term, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The increased iPhone build estimates and positive market reaction to DeepSeek's model are strong indicators of a potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on potential TikTok restrictions. While this could indirectly benefit Instagram and, by extension, Meta, the impact on Apple is minimal and largely indirect.  The article primarily discusses Meta's strategies and financial investments in content creators.  Apple's stock price movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Meta's internal promotional campaigns. The news does not contain any information directly related to Apple's financial performance, product releases, or any other factors that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, leading to inflated prices on platforms like eBay. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is less clear. The frenzy may temporarily boost iPhone sales, but it's unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall revenue or profitability. Additionally, the uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong fundamentals likely mitigate any substantial negative impact. The news is more of a cultural phenomenon than a financial catalyst for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's AI leadership with the launch of Apple Intelligence and its potential impact on the stock price. While the article highlights Apple's advancements in AI, it also mentions that a BofA analyst, Wamsi Mohan, lowered the price target for Apple (AAPL) due to weak iPhone sales and a prolonged rollout of generative AI features. However, the analyst maintained a 'Buy' rating, citing Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's AI developments, such as Apple Intelligence, are expected to strengthen its position in the market. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but the estimates are adjusted based on the cautious tone regarding iPhone sales and AI adoption.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model. This has led to a decline in the stock prices of big tech companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla. As Apple is also a big tech company, it is likely to be affected by this trend. However, the article also mentions that big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis, and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter. Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to the company's strong earnings growth expectations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant investments in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape. JPMorgan's report suggests that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market is unsustainable, implying that Apple's strong fundamentals might support its valuation. However, the report also notes that there are substantial gaps in revenue expectations and actual revenue growth in the AI sector, which might cause volatility. Given Apple's strong position and the optimism around its AI initiatives, the stock price is likely to rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This could lead to a broader market decline affecting Apple. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. While there are some positive indicators, such as increased iPhone build estimates and Apple's strong fundamentals, the overall market sentiment is currently bearish. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On the positive side, Apple and Meta are surging while other AI giants are struggling, suggesting Apple is perceived as benefiting from the shift towards more cost-effective AI models. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, driven by strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event. The DeepSeek news is a double-edged sword. While it benefits Apple's on-device AI narrative, it also creates uncertainty in the broader AI investment landscape. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the positive momentum and JPMorgan's upgrade, I'm leaning towards a rise, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous predictions, but not significantly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The article doesn't provide any information about Apple's performance, prospects, or any other factors that would directly influence its stock price. While a TikTok ban *could* indirectly benefit Instagram and Meta, the connection to Apple is tenuous at best.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement in general. Given the lack of direct relevance, I assign a near-equal probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly favoring a neutral stance due to the absence of significant news impacting Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a unique market frenzy where iPhones with TikTok pre-installed are being sold at exorbitant prices due to the app's removal from the App Store. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is limited. The situation may temporarily boost iPhone sales, but it is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall revenue or profitability. The uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility, but Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong fundamentals likely mitigate any substantial negative impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a rise due to strong fundamentals and others towards a fall due to market uncertainty. Considering the indirect nature of the news and Apple's robust position, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model.

However, the report also notes that there are substantial gaps in revenue expectations and actual revenue growth in the AI sector, which might cause volatility. Given Apple's strong position and the optimism around its AI initiatives, the stock price is likely to rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This could lead to a broader market decline affecting Apple. However, there are mixed signals, as JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates and Apple's strong fundamentals suggest potential resilience. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the overall market sentiment is currently bearish. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising, but the potential for a rise exists due to strong fundamentals and positive demand indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On the positive side, Apple and Meta are outperforming other Big Tech companies due to the perception that cost-effective AI models like DeepSeek's will benefit on-device AI for iPhones. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital.

Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the positive momentum and JPMorgan's upgrade, I'm leaning towards a rise, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The fact that Apple is surging while other AI giants are crumbling is a strong indicator. I am increasing the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous predictions, but not significantly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to boost Instagram. This news is largely irrelevant to Apple.  There's no direct impact on Apple's financials, products, or operations mentioned. While some indirect, tenuous connections could be made (e.g., increased Instagram usage might marginally reduce TikTok usage, which could have a tiny impact on Apple's App Store revenue), these are highly speculative and unlikely to significantly move Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions on Apple's stock movement, reflecting general market uncertainty rather than this specific news.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the probability of a price change due to this news is very low.  I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to no change than either a rise or fall, reflecting the minimal impact of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a unique market frenzy where iPhones with TikTok pre-installed are being sold at exorbitant prices due to the app's removal from the App Store.

While there are concerns about competition in the AI space, particularly with the emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective models, Apple's strong fundamentals and advancements in AI are likely to support its stock price. The mixed sentiment from previous predictions, ranging from 0.25 to 0.7 for a rise, indicates uncertainty. However, the overall positive outlook on Apple's AI initiatives and strong profit margins suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model.

The initial surge in Apple and Meta's stock prices while other AI giants falter suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple's approach to AI, particularly on-device AI. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates further reinforce this positive outlook. However, the stock is still below its recent highs, and concerns about iPhone sales and downgrades persist. The emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model introduces uncertainty in the broader AI investment landscape. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. The trend seems to be shifting towards a more positive outlook, with some models increasing the probability of a rise. Given the positive momentum, JPMorgan's upgrade, and Apple's resilience, I'm leaning towards a rise, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The upcoming earnings report is a crucial factor to consider.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban, which has minimal direct impact on Apple.

While a TikTok ban *could* indirectly benefit Meta's Instagram, the connection to Apple is tenuous at best.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions on Apple's stock movement, reflecting general market uncertainty rather than this specific news.
