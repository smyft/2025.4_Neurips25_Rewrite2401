(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock is up 3.7% in early afternoon trading, driven by the perception that cost-effective AI models like DeepSeek's will benefit on-device AI for iPhones. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event. The negative sentiment surrounding AI infrastructure stocks due to DeepSeek's cost-effective model could indirectly affect Apple, although the article suggests Apple is benefiting from this shift. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts seem to outweigh the negatives in the short term, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The increased iPhone build estimates and positive market reaction to DeepSeek's model are strong indicators of a potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on potential TikTok restrictions. While this could indirectly benefit Instagram and, by extension, Meta, the impact on Apple is minimal and largely indirect.  The article primarily discusses Meta's strategies and financial investments in content creators.  Apple's stock price movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Meta's internal promotional campaigns. The news does not contain any information directly related to Apple's financial performance, product releases, or any other factors that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, leading to inflated prices on platforms like eBay. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is less clear. The frenzy may temporarily boost iPhone sales, but it's unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall revenue or profitability. Additionally, the uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong fundamentals likely mitigate any substantial negative impact. The news is more of a cultural phenomenon than a financial catalyst for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's AI leadership with the launch of Apple Intelligence and its potential impact on the stock price. While the article highlights Apple's advancements in AI, it also mentions that a BofA analyst, Wamsi Mohan, lowered the price target for Apple (AAPL) due to weak iPhone sales and a prolonged rollout of generative AI features. However, the analyst maintained a 'Buy' rating, citing Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's AI developments, such as Apple Intelligence, are expected to strengthen its position in the market. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but the estimates are adjusted based on the cautious tone regarding iPhone sales and AI adoption.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model. This has led to a decline in the stock prices of big tech companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla. As Apple is also a big tech company, it is likely to be affected by this trend. However, the article also mentions that big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis, and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter. Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to the company's strong earnings growth expectations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant investments in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape. JPMorgan's report suggests that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market is unsustainable, implying that Apple's strong fundamentals might support its valuation. However, the report also notes that there are substantial gaps in revenue expectations and actual revenue growth in the AI sector, which might cause volatility. Given Apple's strong position and the optimism around its AI initiatives, the stock price is likely to rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. This could lead to a broader market decline affecting Apple. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. While there are some positive indicators, such as increased iPhone build estimates and Apple's strong fundamentals, the overall market sentiment is currently bearish. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On the positive side, Apple and Meta are surging while other AI giants are struggling, suggesting Apple is perceived as benefiting from the shift towards more cost-effective AI models. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, driven by strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event. The DeepSeek news is a double-edged sword. While it benefits Apple's on-device AI narrative, it also creates uncertainty in the broader AI investment landscape. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the positive momentum and JPMorgan's upgrade, I'm leaning towards a rise, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous predictions, but not significantly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The article doesn't provide any information about Apple's performance, prospects, or any other factors that would directly influence its stock price. While a TikTok ban *could* indirectly benefit Instagram and Meta, the connection to Apple is tenuous at best.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement in general. Given the lack of direct relevance, I assign a near-equal probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly favoring a neutral stance due to the absence of significant news impacting Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a unique market frenzy where iPhones with TikTok pre-installed are being sold at exorbitant prices due to the app's removal from the App Store. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is limited. The situation may temporarily boost iPhone sales, but it is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall revenue or profitability. The uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility, but Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong fundamentals likely mitigate any substantial negative impact. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a rise due to strong fundamentals and others towards a fall due to market uncertainty. Considering the indirect nature of the news and Apple's robust position, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model.

This could lead to a broader market decline affecting Apple. However, there are mixed signals, as JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates and Apple's strong fundamentals suggest potential resilience. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the overall market sentiment is currently bearish. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising, but the potential for a rise exists due to strong fundamentals and positive demand indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On the positive side, Apple and Meta are outperforming other Big Tech companies due to the perception that cost-effective AI models like DeepSeek's will benefit on-device AI for iPhones. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital.

Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the positive momentum and JPMorgan's upgrade, I'm leaning towards a rise, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The fact that Apple is surging while other AI giants are crumbling is a strong indicator. I am increasing the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous predictions, but not significantly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to boost Instagram. This news is largely irrelevant to Apple.  There's no direct impact on Apple's financials, products, or operations mentioned. While some indirect, tenuous connections could be made (e.g., increased Instagram usage might marginally reduce TikTok usage, which could have a tiny impact on Apple's App Store revenue), these are highly speculative and unlikely to significantly move Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions on Apple's stock movement, reflecting general market uncertainty rather than this specific news.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the probability of a price change due to this news is very low.  I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to no change than either a rise or fall, reflecting the minimal impact of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a unique market frenzy where iPhones with TikTok pre-installed are being sold at exorbitant prices due to the app's removal from the App Store.

While there are concerns about competition in the AI space, particularly with the emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective models, Apple's strong fundamentals and advancements in AI are likely to support its stock price. The mixed sentiment from previous predictions, ranging from 0.25 to 0.7 for a rise, indicates uncertainty. However, the overall positive outlook on Apple's AI initiatives and strong profit margins suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model.
