A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is causing stock futures to fall. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock is up 3.7% in early afternoon trading, driven by the perception that cost-effective AI models like DeepSeek's will benefit on-device AI for iPhones. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and the company faces iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event. The negative sentiment surrounding AI infrastructure stocks due to DeepSeek's cost-effective model could indirectly affect Apple, although the article suggests Apple is benefiting from this shift. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts seem to outweigh the negatives in the short term, but the downgrades and overall market uncertainty temper the potential upside. The increased iPhone build estimates and positive market reaction to DeepSeek's model are strong indicators of a potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on potential TikTok restrictions. While this could indirectly benefit Instagram and, by extension, Meta, the impact on Apple is minimal and largely indirect.  The article primarily discusses Meta's strategies and financial investments in content creators.  Apple's stock price movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Meta's internal promotional campaigns. The news does not contain any information directly related to Apple's financial performance, product releases, or any other factors that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, leading to inflated prices on platforms like eBay. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is less clear. The frenzy may temporarily boost iPhone sales, but it's unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall revenue or profitability. Additionally, the uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong fundamentals likely mitigate any substantial negative impact. The news is more of a cultural phenomenon than a financial catalyst for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's AI leadership with the launch of Apple Intelligence and its potential impact on the stock price. While the article highlights Apple's advancements in AI, it also mentions that a BofA analyst, Wamsi Mohan, lowered the price target for Apple (AAPL) due to weak iPhone sales and a prolonged rollout of generative AI features. However, the analyst maintained a 'Buy' rating, citing Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's AI developments, such as Apple Intelligence, are expected to strengthen its position in the market. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but the estimates are adjusted based on the cautious tone regarding iPhone sales and AI adoption.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly with the launch of DeepSeek's AI model. This has led to a decline in the stock prices of big tech companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla. As Apple is also a big tech company, it is likely to be affected by this trend. However, the article also mentions that big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis, and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter. Given this mixed information, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling in the short term, but still possible due to the company's strong earnings growth expectations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant investments in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape. JPMorgan's report suggests that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market is unsustainable, implying that Apple's strong fundamentals might support its valuation. However, the report also notes that there are substantial gaps in revenue expectations and actual revenue growth in the AI sector, which might cause volatility. Given Apple's strong position and the optimism around its AI initiatives, the stock price is likely to rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
