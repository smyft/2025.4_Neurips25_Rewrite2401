Red Cat Holdings, Inc. RCAT\n\nRed Cat Holdings is a small cap company with a market cap of $701 million which makes drone technology for military, government, and commercial operations.\n\nShares of Red Cat Holdings are down 41% year-to-date, but the shares have soared 1003% over the last year.

Tracey talked about the gold trade, specifically with the miners, in a 2024 podcast because the price of gold was hitting new highs.\n\nShares of Barrick Gold are up 2.3% year-to-date but have only gained 1.5% over the last year. It's cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.7. 2025 earnings are expected to rise 30.3%.\n\nBarrick Gold is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nShould a gold miner, like Barrick Gold, be on your short list?\n\n3.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Overall, while there is potential for growth in AI, the immediate outlook appears mixed due to the lowered expectations for iPhone sales. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the risks of a potential decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges the company's recent underperformance and concerns about China and its AI strategy, it also highlights the potential for a positive catalyst in the form of an AI partnership announcement. The article mentions bearish analysts projecting a guidance cut and downward revisions to EPS estimates, which are negative signals. However, it also notes that Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and that the China headwinds are manageable. Given the conflicting signals, the probability of a price rise or fall is somewhat balanced, but the recent negative trend and analyst concerns slightly tilt the odds towards a price decrease. The earnings report on January 30th will be crucial in determining the stock's direction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece highlights mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings announcement. While the overall market is showing strong growth, Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market performance and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downward. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships in the Chinese AI market as a positive catalyst. The news itself is not definitively positive or negative, but rather presents a balanced view of the current situation.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the uncertainty and the balance of bullish and bearish perspectives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a broader market analysis, mentioning that its shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are up only 15.4% over the last year. It notes that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article poses a question about whether a further decline in Apple's stock price would present a buying opportunity, suggesting mixed sentiment. Given the negative year-to-date performance, high valuation, and Sell rating, the market may react cautiously.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) potential stock movement in relation to Apple's (AAPL) upcoming quarterly results on January 30. Historically, when Apple has reported strong results, its stock has risen significantly, but Berkshire Hathaway's stock price has not seen a correspondingly significant increase. For example, in 2020, Apple's stock soared 10.5% after beating expectations, but Berkshire Hathaway's stock increased by less than 1%. Similarly, in 2022, Apple's stock jumped 7% after posting great results, but Berkshire Hathaway's shares only rose by 1.7%. Given this historical data, it seems that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price movement is not strongly correlated with Apple's quarterly results. Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising or falling directly due to Apple's results is relatively low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's quarterly earnings are expected to increase by 8.3% and revenues by 3.7% year over year. However, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days. Additionally, the company's shares have returned -12.8% over the past month, and it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance in the near future. Considering these factors, the likelihood of the stock price rising seems lower than the likelihood of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has seen a positive reaction from the market, with its stock jumping more than 2% on Monday. This upward movement is attributed to the company reacting positively to news about DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest that Apple will benefit from developing better AI products in the iPhone due to such advancements. Despite this positive news, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month, and it faces challenges such as iPhone sales struggles and downgrades from investment firms. However, the overall market sentiment remains positive with a majority of analysts recommending a buy on the stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Analysts have mixed views, with some expressing cautious optimism about Apple's AI initiatives while others point to potential headwinds from competition and sales estimates. Given the overall mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but with significant risks that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report and highlights mixed sentiment. Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and EPS estimates have been revised downward. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate a positive catalyst in the form of an AI partnership announcement. The previous round of predictions show a slight bearish trend, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the negative sentiment and downward revisions, I will slightly increase the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the upcoming earnings announcement is anticipated with some positive expectations (overall market growth, potential AI partnerships), significant headwinds exist.  Apple's recent underperformance, concerns about the China market and AI strategy, bearish analyst projections of a guidance cut, and downward revisions to EPS estimates all point towards a potential price decline.  The positive sentiment from some analysts who believe the negative sentiment is overdone and the potential for an AI partnership announcement offer some counterbalance. However, the weight of negative factors, including the recent 15% stock price drop and the downward revisions to EPS estimates, suggests a higher probability of a price fall. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price decrease. Considering all these factors, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and a key holding in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, which could lend some stability and long-term confidence. However, the article notes that Apple's stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and is only up 15.4% over the last year, indicating recent underperformance. Additionally, Apple's forward P/E ratio of 30.1 is considered high, and it carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), suggesting potential near-term downside. The article also questions whether a further decline would present a buying opportunity, reflecting uncertainty. Given these factors, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a slight tilt towards negative due to the high valuation and Sell rating. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average probability of 0.52 for a fall and 0.43 for a rise. Considering all this, the probabilities are assigned accordingly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with expected increases in quarterly earnings and revenues, but also a downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate and a recent decline in the company's shares. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests potential underperformance in the near future. Considering the mixed signals and the recent negative trend, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than the likelihood of it falling. However, the estimated increases in earnings and revenues, as well as the potential for growth in certain segments, prevent the probability of a price fall from being excessively high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's positive reaction to the release of DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model, which could potentially improve Apple's AI capabilities in the iPhone. This news is likely to boost investor confidence and support the stock price. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month, and it faces challenges such as iPhone sales struggles and downgrades from investment firms. Despite these challenges, the majority of analysts recommend buying the stock, and they see shares rising to $246 over the next 12 months. The recent predictions show mixed sentiments, but the latest news leans towards a positive outcome.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, there are concerns regarding the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the weak macro environment, which may create short-term performance issues. Analysts have mixed views, with some expressing cautious optimism about Apple's AI initiatives while others point to potential headwinds from competition and sales estimates. Given the overall mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but with significant risks that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and earnings are on deck, the stock has struggled lately, lagging behind its peers and losing 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high. Concerns about China and its AI strategy are weighing on the stock. Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. The previous round of predictions leaned towards a price decrease. Considering the negative sentiment and downward revisions, I will maintain a slightly bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the upcoming earnings report is anticipated with some positive expectations (overall market growth, potential AI partnerships), significant headwinds exist. Apple's recent underperformance (15% drop since Christmas), concerns about the China market and AI strategy, bearish analyst projections of a guidance cut, and downward revisions to EPS estimates all point towards a potential price decline.  The positive sentiment from some analysts who believe the negative sentiment is overdone and the potential for an AI partnership announcement offer some counterbalance. However, the weight of negative factors, including the recent stock price drop and the downward revisions to EPS estimates, suggests a higher probability of a price fall.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price decrease.  Considering all these factors, and giving more weight to the recent negative trend and analyst concerns, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise.  The fact that the earnings announcement is imminent adds to the uncertainty, as the results could significantly impact the stock price in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is recognized as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and a significant holding in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, which could provide some long-term confidence.
