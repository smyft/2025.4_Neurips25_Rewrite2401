      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Overall, while there is potential for growth in AI, the immediate outlook appears mixed due to the lowered expectations for iPhone sales. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the risks of a potential decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges the company's recent underperformance and concerns about China and its AI strategy, it also highlights the potential for a positive catalyst in the form of an AI partnership announcement. The article mentions bearish analysts projecting a guidance cut and downward revisions to EPS estimates, which are negative signals. However, it also notes that Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and that the China headwinds are manageable. Given the conflicting signals, the probability of a price rise or fall is somewhat balanced, but the recent negative trend and analyst concerns slightly tilt the odds towards a price decrease. The earnings report on January 30th will be crucial in determining the stock's direction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece highlights mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings announcement. While the overall market is showing strong growth, Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market performance and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downward. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships in the Chinese AI market as a positive catalyst. The news itself is not definitively positive or negative, but rather presents a balanced view of the current situation.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the uncertainty and the balance of bullish and bearish perspectives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a broader market analysis, mentioning that its shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are up only 15.4% over the last year. It notes that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article poses a question about whether a further decline in Apple's stock price would present a buying opportunity, suggesting mixed sentiment. Given the negative year-to-date performance, high valuation, and Sell rating, the market may react cautiously.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) potential stock movement in relation to Apple's (AAPL) upcoming quarterly results on January 30. Historically, when Apple has reported strong results, its stock has risen significantly, but Berkshire Hathaway's stock price has not seen a correspondingly significant increase. For example, in 2020, Apple's stock soared 10.5% after beating expectations, but Berkshire Hathaway's stock increased by less than 1%. Similarly, in 2022, Apple's stock jumped 7% after posting great results, but Berkshire Hathaway's shares only rose by 1.7%. Given this historical data, it seems that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price movement is not strongly correlated with Apple's quarterly results. Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising or falling directly due to Apple's results is relatively low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's quarterly earnings are expected to increase by 8.3% and revenues by 3.7% year over year. However, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days. Additionally, the company's shares have returned -12.8% over the past month, and it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance in the near future. Considering these factors, the likelihood of the stock price rising seems lower than the likelihood of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has seen a positive reaction from the market, with its stock jumping more than 2% on Monday. This upward movement is attributed to the company reacting positively to news about DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest that Apple will benefit from developing better AI products in the iPhone due to such advancements. Despite this positive news, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month, and it faces challenges such as iPhone sales struggles and downgrades from investment firms. However, the overall market sentiment remains positive with a majority of analysts recommending a buy on the stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Analysts have mixed views, with some expressing cautious optimism about Apple's AI initiatives while others point to potential headwinds from competition and sales estimates. Given the overall mixed sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but with significant risks that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report and highlights mixed sentiment. Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and EPS estimates have been revised downward. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate a positive catalyst in the form of an AI partnership announcement. The previous round of predictions show a slight bearish trend, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the negative sentiment and downward revisions, I will slightly increase the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the upcoming earnings announcement is anticipated with some positive expectations (overall market growth, potential AI partnerships), significant headwinds exist.  Apple's recent underperformance, concerns about the China market and AI strategy, bearish analyst projections of a guidance cut, and downward revisions to EPS estimates all point towards a potential price decline.  The positive sentiment from some analysts who believe the negative sentiment is overdone and the potential for an AI partnership announcement offer some counterbalance. However, the weight of negative factors, including the recent 15% stock price drop and the downward revisions to EPS estimates, suggests a higher probability of a price fall. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price decrease. Considering all these factors, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and a key holding in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, which could lend some stability and long-term confidence. However, the article notes that Apple's stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and is only up 15.4% over the last year, indicating recent underperformance. Additionally, Apple's forward P/E ratio of 30.1 is considered high, and it carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), suggesting potential near-term downside. The article also questions whether a further decline would present a buying opportunity, reflecting uncertainty. Given these factors, the market sentiment appears cautious, with a slight tilt towards negative due to the high valuation and Sell rating. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average probability of 0.52 for a fall and 0.43 for a rise. Considering all this, the probabilities are assigned accordingly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with expected increases in quarterly earnings and revenues, but also a downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate and a recent decline in the company's shares. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests potential underperformance in the near future. Considering the mixed signals and the recent negative trend, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than the likelihood of it falling. However, the estimated increases in earnings and revenues, as well as the potential for growth in certain segments, prevent the probability of a price fall from being excessively high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's positive reaction to the release of DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model, which could potentially improve Apple's AI capabilities in the iPhone. This news is likely to boost investor confidence and support the stock price. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month, and it faces challenges such as iPhone sales struggles and downgrades from investment firms. Despite these challenges, the majority of analysts recommend buying the stock, and they see shares rising to $246 over the next 12 months. The recent predictions show mixed sentiments, but the latest news leans towards a positive outcome.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

While it is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and earnings are on deck, the stock has struggled lately, lagging behind its peers and losing 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high. Concerns about China and its AI strategy are weighing on the stock. Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. The previous round of predictions leaned towards a price decrease. Considering the negative sentiment and downward revisions, I will maintain a slightly bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.

The fact that the earnings announcement is imminent adds to the uncertainty, as the results could significantly impact the stock price in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect a positive catalyst from an upcoming AI partnership.  The previous predictions from various models show a consistent leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall (averaging around 0.55-0.6).  Considering the negative sentiment, downward revisions, and the imminent earnings announcement (which could significantly impact the stock price), I assign a higher probability to a price fall.  The potential for a positive AI partnership announcement provides some counterbalance, but the weight of negative factors currently outweighs the potential positives.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```\n"
