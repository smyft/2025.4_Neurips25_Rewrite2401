(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Unveiling Apple (AAPL) Q1 Outlook: Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics\nNews Content: The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Services' reaching $26.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' will reach $7.71 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' to reach $52.23 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross margin- Services' to come in at $19.36 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $16.84 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Apple have returned -12.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights significant enhancements to Apple's App Store tools and a surge in iOS 18 adoption, indicating strong customer acceptance and potential for increased developer engagement. These factors suggest a positive outlook for Apple's ecosystem, which could lead to higher app sales and user engagement. The improvements in app management and user experience are likely to attract more developers, further solidifying Apple's competitive position in the app market. Given these positive developments, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, there's a downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several key factors point towards a potential price decline.  The downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days (-1.1%) is a significant negative indicator, suggesting analyst pessimism.  Furthermore, the projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver of Apple's performance, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further reinforces the negative sentiment.  While some segments like Services show strong growth, the overall picture is tempered by the iPhone revenue decline and the downward revision of EPS estimates. The recent -12.8% share return also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive shift for Apple (AAPL) amid a broader AI sector sell-off. Key bullish factors include: 1) Apple's stock surged 3.7% due to optimism around cost-efficient AI models benefiting iPhone on-device AI capabilities, 2) JPMorgan raised iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing stronger-than-expected demand in China, and 3) anticipation of a solid earnings report on January 30. However, bearish risks remain, such as iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, which have kept the stock 12% below recent highs. Overall, the immediate market reaction and positive sentiment around AI efficiency and iPhone demand outweigh the lingering concerns, suggesting a higher probability of a continued rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's stock price rose due to its potential to benefit from more efficient AI models, such as the one released by DeepSeek. This could indicate a positive short-term outlook for the company's stock. Despite recent downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales, Apple's stock jumped more than 2%, bucking the trend of its peers. The upcoming earnings report and potential for better AI products on the iPhone could further boost investor confidence. However, it's essential to consider that the stock is still down 12% from last month, and there might be some volatility before the earnings report on January 30.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports on the unveiling of China's new AI chatbot, DeepSeek, which has sent tech stocks plunging due to its potential to match major global competitors at a lower cost. The article mentions that DeepSeek's developers claim it was created with only $5.6m, which is significantly less than the billions US tech giants have poured into AI. This news has led to a sell-off in US tech shares, with the Nasdaq down 3% in premarket trading and chip giant Nvidia on track to open 8% lower. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) will be affected, although the article does not specifically mention Apple's involvement in the AI chatbot market. However, as a major tech company, Apple's stock price may still be impacted by the overall trend in the tech industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news discusses how major companies are framing their Artificial Intelligence narratives during earnings calls. Since Apple is one of the companies mentioned, it implies that there might be updates or discussions around Apple's AI initiatives. Positive updates on AI can generally be seen as a positive catalyst for the stock price. However, without specific details about Apple's AI narrative, it's hard to gauge the exact impact. The market might react positively if the narrative is viewed favorably, or there could be no change if the narrative is neutral or already priced in.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
