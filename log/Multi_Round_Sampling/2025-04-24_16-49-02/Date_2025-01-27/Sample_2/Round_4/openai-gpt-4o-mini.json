A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights significant enhancements to Apple's App Store tools and a surge in iOS 18 adoption, indicating strong customer acceptance and potential for increased developer engagement. These factors suggest a positive outlook for Apple's ecosystem, which could lead to higher app sales and user engagement. The improvements in app management and user experience are likely to attract more developers, further solidifying Apple's competitive position in the app market. Given these positive developments, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, there's a downward revision in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several key factors point towards a potential price decline.  The downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days (-1.1%) is a significant negative indicator, suggesting analyst pessimism.  Furthermore, the projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver of Apple's performance, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further reinforces the negative sentiment.  While some segments like Services show strong growth, the overall picture is tempered by the iPhone revenue decline and the downward revision of EPS estimates. The recent -12.8% share return also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive shift for Apple (AAPL) amid a broader AI sector sell-off. Key bullish factors include: 1) Apple's stock surged 3.7% due to optimism around cost-efficient AI models benefiting iPhone on-device AI capabilities, 2) JPMorgan raised iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing stronger-than-expected demand in China, and 3) anticipation of a solid earnings report on January 30. However, bearish risks remain, such as iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, which have kept the stock 12% below recent highs. Overall, the immediate market reaction and positive sentiment around AI efficiency and iPhone demand outweigh the lingering concerns, suggesting a higher probability of a continued rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's stock price rose due to its potential to benefit from more efficient AI models, such as the one released by DeepSeek. This could indicate a positive short-term outlook for the company's stock. Despite recent downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales, Apple's stock jumped more than 2%, bucking the trend of its peers. The upcoming earnings report and potential for better AI products on the iPhone could further boost investor confidence. However, it's essential to consider that the stock is still down 12% from last month, and there might be some volatility before the earnings report on January 30.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports on the unveiling of China's new AI chatbot, DeepSeek, which has sent tech stocks plunging due to its potential to match major global competitors at a lower cost. The article mentions that DeepSeek's developers claim it was created with only $5.6m, which is significantly less than the billions US tech giants have poured into AI. This news has led to a sell-off in US tech shares, with the Nasdaq down 3% in premarket trading and chip giant Nvidia on track to open 8% lower. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) will be affected, although the article does not specifically mention Apple's involvement in the AI chatbot market. However, as a major tech company, Apple's stock price may still be impacted by the overall trend in the tech industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news discusses how major companies are framing their Artificial Intelligence narratives during earnings calls. Since Apple is one of the companies mentioned, it implies that there might be updates or discussions around Apple's AI initiatives. Positive updates on AI can generally be seen as a positive catalyst for the stock price. However, without specific details about Apple's AI narrative, it's hard to gauge the exact impact. The market might react positively if the narrative is viewed favorably, or there could be no change if the narrative is neutral or already priced in.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights significant enhancements to Apple's App Store tools and a surge in iOS 18 adoption, indicating strong customer acceptance and potential for increased developer engagement. These factors suggest a positive outlook for Apple's ecosystem, which could lead to higher app sales and user engagement. The improvements in app management and user experience are likely to attract more developers, further solidifying Apple's competitive position in the app market. However, previous predictions indicate mixed sentiments, with some concerns about iPhone revenue and downward revisions in EPS estimates. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise due to the positive developments in the App Store and iOS adoption.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase, the downward revision of EPS estimates and a projected decline in iPhone revenue are concerning. However, strong growth in Services and positive trends in other product categories and geographic regions offer some counterbalance. The recent underperformance of AAPL compared to the S&P 500 and its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest caution. Considering the mixed signals and the negative sentiment reflected in the stock's recent performance, I believe the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The previous rounds of predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models emphasizing the positive aspects and others focusing on the negative. The trend seems to be leaning towards a more negative outlook, especially considering the downward EPS revision and iPhone revenue concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected revenue and EPS show modest growth, several factors suggest caution.  The downward revision of EPS estimates (-1.1% in 30 days) is a significant negative.  The projected decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%) is concerning, despite growth in other segments. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and recent -12.8% share return reflect negative investor sentiment.  While Services revenue shows strong growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated.  The previous predictions are also quite varied, highlighting uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the downward revision of EPS, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall uncertainty warrants a probability closer to 0.5 for both rise and fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the bullish side, Apple's stock surged 3.7% due to optimism around cost-efficient AI models benefiting iPhone on-device AI capabilities, and JPMorgan raised iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing stronger-than-expected demand in China. Additionally, anticipation of a solid earnings report on January 30 could further boost investor confidence. On the bearish side, iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital have kept the stock 12% below recent highs. However, the immediate market reaction and positive sentiment around AI efficiency and iPhone demand appear to outweigh the lingering concerns. Considering the previous predictions, which leaned slightly bullish (with models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and meta-llama/llama-4-scout favoring a rise), the overall probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's positive reaction to DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model, which could enhance Apple's AI products on its iPhone. This development, along with Meta's rise and the overall trend of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks, suggests a favorable short-term outlook for Apple's stock. Additionally, Apple's upcoming earnings report and potential efficiency gains in AI models could further boost investor confidence. However, concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital still exist. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems higher than a fall, but with caution due to the mixed outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the unveiling of China's new AI chatbot, DeepSeek, which has sent tech stocks plunging due to its potential to match major global competitors at a lower cost. Apple's stock price rose 2.6% despite the overall tech sell-off, indicating a potential positive outlook for the company. However, the article also mentions that the Nasdaq Composite index plummeted by 3.6% and Nvidia's stock price dropped 13%, which could have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the mixed signals, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising as 0.45 and the probability of it falling as 0.55.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights significant enhancements to Apple's App Store tools and a surge in iOS 18 adoption, indicating strong customer acceptance and potential for increased developer engagement.

While projected revenue and EPS show modest growth, several factors suggest caution. The downward revision of EPS estimates (-1.1% in 30 days) is a significant negative. The projected decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%), a major revenue driver, is concerning, despite growth in other segments like Services.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and recent -12.8% share return reflect negative investor sentiment.  While some segments show growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated. Previous predictions are varied, highlighting uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the downward revision of EPS, and the overall negative market sentiment reflected in the Zacks Rank and recent stock performance, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, the relatively small negative changes in iPhone revenue and the positive growth in other segments prevent a significantly higher probability of a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL).
