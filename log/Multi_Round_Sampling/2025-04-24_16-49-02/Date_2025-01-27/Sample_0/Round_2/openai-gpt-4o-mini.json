(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\nNews Content: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\n\nMeta\u00a0Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is trying to promoteInstagram by exploiting the absence of the Chinese rival TikTok download option from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google stores.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok, citing national security threats due to its ownership by ByteDance Ltd. However, recently, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay the TikTok ban after assuming charge as the new President on January 20.\n\nAlso Read: BYD, Geely, SAIC Contest EU\u2019s High EV Tariffs In Court\n\nPreviously, the Biden administration ordered ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face an effective ban on the app in the U.S. on January 19.\n\nTikTok, has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for ~4% of the U.S. digital ad market. Around 63% of teens aged 13 to 17 use TikTok compared to 59% who use Instagram, CNBC cites a 2023\u00a0Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent encouraged creators to promote Instagram on other short-form video apps, like TikTok, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube including three months of posting exclusivity by doling out attractive offers, CNBC cites from a creator contract details.\n\nMeta\u2019s monthly cash bonuses ranged from $10,000 to $50,000 to shift their videos to Instagram Reels, CNBC cites the Information. The deals last six months and obligate a creator to post a minimum of eight Instagram Reels per month.\n\nMeta paid over $2 billion to content creators\u00a0in 2024. Four million content creators have reportedly made money from the platform since 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies, includingOracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder and Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, emerged as eligible contenders for\u00a0TikTok after Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days.\n\nMETA Stock Prediction For 2025\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Meta through iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW) and Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ).\n\nPrice Action: META stock is down 1.57% at $637.71 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nQualcomm Gains $2 Billion Boost From Samsung S25 Chipset Deal, Analyst Highlights Growth in Handsets and Beyond\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which could indirectly affect Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. While the news may create some uncertainty around TikTok's future and its impact on digital advertising, it does not directly indicate any negative developments for Apple. However, the competitive landscape in social media and digital advertising could influence investor sentiment. Given that the news does not present any immediate threats to Apple's business model or financial performance, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with 'Apple Intelligence' and its strong position among AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 also contributes to a negative sentiment. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating citing strong profit margins and future improvements. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting that while the AI initiative is positive, near-term market conditions and the slow adoption of Apple Intelligence could negatively impact the stock price in the short term. The article's focus on other AI stocks with potentially higher returns further dilutes the positive impact of Apple's AI efforts on its stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) significant investments in AI, positioning it as a key player in the AI landscape with innovations like Siri, on-device machine learning, and proprietary AI chips. The article also mentions Apple's inclusion in JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025, which could boost investor confidence. However, the report cautions about valuation discrepancies and potential earnings disappointments in the AI sector, which could lead to volatility. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, ecosystem growth, and AI-driven innovations, the positive sentiment likely outweighs the risks. The probability of a stock price rise is higher, but there is still a non-negligible chance of a fall due to broader market concerns about AI valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. However, it notes that historically, Berkshire's stock price has not reacted strongly to Apple's performance. The article also mentions that Berkshire's current valuation is not particularly attractive, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6, and that Warren Buffett has not been buying back shares, which could indicate that he does not see the stock as undervalued. Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising due to Apple's results is moderate, but not high. On the other hand, the probability of the stock price falling is also moderate, given that the article does not present overwhelmingly positive arguments for Berkshire's stock price to increase significantly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's efforts to promote Instagram by exploiting the potential ban of TikTok, a rival social media platform. The article highlights Meta's strategy of offering cash deals to creators to promote Instagram on other social media platforms. However, the article does not directly mention any impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Since the news is more focused on Meta and TikTok, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low. Nevertheless, as Apple is mentioned as one of the companies that removed TikTok from its app store, there might be a slight positive impact on Apple's stock if investors perceive the potential ban of TikTok as a benefit to Apple's ecosystem.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there are concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the impact of China on its market. On the other hand, there are potential positives such as the possibility of an AI partnership. The recent dip in stock price could make investors more cautious, but it also presents an opportunity for bullish sentiment if the earnings report beats expectations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which indirectly affects Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. While there is no direct negative impact on Apple from this news, the competitive landscape in social media and digital advertising could create some uncertainty. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a slight positive outlook for Apple due to its investments in AI and its strong market position. However, concerns about high valuations and potential volatility in the tech sector remain. Overall, the probabilities suggest a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking as 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This is generally positive. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector, potential earnings disappointments, and escalating trade tensions between the US and China. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The previous round predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the slightly positive news and the mixed previous predictions, I will lean slightly towards a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the headline emphasizes Apple's AI leadership, the article's content reveals a more nuanced picture.  A BofA analyst lowered the price target due to a weak macro environment and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple Intelligence.  The reduced iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens near-term prospects.  However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, highlighting strong profit margins and future potential.  The article also positions Apple as a strong contender in the AI race but suggests other AI stocks might offer quicker, higher returns.  Considering the mixed signals \u2013 a lowered price target alongside a 'Buy' rating, a weak macro environment, and the relatively slow rollout of Apple Intelligence \u2013 the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall in the short term.  The long-term outlook remains positive due to Apple's strong fundamentals and AI investments, but this is not reflected in the immediate impact of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) significant investments in AI, positioning it as a key player in the AI landscape with innovations like Siri, on-device machine learning, and proprietary AI chips.

The probability of a stock price rise is higher, but there is still a non-negligible chance of a fall due to broader market concerns about AI valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. However, as Apple is mentioned as one of the companies that removed TikTok from its app store, there might be a slight positive impact on Apple's stock if investors perceive the potential ban of TikTok as a benefit to Apple's ecosystem. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct implications for Apple, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Taking into account the mixed sentiments and the indirect impact of the news on Apple, the estimated probabilities are moderately balanced.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there are concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the impact of China on its market, leading to a potential guidance cut and a decline in stock price. On the other hand, there are potential positives such as the possibility of an AI partnership, which could boost investor confidence. The recent dip in stock price could make investors more cautious, but it also presents an opportunity for bullish sentiment if the earnings report beats expectations. The trend in previous predictions shows a range of opinions, with some predicting a rise and others a fall. Given the mixed signals and recent trends, the probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
