(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which could indirectly affect Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. While the news may create some uncertainty around TikTok's future and its impact on digital advertising, it does not directly indicate any negative developments for Apple. However, the competitive landscape in social media and digital advertising could influence investor sentiment. Given that the news does not present any immediate threats to Apple's business model or financial performance, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with 'Apple Intelligence' and its strong position among AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 also contributes to a negative sentiment. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating citing strong profit margins and future improvements. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting that while the AI initiative is positive, near-term market conditions and the slow adoption of Apple Intelligence could negatively impact the stock price in the short term. The article's focus on other AI stocks with potentially higher returns further dilutes the positive impact of Apple's AI efforts on its stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) significant investments in AI, positioning it as a key player in the AI landscape with innovations like Siri, on-device machine learning, and proprietary AI chips. The article also mentions Apple's inclusion in JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025, which could boost investor confidence. However, the report cautions about valuation discrepancies and potential earnings disappointments in the AI sector, which could lead to volatility. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, ecosystem growth, and AI-driven innovations, the positive sentiment likely outweighs the risks. The probability of a stock price rise is higher, but there is still a non-negligible chance of a fall due to broader market concerns about AI valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. However, it notes that historically, Berkshire's stock price has not reacted strongly to Apple's performance. The article also mentions that Berkshire's current valuation is not particularly attractive, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6, and that Warren Buffett has not been buying back shares, which could indicate that he does not see the stock as undervalued. Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising due to Apple's results is moderate, but not high. On the other hand, the probability of the stock price falling is also moderate, given that the article does not present overwhelmingly positive arguments for Berkshire's stock price to increase significantly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's efforts to promote Instagram by exploiting the potential ban of TikTok, a rival social media platform. The article highlights Meta's strategy of offering cash deals to creators to promote Instagram on other social media platforms. However, the article does not directly mention any impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Since the news is more focused on Meta and TikTok, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low. Nevertheless, as Apple is mentioned as one of the companies that removed TikTok from its app store, there might be a slight positive impact on Apple's stock if investors perceive the potential ban of TikTok as a benefit to Apple's ecosystem.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there are concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the impact of China on its market. On the other hand, there are potential positives such as the possibility of an AI partnership. The recent dip in stock price could make investors more cautious, but it also presents an opportunity for bullish sentiment if the earnings report beats expectations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
