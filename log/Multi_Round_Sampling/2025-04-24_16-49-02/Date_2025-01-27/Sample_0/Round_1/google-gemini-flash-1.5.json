(AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which could indirectly affect Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. While the news may create some uncertainty around TikTok's future and its impact on digital advertising, it does not directly indicate any negative developments for Apple. However, the competitive landscape in social media and digital advertising could influence investor sentiment. Given that the news does not present any immediate threats to Apple's business model or financial performance, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with 'Apple Intelligence' and its strong position among AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 also contributes to a negative sentiment. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating citing strong profit margins and future improvements. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting that while the AI initiative is positive, near-term market conditions and the slow adoption of Apple Intelligence could negatively impact the stock price in the short term. The article's focus on other AI stocks with potentially higher returns further dilutes the positive impact of Apple's AI efforts on its stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) significant investments in AI, positioning it as a key player in the AI landscape with innovations like Siri, on-device machine learning, and proprietary AI chips. The article also mentions Apple's inclusion in JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025, which could boost investor confidence. However, the report cautions about valuation discrepancies and potential earnings disappointments in the AI sector, which could lead to volatility. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, ecosystem growth, and AI-driven innovations, the positive sentiment likely outweighs the risks. The probability of a stock price rise is higher, but there is still a non-negligible chance of a fall due to broader market concerns about AI valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. However, it notes that historically, Berkshire's stock price has not reacted strongly to Apple's performance. The article also mentions that Berkshire's current valuation is not particularly attractive, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6, and that Warren Buffett has not been buying back shares, which could indicate that he does not see the stock as undervalued. Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising due to Apple's results is moderate, but not high. On the other hand, the probability of the stock price falling is also moderate, given that the article does not present overwhelmingly positive arguments for Berkshire's stock price to increase significantly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's efforts to promote Instagram by exploiting the potential ban of TikTok, a rival social media platform. The article highlights Meta's strategy of offering cash deals to creators to promote Instagram on other social media platforms. However, the article does not directly mention any impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Since the news is more focused on Meta and TikTok, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low. Nevertheless, as Apple is mentioned as one of the companies that removed TikTok from its app store, there might be a slight positive impact on Apple's stock if investors perceive the potential ban of TikTok as a benefit to Apple's ecosystem.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there are concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the impact of China on its market. On the other hand, there are potential positives such as the possibility of an AI partnership. The recent dip in stock price could make investors more cautious, but it also presents an opportunity for bullish sentiment if the earnings report beats expectations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
