      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which could indirectly affect Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. While the news may create some uncertainty around TikTok's future and its impact on digital advertising, it does not directly indicate any negative developments for Apple. However, the competitive landscape in social media and digital advertising could influence investor sentiment. Given that the news does not present any immediate threats to Apple's business model or financial performance, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investment in AI and its position as a key player in the AI landscape, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector and potential for volatility if earnings disappoint. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions potential risks like escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The positive aspects of AI investment and ecosystem growth are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and potential risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with 'Apple Intelligence' and its strong position among AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 also contributes to a negative sentiment. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating citing strong profit margins and future improvements. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting that while the AI initiative is positive, near-term market conditions and the slow adoption of Apple Intelligence could negatively impact the stock price in the short term. The article's focus on other AI stocks with potentially higher returns further dilutes the positive impact of Apple's AI efforts on its stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) significant investments in AI, positioning it as a key player in the AI landscape with innovations like Siri, on-device machine learning, and proprietary AI chips. The article also mentions Apple's inclusion in JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025, which could boost investor confidence. However, the report cautions about valuation discrepancies and potential earnings disappointments in the AI sector, which could lead to volatility. Given Apple's strong fundamentals, ecosystem growth, and AI-driven innovations, the positive sentiment likely outweighs the risks. The probability of a stock price rise is higher, but there is still a non-negligible chance of a fall due to broader market concerns about AI valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. However, it notes that historically, Berkshire's stock price has not reacted strongly to Apple's performance. The article also mentions that Berkshire's current valuation is not particularly attractive, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6, and that Warren Buffett has not been buying back shares, which could indicate that he does not see the stock as undervalued. Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising due to Apple's results is moderate, but not high. On the other hand, the probability of the stock price falling is also moderate, given that the article does not present overwhelmingly positive arguments for Berkshire's stock price to increase significantly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's efforts to promote Instagram by exploiting the potential ban of TikTok, a rival social media platform. The article highlights Meta's strategy of offering cash deals to creators to promote Instagram on other social media platforms. However, the article does not directly mention any impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Since the news is more focused on Meta and TikTok, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low. Nevertheless, as Apple is mentioned as one of the companies that removed TikTok from its app store, there might be a slight positive impact on Apple's stock if investors perceive the potential ban of TikTok as a benefit to Apple's ecosystem.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there are concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the impact of China on its market. On the other hand, there are potential positives such as the possibility of an AI partnership. The recent dip in stock price could make investors more cautious, but it also presents an opportunity for bullish sentiment if the earnings report beats expectations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which indirectly affects Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. While there is no direct negative impact on Apple from this news, the competitive landscape in social media and digital advertising could create some uncertainty. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a slight positive outlook for Apple due to its investments in AI and its strong market position. However, concerns about high valuations and potential volatility in the tech sector remain. Overall, the probabilities suggest a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI investments and its ranking as 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This is generally positive. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector, potential earnings disappointments, and escalating trade tensions between the US and China. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. The previous round predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the slightly positive news and the mixed previous predictions, I will lean slightly towards a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the headline emphasizes Apple's AI leadership, the article's content reveals a more nuanced picture.  A BofA analyst lowered the price target due to a weak macro environment and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple Intelligence.  The reduced iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens near-term prospects.  However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, highlighting strong profit margins and future potential.  The article also positions Apple as a strong contender in the AI race but suggests other AI stocks might offer quicker, higher returns.  Considering the mixed signals \u2013 a lowered price target alongside a 'Buy' rating, a weak macro environment, and the relatively slow rollout of Apple Intelligence \u2013 the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall in the short term.  The long-term outlook remains positive due to Apple's strong fundamentals and AI investments, but this is not reflected in the immediate impact of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) significant investments in AI, positioning it as a key player in the AI landscape with innovations like Siri, on-device machine learning, and proprietary AI chips.

The probability of a stock price rise is higher, but there is still a non-negligible chance of a fall due to broader market concerns about AI valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. However, as Apple is mentioned as one of the companies that removed TikTok from its app store, there might be a slight positive impact on Apple's stock if investors perceive the potential ban of TikTok as a benefit to Apple's ecosystem. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct implications for Apple, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Taking into account the mixed sentiments and the indirect impact of the news on Apple, the estimated probabilities are moderately balanced.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there are concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the impact of China on its market, leading to a potential guidance cut and a decline in stock price. On the other hand, there are potential positives such as the possibility of an AI partnership, which could boost investor confidence. The recent dip in stock price could make investors more cautious, but it also presents an opportunity for bullish sentiment if the earnings report beats expectations. The trend in previous predictions shows a range of opinions, with some predicting a rise and others a fall. Given the mixed signals and recent trends, the probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which indirectly affects Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. While there is no direct negative impact on Apple from this news, the competitive landscape in social media and digital advertising could create some uncertainty. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a slight positive outlook for Apple due to its investments in AI and its strong market position. However, concerns about high valuations and potential volatility in the tech sector remain. Overall, the probabilities suggest a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's increasing investments in AI and its position as a key player, ranking 6th on JPMorgan's list of important AI stocks for 2025. This is a positive signal. However, the article also mentions concerns about high valuations in the tech sector, potential earnings disappointments, and escalating trade tensions between the US and China. JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The previous round of predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive for Apple. Given the slightly positive news and the mixed previous predictions, I will lean slightly towards a rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The fact that JPMorgan identifies potential for higher returns in other AI stocks tempers the enthusiasm for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the headline emphasizes Apple's AI leadership and the article mentions its strong position in the AI market and the positive outlook from some analysts, several factors point towards a more cautious stance.  A BofA analyst lowered the price target due to a weak macro environment and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple Intelligence. The reduced iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens near-term prospects.  The article also highlights that other AI stocks might offer quicker, higher returns.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance. While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong due to its fundamentals and AI investments, the short-term impact of this news is likely to be negative or at best neutral.  The probability of a price rise is therefore lower than the probability of a fall, but not drastically so, given Apple's overall resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) significant investments in AI, positioning it as a key player in the AI landscape with innovations like Siri, on-device machine learning, and proprietary AI chips.

While Apple's results may indirectly affect Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in the company, the direct impact on Berkshire's stock price seems limited. Historically, Berkshire's stock price has not reacted strongly to Apple's performance. Given the moderate correlation between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances (0.49 over the past five years), and Berkshire's current valuation not being particularly attractive with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6, the probabilities of stock price movement seem relatively balanced. However, Berkshire's businesses generate reliable cash flow, and its diversified portfolio and massive cash stockpile could contribute to a stable outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which indirectly affects Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. While there is no direct negative impact on Apple from this news, the competitive landscape in social media and digital advertising could create some uncertainty. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct implications for Apple, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced.

JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The previous rounds of predictions are mixed, with a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Considering these factors, the news is moderately positive but tempered by significant risks and alternative investment opportunities. Therefore, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the considerable downside risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.
