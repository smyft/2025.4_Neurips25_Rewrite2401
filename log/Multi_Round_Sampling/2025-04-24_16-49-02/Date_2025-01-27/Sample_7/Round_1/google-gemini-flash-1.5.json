(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Unveiling Apple (AAPL) Q1 Outlook: Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics\nNews Content: The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Services' reaching $26.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' will reach $7.71 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' to reach $52.23 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross margin- Services' to come in at $19.36 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $16.84 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Apple have returned -12.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple, which is significant for Berkshire Hathaway due to its substantial stake in Apple. However, historical data shows that even when Apple reports strong results, Berkshire's stock price tends to react minimally. Given that Berkshire's valuation is currently considered high and there are concerns about its growth prospects, the likelihood of a significant rise in its stock price is low. Conversely, the potential for a decline exists if the market reacts negatively to Apple's results or if broader market conditions worsen. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook on Berkshire's stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall earnings season data is positive, Apple is specifically highlighted as a laggard within the Magnificent 7, having lost 15% of its value since its 52-week high. Concerns about China and its AI strategy are weighing on the stock. Analysts are projecting potentially lowered guidance. However, the article also mentions that some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate an AI partnership announcement soon, potentially with Baidu. The conflicting information makes it difficult to predict the stock's movement with high certainty. The negative sentiment and potential guidance cut suggest a higher probability of a price fall, but the potential AI partnership provides some upside potential. Given the recent negative trend and analyst concerns, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several key factors point towards a potential price decline.  The downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days (-1.1%) is a significant negative indicator, suggesting analyst pessimism.  Furthermore, the projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver of Apple's performance, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further reinforces the negative sentiment.  While some segments like Services show strong growth, the overall picture is tempered by the iPhone revenue decline and the downward revision of EPS estimates. The recent -12.8% share return also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, driven by a U.S. ban. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. Apple's revenue from iPhone sales is vast, and the secondary market for iPhones with TikTok does not significantly affect Apple's financials. However, the news could slightly boost sentiment around Apple's ecosystem strength. Conversely, if the ban leads to broader concerns about app availability or regulatory risks for tech companies, it might negatively impact sentiment. Overall, the effect is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. The article provides an overview of the expected earnings growth and revenue increases for each company. For Apple Inc., the article mentions a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues, with no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days. Additionally, the company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. However, the article also notes that Apple has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months, and has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.42 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news discusses how major companies are framing their Artificial Intelligence narratives during earnings calls. Since Apple is one of the companies mentioned, it implies that there might be updates or discussions around Apple's AI initiatives. Positive updates on AI can generally be seen as a positive catalyst for the stock price. However, without specific details about Apple's AI narrative, it's hard to gauge the exact impact. The market might react positively if the narrative is viewed favorably, or there could be no change if the narrative is neutral or already priced in.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
