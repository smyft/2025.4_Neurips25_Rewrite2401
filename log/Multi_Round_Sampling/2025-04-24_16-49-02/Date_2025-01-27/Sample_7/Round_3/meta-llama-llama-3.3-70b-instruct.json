(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 ETFs to Watch This Earnings Season\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple, which is significant for Berkshire Hathaway due to its substantial stake in Apple. However, historical data shows that even when Apple reports strong results, Berkshire's stock price tends to react minimally. Given that Berkshire's valuation is currently considered high and there are concerns about its growth prospects, the likelihood of a significant rise in its stock price is low. Conversely, the potential for a decline exists if the market reacts negatively to Apple's results or if broader market conditions worsen. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook on Berkshire's stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall earnings season data is positive, Apple is specifically highlighted as a laggard within the Magnificent 7, having lost 15% of its value since its 52-week high. Concerns about China and its AI strategy are weighing on the stock. Analysts are projecting potentially lowered guidance. However, the article also mentions that some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate an AI partnership announcement soon, potentially with Baidu. The conflicting information makes it difficult to predict the stock's movement with high certainty. The negative sentiment and potential guidance cut suggest a higher probability of a price fall, but the potential AI partnership provides some upside potential. Given the recent negative trend and analyst concerns, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several key factors point towards a potential price decline.  The downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days (-1.1%) is a significant negative indicator, suggesting analyst pessimism.  Furthermore, the projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver of Apple's performance, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further reinforces the negative sentiment.  While some segments like Services show strong growth, the overall picture is tempered by the iPhone revenue decline and the downward revision of EPS estimates. The recent -12.8% share return also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, driven by a U.S. ban. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. Apple's revenue from iPhone sales is vast, and the secondary market for iPhones with TikTok does not significantly affect Apple's financials. However, the news could slightly boost sentiment around Apple's ecosystem strength. Conversely, if the ban leads to broader concerns about app availability or regulatory risks for tech companies, it might negatively impact sentiment. Overall, the effect is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. The article provides an overview of the expected earnings growth and revenue increases for each company. For Apple Inc., the article mentions a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues, with no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days. Additionally, the company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. However, the article also notes that Apple has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months, and has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.42 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news discusses how major companies are framing their Artificial Intelligence narratives during earnings calls. Since Apple is one of the companies mentioned, it implies that there might be updates or discussions around Apple's AI initiatives. Positive updates on AI can generally be seen as a positive catalyst for the stock price. However, without specific details about Apple's AI narrative, it's hard to gauge the exact impact. The market might react positively if the narrative is viewed favorably, or there could be no change if the narrative is neutral or already priced in.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights the upcoming earnings report for Apple, which is significant for Berkshire Hathaway due to its substantial stake in Apple. Historical data shows that even when Apple reports strong results, Berkshire's stock price tends to react minimally. Given Berkshire's current high valuation and concerns about its growth prospects, the likelihood of a significant rise in its stock price is low. Additionally, the mixed outlook for Apple, with potential downward revisions and concerns about its performance, suggests a higher probability of a price fall for Berkshire. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price decline for Berkshire Hathaway in light of the upcoming Apple earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report and highlights several concerns: underperformance compared to other 'Magnificent 7' stocks, a 15% drop from its 52-week high, worries about China, and its AI strategy. Analysts are also projecting potentially lowered guidance, and EPS estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. Considering the recent negative trend and analyst concerns, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall. The previous rounds of predictions also show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price fall. Given the consistent concerns about China, AI strategy, and potential guidance cut, the probability of a price fall is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  The downward revision of EPS estimates (-1.1% in 30 days) indicates analyst pessimism. The projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, this is offset by the negative iPhone trend and EPS revision. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reinforces negative sentiment.  The recent -12.8% share return also reflects negative investor sentiment. While positive aspects exist (growth in Services, other product lines), the overall picture leans negative.  Previous model predictions are varied, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering the preponderance of negative indicators, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but the uncertainty warrants probabilities closer to 0.5 than extreme values.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, driven by a U.S. ban.

Apple's revenue from iPhone sales is vast, and the secondary market for iPhones with TikTok does not significantly affect Apple's financials.

While Apple is a key player in the AI industry, the article notes that the company's stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Additionally, Apple has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, and there are concerns about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple's AI-driven innovations, such as Siri and on-device machine learning, contribute to user retention within its ecosystem, driving demand for hardware and services. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the company's strong fundamentals and AI-driven innovations, but the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the potential guidance cut and iPhone revenue decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc.

However, the article also notes that Apple has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months, and has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the mixed outlook for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses AI in earnings calls and how major companies, including Apple, frame their AI narratives. While Apple has shown underperformance in the recent period and has weak sales guidance, the potential for positive AI-related updates could provide an upside. The mixed signals from different models indicate uncertainty. The latest round of predictions suggests a slightly higher chance of a stock price rise, possibly due to positive speculation around AI partnerships. However, given the overall cautious outlook and recent performance, the probability of a stock price rise is still moderate.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights the upcoming earnings report for Apple, which is significant for Berkshire Hathaway due to its substantial stake in Apple.

However, the uncertainty and potential for positive surprises around AI or other factors prevent assigning extremely high probabilities to either outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, driven by a U.S. ban. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. Apple's revenue from iPhone sales is vast, and the secondary market for iPhones with TikTok does not significantly affect Apple's financials.

Conversely, if the ban leads to broader concerns about app availability or regulatory risks for tech companies, it might negatively impact sentiment. Overall, the effect is likely neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a slight rise due to ecosystem strength, while others consider broader market concerns. Given the minimal direct financial impact and potential for positive sentiment, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's investments in AI and its potential impact on the company's stock price.

However, Apple's AI-driven innovations, such as Siri and on-device machine learning, contribute to user retention within its ecosystem, driving demand for hardware and services. The JPMorgan report highlights Apple's importance in the AI landscape and its potential for growth. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the company's strong fundamentals and AI-driven innovations, but the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the potential guidance cut and iPhone revenue decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc.
