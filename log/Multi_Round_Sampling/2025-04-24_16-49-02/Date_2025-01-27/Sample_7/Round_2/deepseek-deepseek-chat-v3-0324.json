(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple, which is significant for Berkshire Hathaway due to its substantial stake in Apple. However, historical data shows that even when Apple reports strong results, Berkshire's stock price tends to react minimally. Given that Berkshire's valuation is currently considered high and there are concerns about its growth prospects, the likelihood of a significant rise in its stock price is low. Conversely, the potential for a decline exists if the market reacts negatively to Apple's results or if broader market conditions worsen. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook on Berkshire's stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall earnings season data is positive, Apple is specifically highlighted as a laggard within the Magnificent 7, having lost 15% of its value since its 52-week high. Concerns about China and its AI strategy are weighing on the stock. Analysts are projecting potentially lowered guidance. However, the article also mentions that some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate an AI partnership announcement soon, potentially with Baidu. The conflicting information makes it difficult to predict the stock's movement with high certainty. The negative sentiment and potential guidance cut suggest a higher probability of a price fall, but the potential AI partnership provides some upside potential. Given the recent negative trend and analyst concerns, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several key factors point towards a potential price decline.  The downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days (-1.1%) is a significant negative indicator, suggesting analyst pessimism.  Furthermore, the projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver of Apple's performance, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further reinforces the negative sentiment.  While some segments like Services show strong growth, the overall picture is tempered by the iPhone revenue decline and the downward revision of EPS estimates. The recent -12.8% share return also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, driven by a U.S. ban. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. Apple's revenue from iPhone sales is vast, and the secondary market for iPhones with TikTok does not significantly affect Apple's financials. However, the news could slightly boost sentiment around Apple's ecosystem strength. Conversely, if the ban leads to broader concerns about app availability or regulatory risks for tech companies, it might negatively impact sentiment. Overall, the effect is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. The article provides an overview of the expected earnings growth and revenue increases for each company. For Apple Inc., the article mentions a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues, with no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days. Additionally, the company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. However, the article also notes that Apple has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months, and has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.42 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news discusses how major companies are framing their Artificial Intelligence narratives during earnings calls. Since Apple is one of the companies mentioned, it implies that there might be updates or discussions around Apple's AI initiatives. Positive updates on AI can generally be seen as a positive catalyst for the stock price. However, without specific details about Apple's AI narrative, it's hard to gauge the exact impact. The market might react positively if the narrative is viewed favorably, or there could be no change if the narrative is neutral or already priced in.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights the upcoming earnings report for Apple, which is significant for Berkshire Hathaway due to its substantial stake in Apple. Historical data shows that even when Apple reports strong results, Berkshire's stock price tends to react minimally. Given Berkshire's current high valuation and concerns about its growth prospects, the likelihood of a significant rise in its stock price is low. Additionally, the mixed outlook for Apple, with potential downward revisions and concerns about its performance, suggests a higher probability of a price fall for Berkshire. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price decline for Berkshire Hathaway in light of the upcoming Apple earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report and highlights several concerns: underperformance compared to other 'Magnificent 7' stocks, a 15% drop from its 52-week high, worries about China, and its AI strategy. Analysts are also projecting potentially lowered guidance, and EPS estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. Considering the recent negative trend and analyst concerns, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall. The previous rounds of predictions also show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price fall. Given the consistent concerns about China, AI strategy, and potential guidance cut, the probability of a price fall is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  The downward revision of EPS estimates (-1.1% in 30 days) indicates analyst pessimism. The projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, this is offset by the negative iPhone trend and EPS revision. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reinforces negative sentiment.  The recent -12.8% share return also reflects negative investor sentiment. While positive aspects exist (growth in Services, other product lines), the overall picture leans negative.  Previous model predictions are varied, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering the preponderance of negative indicators, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but the uncertainty warrants probabilities closer to 0.5 than extreme values.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, driven by a U.S. ban.

Conversely, if the ban leads to broader concerns about app availability or regulatory risks for tech companies, it might negatively impact sentiment. Overall, the effect is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's investments in AI and its potential impact on the company's stock price. While Apple is a key player in the AI industry, the article notes that the company's stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Additionally, Apple has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, and there are concerns about China and its AI strategy. However, Apple's AI-driven innovations, such as Siri and on-device machine learning, contribute to user retention within its ecosystem, driving demand for hardware and services. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the company's strong fundamentals and AI-driven innovations, but the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the potential guidance cut and iPhone revenue decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc.

However, the article also notes that Apple has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months, and has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the mixed outlook for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses AI in earnings calls and how major companies, including Apple, frame their AI narratives. While Apple has shown underperformance in the recent period and has weak sales guidance, the potential for positive AI-related updates could provide an upside. The mixed signals from different models indicate uncertainty. The latest round of predictions suggests a slightly higher chance of a stock price rise, possibly due to positive speculation around AI partnerships. However, given the overall cautious outlook and recent performance, the probability of a stock price rise is still moderate.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
