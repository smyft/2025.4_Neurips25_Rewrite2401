A whopping $19.4 billion, positioning Broadcom to keep rewarding investors while powering ahead.\n\nLooking forward, Broadcom is brimming with confidence, forecasting a 22% revenue jump in Q1 FY25 to $14.6 billion.

If you're looking for a leader in tech that knows how to navigate challenges and crush expectations, Broadcom's got your attention.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its core business operations. While Apple does use glass in its products, the headline suggests a focus on a different sector. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low, with a slight bias towards stability rather than volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is a stock Warren Buffett would hold 'practically forever.' This suggests a strong, long-term positive outlook on the company's fundamentals and future prospects. Buffett's endorsement is widely respected and often influences investor sentiment positively. While the article itself isn't provided, the headline alone implies a buy-and-hold recommendation, which typically leads to increased demand and potentially a rise in stock price. However, the impact might be limited as Apple is already a widely held and analyzed stock, so the news might be largely priced in. Therefore, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Glass Stocks\" is extremely generic and provides no specific information about Apple Inc.  There is no direct connection established between Apple and the potential investment in glass stocks.  Therefore, this news is unlikely to have any significant impact on Apple's stock price.  Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors and not this headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors are looking to earnings season to revive a faltering stock rally, especially since the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates as quickly as hoped. This implies that corporate earnings growth is now a critical factor for market performance. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), a strong earnings report could positively impact the stock price, while weak earnings could lead to a decline. Given Apple's historical performance and market position, there is a reasonable chance of positive earnings, but the uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions (e.g., interest rates) adds risk. Thus, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a rise due to investor optimism around earnings.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Broadcom's (AVGO) strong financial performance driven by AI demand, but it also mentions Apple (AAPL) as a key customer contributing to Broadcom's growth. However, the article does not provide specific information about Apple's financial performance or stock price movement. Given that the news is more directly related to Broadcom and its positive outlook, and does not contain negative information about Apple, we can infer that the news might have a neutral or slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price due to its association with a growing AI-related business. However, without direct implications for Apple's financials or operations, the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not provide any direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. However, Apple has been known to use glass in its products, such as iPhone screens. Investing in glass stocks could potentially benefit Apple if the company is planning to increase its use of glass in future products or if it has existing investments in glass manufacturers. Without more specific information, it's difficult to determine the impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be relatively low and evenly distributed.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a decline in iPhone market share in China, where Apple has seen significant competition from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi. Despite the global smartphone market showing signs of recovery, Apple's share in its core market has dipped. However, Apple's strong performance in non-core markets and the increasing focus on premium offerings could partly offset these declines. The overall tone of the news is mixed, with a slight negative bias towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not provide direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. While Apple uses glass in its products, the focus on glass stocks suggests a broader market trend rather than specific developments related to Apple. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning towards stability and others indicating slight positive or negative biases. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed sentiment from previous analyses, I estimate a balanced probability with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a strong positive sentiment towards Apple, as Warren Buffett's endorsement of a stock he'd hold 'practically forever' is a significant vote of confidence. This is likely to positively influence investor sentiment and potentially increase demand for the stock. Considering the previous round's predictions, there's a clear shift towards a more positive outlook compared to the 'glass stocks' headline. The models that correctly identified Apple in the Broadcom article also leaned towards a slightly positive or neutral impact. Given Buffett's influence and the positive connotation of the headline, I'm increasing the probability of a stock price rise. However, Apple is already a widely held stock, so the impact might be somewhat limited. Therefore, I will predict a higher probability of stock price rising than falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Glass Stocks\" is irrelevant to Apple's core business and unlikely to directly impact its stock price.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the lack of direct connection between the news and AAPL.  Some models incorrectly linked the headline to other unrelated news items (e.g., Broadcom's performance, overall market sentiment).  The consensus leans slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, but this is likely due to general market factors and not the provided headline.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this specific news is considered very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that corporate earnings growth is critical for sustaining the market rally, especially with the Fed unlikely to cut interest rates soon. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), this implies that its upcoming earnings report will be a significant driver of stock price movement. Historically, Apple has strong earnings performance, but macroeconomic uncertainties (e.g., interest rates) add risk. The previous predictions show a mix of optimism and caution, with some models leaning slightly positive due to Apple's market position and others neutral or slightly negative due to lack of direct relevance or mixed news. Considering the emphasis on earnings and Apple's track record, the probability of a rise is slightly higher, but the uncertainty keeps the probabilities balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its core business operations. While Apple does use glass in its products, the headline suggests a focus on a different sector. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a wide range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of it falling. However, most models agree that the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely minimal due to the lack of direct relevance. Considering the generic nature of the headline and the diverse opinions from other models, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling to be relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards stability.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China, where Apple faces stiff competition from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi. While the global smartphone market is recovering, Apple's core market share has dipped, which could negatively impact investor confidence. However, Apple's growth in non-core markets and increasing focus on premium offerings could partly offset these declines. The overall tone of the news is mixed, but the negative aspect of declining market share in China is significant.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not provide direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. While Apple uses glass in its products, the focus on glass stocks suggests a broader market trend rather than specific developments related to Apple. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning towards stability and others indicating slight positive or negative biases. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed sentiment from previous analyses, I estimate a balanced probability with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline is highly positive, indicating Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple. This is a strong signal that typically boosts investor sentiment. In the previous rounds, the models initially struggled with irrelevant headlines, but the model that correctly interpreted the Buffett headline gave a high probability of a price increase. Considering Buffett's influence and the positive nature of the headline, I expect a positive impact on the stock price. However, Apple is already a large and widely analyzed company, so the effect might be somewhat muted. Therefore, I predict a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so. I am also taking into account the trend of previous predictions, which shows an increase in the probability of stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Glass Stocks\" is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The headline provides no specific information about Apple or its performance.  While Apple uses glass in its products, this is a minor component of its overall business.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct connection between the news and AAPL. Some models incorrectly linked the headline to other unrelated news, highlighting the difficulty in drawing a causal link between this headline and Apple's stock price.  The consensus leans slightly towards a neutral outlook, but this is likely due to general market factors and not the provided headline. Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this specific news is considered very low.  The slight upward bias in some predictions likely reflects general market optimism or other unrelated news affecting Apple's stock price, not this specific headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally' suggests that corporate earnings growth is critical for sustaining the market, especially with the Fed unlikely to cut interest rates soon. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), this implies its upcoming earnings report will be a significant driver of stock price movement. Apple has historically strong earnings performance, but macroeconomic uncertainties add risk. Previous predictions show a mix of optimism and caution, with some models leaning slightly positive due to Apple's market position and others neutral or slightly negative due to lack of direct relevance or mixed news. Considering the emphasis on earnings and Apple's track record, the probability of a rise is slightly higher, but the uncertainty keeps the probabilities balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Broadcom's (AVGO) strong financial performance driven by AI demand and its positive impact on the stock market. However, it does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The article mentions Apple as a key customer contributing to Broadcom's growth, which could have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price due to its association with a growing AI-related business. Given the lack of direct implications for Apple's financials or operations and the positive outlook on Broadcom, which is a supplier to Apple, the news might have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models agree that the impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal due to the lack of direct relevance to its financial performance or operations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not directly relate to Apple Inc.

The overall tone of the news is mixed, but the negative aspect of declining market share in China is significant. Previous predictions showed a range of probabilities, with some models indicating a slight negative bias and others indicating mixed sentiments. Given these factors, the probabilities are estimated to be relatively balanced but with a slight negative bias.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not provide direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. While Apple uses glass in its products, the focus on glass stocks suggests a broader market trend rather than specific developments related to Apple. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning towards stability and others indicating slight positive or negative biases. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed sentiment from previous analyses, I estimate a balanced probability with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news headline \"Every Stock Warren Buffett Has Said He'd Own Practically Forever\" is a strong positive signal for Apple (AAPL). Warren Buffett's endorsement carries significant weight and typically boosts investor confidence. Analyzing the previous predictions, there's a clear trend towards increasing the probability of a stock price rise as models correctly interpret the positive implications of Buffett's endorsement. While Apple is already a widely held stock, the 'Buffett effect' can still lead to increased demand. Therefore, I predict a high probability of the stock price rising. However, I acknowledge that some models in previous rounds were misled by irrelevant headlines, and some models still focus on other factors. I am giving more weight to the models that correctly interpreted the Buffett headline and the trend of increasing positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Glass Stocks\" is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The headline provides no specific information about Apple or its performance. While Apple uses glass in its products, this is a minor component of its overall business.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct connection between the news and AAPL. Some models incorrectly linked the headline to other unrelated news, highlighting the difficulty in drawing a causal link between this headline and Apple's stock price.  However, there's a recurring theme of some models interpreting other news (like Warren Buffett's supposed endorsement or Apple's performance relative to competitors in China) and incorporating that into their predictions.  To avoid this bias, I'm focusing solely on the irrelevance of the given headline.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this specific news is considered very low, with a slight lean towards no change reflecting the overall market neutrality implied by the lack of relevant information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally' suggests that corporate earnings growth is critical for sustaining the market, especially with the Fed unlikely to cut interest rates soon. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), this implies its upcoming earnings report will be a significant driver of stock price movement.

While the news does not directly relate to Apple's financial performance or operations, it highlights Apple's involvement in a growing AI-related business. This association could have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the lack of direct implications for Apple's financials or operations means the impact is likely to be minimal. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models agree that the impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal due to the lack of direct relevance to its financial performance or operations. Considering the positive outlook on Broadcom and Apple's role as a key customer, there is a slight bias towards a positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not provide direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of it falling. However, most models agree that the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely minimal due to the lack of direct relevance. Considering the generic nature of the headline and the diverse opinions from other models, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling to be relatively balanced. Since there is no strong indication of a significant positive or negative impact, the probabilities should be close to equal, but given the slight negative bias observed in some predictions and the lack of direct positive news, a slight inclination towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook is reasonable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China, where Apple faces stiff competition from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi. While the global smartphone market is recovering, Apple's core market share has dipped, which could negatively impact investor confidence. However, Apple's growth in non-core markets and increasing focus on premium offerings could partly offset these declines. The overall tone of the news is mixed, but the negative aspect of declining market share in China is significant. Previous predictions showed a range of probabilities, with some models indicating a slight negative bias and others indicating mixed sentiments. Given these factors, the probabilities are estimated to be relatively balanced but with a slight negative bias.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
