(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, which is a significant market for the company. Although Apple is experiencing growth in non-core markets, the overall decline in market share and the rise of competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi could negatively impact investor sentiment. The slight decrease in market share from 19% to 18% may suggest a trend that could continue, leading to concerns about future revenue. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's (AVGO) strong performance and future prospects, driven by the AI boom. While the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as a source of growing demand for Broadcom's ASICs, it doesn't directly provide information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. The positive news for Broadcom could indirectly benefit Apple if Broadcom's success translates to better components or services for Apple products, but this is not explicitly stated or quantified. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Given the indirect nature of the impact, the probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price is relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's iPhone market share decline in China, a significant market, is a negative factor.  However, this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models.  The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple's continued dominance in revenue (projected 89-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) suggests resilience.  The Chinese government's subsidies favoring domestic brands pose a threat, but Apple's premium positioning and brand loyalty could mitigate this impact.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so, as the overall picture isn't overwhelmingly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Warren Buffett, a highly respected investor, has indicated a long-term commitment to holding Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Buffett's endorsement is generally seen as a strong vote of confidence in a company's stability and growth potential. This could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL stock, potentially driving the price up. However, the headline alone does not provide new financial data or specific developments about Apple, so the impact may be moderate. The probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling due to the positive sentiment associated with Buffett's long-term holding strategy.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' and the content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide specific information that could influence its stock price. The news seems to be about a general topic of investing in glass stocks, which does not directly mention Apple or any specific event that could impact its stock price. Therefore, based on the information given, it's reasonable to assume that the news might not have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not provide any direct information about Apple Inc.'s performance, financials, or future prospects. However, it could be related to Apple's potential investments or partnerships in glass technology, which might be relevant to their product development, such as glass screens for iPhones or other devices. Without more specific information, it's challenging to determine the impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance and specific details, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards a neutral or minimal impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in iPhone market share in China, where Apple has seen significant competition from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi. Despite growth in other regions, the decline in a key market like China can have a negative impact on investor sentiment. However, the premium offerings and generative AI capabilities in the pipeline could act as a buffer to some extent.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market for the company, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Although Apple is experiencing growth in non-core markets and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models, the overall decline in market share and the rise of competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are concerning. The slight decrease in market share from 19% to 18% suggests a potential ongoing trend that could affect future revenue. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's (AVGO) strong AI-driven growth and positive outlook, with specific mentions of Apple (AAPL) as a customer contributing to this growth. While the news is primarily about Broadcom, the explicit mention of Apple as a source of demand for Broadcom's ASICs suggests a positive, albeit indirect, impact on Apple. Broadcom's success in AI and its ability to secure large contracts from major players like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, along with Apple, indicates a healthy ecosystem and potential for continued growth for all involved. The previous rounds show varied opinions, with some focusing on negative news about Apple's market share in China. However, this news provides a counterpoint, highlighting Apple's involvement in the AI boom through its partnership with Broadcom. Given the positive sentiment surrounding AI and Apple's participation in it, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's declining market share in China, a crucial market, is a significant negative factor.  While growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models offer some offsetting positives, the overall impact leans negative. The Chinese government's support for domestic brands further exacerbates this concern.  Although Apple maintains a strong revenue projection from iPhones, the market share decline suggests potential future revenue stagnation or even decline.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight tendency towards a price fall. Considering the mixed signals, but giving more weight to the negative factors of market share loss in a key market and government support for competitors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Warren Buffett, a highly respected investor, has indicated a long-term commitment to holding Apple Inc.

This could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL stock, potentially driving the price up. However, the headline alone does not provide new financial data or specific developments about Apple, so the impact may be moderate. The probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling due to the positive sentiment associated with Buffett's long-term holding strategy. Previous predictions show mixed opinions, with some models leaning towards a negative impact due to market share declines in China, while others highlight the positive influence of Buffett's endorsement. Considering the weight of Buffett's reputation and the lack of direct negative news, the probability of a price rise is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide specific information that could influence its stock price. The news seems to be about a general topic of investing in glass stocks, which does not directly mention Apple or any specific event that could impact its stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance and specific details, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be relatively balanced. However, considering the neutral to slightly positive sentiment from some previous predictions and the lack of negative information, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not provide any direct information about Apple Inc.'s performance, financials, or future prospects. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a mixed sentiment. Some models have considered the news as neutral or slightly positive, while others have taken into account the decline in iPhone market share in China and the rise of competitors. Given the lack of direct relevance and specific details in the news, and considering the mixed signals from previous predictions, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be relatively balanced. However, since the news does not directly relate to Apple or provide negative information, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly lower than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, where local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi have gained momentum. While Apple continues to perform well in non-core markets and shows potential with their premium offerings, the core market decline in China is a concerning factor. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and future revenue projections, particularly because China is a significant market for Apple. Other models predict mixed sentiments with a lean towards stock price falling due to these factors. Considering these points, the overall probability leans towards the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market for the company, which raises concerns about future revenue and investor sentiment. Although Apple is experiencing growth in non-core markets and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models, the overall decline in market share and the rise of competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are significant negative factors. The slight decrease in market share from 19% to 18% suggests a potential ongoing trend that could affect future revenue. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's strong AI-driven growth, with Apple mentioned as a customer.

However, this news provides a counterpoint, highlighting Apple's involvement in the AI boom through its partnership with Broadcom. Given the positive sentiment surrounding AI and Apple's participation in it, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. However, the impact is indirect, so the rise won't be dramatic.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  A decline in Chinese market share is a significant negative, especially given the Chinese government's support for domestic brands. This is compounded by the previous predictions which largely lean towards a price fall due to this factor. However, several mitigating factors exist: growth in other markets, a shift towards higher-margin Pro models, and the overall growth of the global smartphone market.  The projection of iPhones accounting for a large percentage of Apple's revenue in 2025 suggests continued strength.  While the negative news regarding China is impactful, the positive factors and the overall resilience of Apple's business model prevent a drastically negative outlook.  Considering the previous predictions and the mixed nature of the news, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is warranted, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Warren Buffett, a highly respected investor, has expressed a long-term commitment to holding Apple Inc.

(AAPL) or provide specific information that could influence its stock price. However, considering previous predictions and the general trend of mixed sentiments with a slight inclination towards negative factors due to market share declines in China and competition, but also positive factors such as growth in other regions and AI-driven prospects, the probabilities seem to balance out. Given the lack of direct relevance and specific details in the news, and taking into account the mixed signals from previous predictions, it's reasonable to assume a relatively balanced impact with a slight bias towards a positive outlook due to the general positive sentiment in the tech industry and Apple's strong position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' does not directly relate to Apple Inc.
