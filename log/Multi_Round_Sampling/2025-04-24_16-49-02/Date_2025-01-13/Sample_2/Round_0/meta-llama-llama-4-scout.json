Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the stock market, its stock price movement is likely to be influenced by overall market sentiment and expectations around earnings season. However, the news does not provide specific information about Apple's earnings prospects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is more closely tied to general market conditions and investor sentiment rather than company-specific news. Assuming that strong earnings reports could revive the market rally, there is a cautiously optimistic outlook, but it's not significantly skewed towards a rise or fall without specific earnings guidance.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45,\n}\n```"
