(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in global smartphone market share, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The decline in market share from 19% to 18% and mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series suggest potential challenges for Apple. However, the company is expanding in emerging markets and seeing rising demand for its Pro models in China, which could mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the combination of losing market share and mixed product reviews leads to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is likely among the stocks Warren Buffett would hold 'practically forever.' This suggests a strong, long-term positive outlook for the company, implying confidence in its business model, management, and future prospects. While the headline doesn't guarantee immediate price movement, it reinforces a positive sentiment that could attract investors and support the stock price. However, the impact might be limited as Buffett's long-term view is already well-known and likely priced into the stock to some extent. The market's overall condition and other company-specific news will also play a significant role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's iPhone market share decline in China, a significant market, is a negative factor.  However, this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models.  The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple's continued dominance in revenue (projected 89-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) suggests resilience.  The Chinese government's subsidies for domestic brands pose a threat, but Apple's premium positioning and brand loyalty could mitigate this impact.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so, as the overall picture isn't overwhelmingly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the global smartphone market share to Samsung, with a slight decline from 19% to 18%. This could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, there are positive aspects such as rising demand for Pro and Pro Max variants in China, potential sales growth in Q4 2024, and expansion in emerging markets. The mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features might weigh on the stock, but discounts in China could help maintain competitiveness. Overall, the negative sentiment from losing market share might slightly outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Broadcom's (AVGO) impressive fiscal 2024 results, with a 44% revenue increase and a 220% jump in AI revenue. The company also announced an 11% quarterly dividend hike and forecasts a 22% revenue jump in Q1 FY25. While the article does mention potential risks tied to a key customer, the overall tone is bullish, with Citi analysts setting a $220 price target. Although the article is about Broadcom, it mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of the companies driving demand for Broadcom's products, particularly in the AI sector. Given the positive sentiment and growth prospects, it is likely that Apple's stock price will also be positively affected, albeit indirectly. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's investment strategy, suggesting stocks he would hold indefinitely. However, it does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). Warren Buffett is known for his long-term investment strategy and has previously invested in Apple, but without specific mention of AAPL in the headline, the direct impact on AAPL's stock price is uncertain. The indirect impact could be positive if investors perceive this list as a validation of Apple's long-term prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in global smartphone market share, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The decline from 19% to 18% market share, coupled with mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series, suggests potential challenges for Apple. However, the company is expanding in emerging markets and seeing rising demand for its Pro models in China, which could mitigate some negative impacts. The overall sentiment is mixed, but the loss of market share and product issues weigh more heavily, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive long-term outlook for Apple, as it implies Warren Buffett would consider owning the stock 'practically forever.' This endorsement, even if indirect, can boost investor confidence. However, the impact might be limited because Buffett's investment philosophy is already well-known and likely factored into the stock price. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mix of opinions, with some models focusing on market share decline and others on growth potential. The overall sentiment seems slightly tilted towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Given this, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the news is more of a reaffirmation than a new catalyst.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  A decline in Chinese market share is a significant negative, especially given China's importance.  However, this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models. The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple's continued dominance in revenue (projected 89-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) suggests resilience.  The Chinese government subsidies for domestic brands are a threat, but Apple's premium positioning and brand loyalty could mitigate this.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for the negative news to outweigh the positive in the short term, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall.  However, the long-term prospects remain strong, suggesting the impact might be temporary.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in global smartphone market share, with a decline from 19% to 18%, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features further add to potential challenges. However, Apple is seeing rising demand for its Pro models in China and expanding in emerging markets, which could provide some offset. Considering the overall negative sentiment from losing market share and mixed product reviews, the probability of a stock price decline is slightly higher than an increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its stock performance. However, considering the overall market conditions and the importance of corporate earnings growth in the current economic environment, investors are likely to focus on companies with strong growth prospects and resilient business models. Apple's recent performance and the mixed reviews of its iPhone 16 series suggest a cautious outlook. Given that the news does not directly reference Apple or its stock performance, and without specific company-related data, the market's expectation and previous rounds' predictions should be considered. The general trend from previous predictions seems to lean towards a cautious or slightly negative outlook due to mixed signals about market share and product reception.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Broadcom's impressive fiscal 2024 results and its growth prospects, particularly in the AI sector. Although the article is about Broadcom, it mentions Apple as one of the companies driving demand for Broadcom's products, which could have a positive indirect impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the positive sentiment and growth prospects, as well as the potential indirect benefits to Apple, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is higher than the probability of it falling. However, the impact on Apple is indirect, and the article's primary focus is on Broadcom's performance, which means the effect on Apple's stock might be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline suggests that Apple is included in the list of stocks Warren Buffett would own practically forever. This implies a strong, long-term positive outlook for the company, reinforcing investor confidence in its business model, management, and future prospects. While this positive sentiment might attract investors, the impact could be somewhat limited as Buffett's long-term view is already well-known and possibly priced into the stock. However, considering the mixed signals from previous rounds of predictions and the broader market conditions, the overall sentiment appears more balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in global smartphone market share, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The decline from 19% to 18% market share, coupled with mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series, suggests potential challenges for Apple. However, there are positive aspects such as rising demand for Pro models in China and expansion in emerging markets. The overall sentiment is mixed, but the loss of market share and product issues weigh more heavily, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. Considering the previous predictions and the mixed signals, I estimate a probability of 0.4 for a price rise and 0.6 for a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive long-term outlook for Apple, as it implies Warren Buffett would consider owning the stock 'practically forever.'

The overall sentiment seems slightly tilted towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Given this, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the news is more of a reaffirmation than a new catalyst. Also, the previous round shows a trend of increasing probability of stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  A decline in Chinese market share is a significant negative, but this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models.

Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals and the potential for the negative news to outweigh the positive in the short term, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall. However, the long-term prospects remain strong, suggesting the impact might be temporary.  The fact that the market share decline is only 1 percentage point also suggests the impact might be less severe than initially feared.  The consensus from previous models leans towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, which I will adjust slightly to reflect the relatively small market share drop.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the global smartphone market share to Samsung, with a slight decline from 19% to 18%.

Overall, the negative sentiment from losing market share might slightly outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally' suggests a cautious market environment where corporate earnings growth is critical. Apple's recent performance, including a decline in global smartphone market share from 19% to 18%, mixed reviews for the iPhone16 series, and rising demand for Pro models in China, presents a mixed picture. Previous predictions indicate a range of opinions, with some focusing on market share decline and others on growth potential. Considering the importance of earnings season and the mixed signals about Apple's market position and product reception, the overall sentiment seems slightly negative. However, the long-term outlook remains positive due to Apple's strong business model and growth prospects. Given this, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be slightly lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Broadcom's impressive fiscal 2024 results, with a 44% revenue increase and a 220% jump in AI revenue.

While this positive sentiment might attract investors, the impact could be somewhat limited as Buffett's long-term view is already well-known and possibly priced into the stock. However, considering the mixed signals from previous rounds of predictions and the broader market conditions, the overall sentiment appears more balanced.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in global smartphone market share, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The decline from 19% to 18% market share, coupled with mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series, suggests potential challenges for Apple. However, there are positive aspects such as rising demand for Pro models in China and expansion in emerging markets. The overall sentiment is mixed, but the loss of market share and product issues weigh more heavily, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. Considering the previous predictions and the mixed signals, I estimate a probability of 0.4 for a price rise and 0.6 for a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, while positive, is indirect. It suggests Apple is a stock Warren Buffett *might* hold forever, which is a positive sentiment but not a direct endorsement. The previous rounds show a mixed bag of opinions, with some models focusing on market share decline and others on growth potential. There's a slight trend towards a more balanced outlook in the later rounds. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the mixed signals from previous analyses, I'll slightly favor a price rise, but not significantly. The market has likely already priced in Buffett's general positive view of Apple. The market share decline is a concern, but the growth in Pro models and emerging markets provides some offset. The previous round shows a trend of increasing probability of stock price rising, so I will follow this trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. A decline in Chinese market share is a significant negative, but this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models. The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple's continued dominance in revenue (projected 89-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) suggests resilience.

However, the long-term prospects remain strong, suggesting the impact might be temporary. The fact that the market share decline is only 1 percentage point also suggests the impact might be less severe than initially feared.  The consensus from previous models leans towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, which I will adjust slightly to reflect the relatively small market share drop and the overall strong long-term prospects.  The indirect positive news regarding Broadcom's success, which is partly driven by Apple's demand, also adds a small positive factor.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the global smartphone market share to Samsung, with a slight decline from 19% to 18%.
