(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in global smartphone market share, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The decline in market share from 19% to 18% and mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series suggest potential challenges for Apple. However, the company is expanding in emerging markets and seeing rising demand for its Pro models in China, which could mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the combination of losing market share and mixed product reviews leads to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is likely among the stocks Warren Buffett would hold 'practically forever.' This suggests a strong, long-term positive outlook for the company, implying confidence in its business model, management, and future prospects. While the headline doesn't guarantee immediate price movement, it reinforces a positive sentiment that could attract investors and support the stock price. However, the impact might be limited as Buffett's long-term view is already well-known and likely priced into the stock to some extent. The market's overall condition and other company-specific news will also play a significant role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's iPhone market share decline in China, a significant market, is a negative factor.  However, this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models.  The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple's continued dominance in revenue (projected 89-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) suggests resilience.  The Chinese government's subsidies for domestic brands pose a threat, but Apple's premium positioning and brand loyalty could mitigate this impact.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so, as the overall picture isn't overwhelmingly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the global smartphone market share to Samsung, with a slight decline from 19% to 18%. This could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, there are positive aspects such as rising demand for Pro and Pro Max variants in China, potential sales growth in Q4 2024, and expansion in emerging markets. The mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features might weigh on the stock, but discounts in China could help maintain competitiveness. Overall, the negative sentiment from losing market share might slightly outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Broadcom's (AVGO) impressive fiscal 2024 results, with a 44% revenue increase and a 220% jump in AI revenue. The company also announced an 11% quarterly dividend hike and forecasts a 22% revenue jump in Q1 FY25. While the article does mention potential risks tied to a key customer, the overall tone is bullish, with Citi analysts setting a $220 price target. Although the article is about Broadcom, it mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of the companies driving demand for Broadcom's products, particularly in the AI sector. Given the positive sentiment and growth prospects, it is likely that Apple's stock price will also be positively affected, albeit indirectly. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's investment strategy, suggesting stocks he would hold indefinitely. However, it does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). Warren Buffett is known for his long-term investment strategy and has previously invested in Apple, but without specific mention of AAPL in the headline, the direct impact on AAPL's stock price is uncertain. The indirect impact could be positive if investors perceive this list as a validation of Apple's long-term prospects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
