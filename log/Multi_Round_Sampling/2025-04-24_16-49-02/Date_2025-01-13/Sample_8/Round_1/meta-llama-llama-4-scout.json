(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions 'Investing in Glass Stocks,' which does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its core business. Without specific information linking Apple to the glass industry or any significant developments that would impact its stock, the news is unlikely to have a direct effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling remain relatively neutral, with a slight bias towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Losing the top spot in global smartphone market share to Samsung is a negative indicator, especially with Samsung's S24 series performing well, particularly in key markets like Europe and the US. The mixed reviews and delays surrounding Apple Intelligence for the iPhone 16 are also concerning. However, Apple is showing growth in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and demand for Pro models remains strong in China. The overall smartphone market is also growing, which is a positive sign. The discounts in China suggest Apple is fighting to maintain market share, which could impact profit margins. Considering these factors, the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Broadcom's (AVGO) strong performance and future outlook driven by AI.  While the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as a beneficiary of Broadcom's AI-related growth, the connection is indirect.  Apple's stock price movement is not directly tied to Broadcom's success in this instance. The news is positive for Broadcom, but the impact on Apple is likely to be minimal and indirect.  Any price movement in AAPL would be due to other factors, not directly related to this news about Broadcom. Therefore, the probabilities of a price rise or fall for Apple are close to the baseline probability based on general market conditions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the global smartphone market share to Samsung, with a slight decline from 19% to 18%. This could negatively impact investor sentiment as it suggests competitive pressures and potential challenges in maintaining growth. However, there are positive aspects such as rising demand for Pro and Pro Max variants in China, expansion in emerging markets, and a general improvement in global smartphone sales. The mixed reviews on the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features might weigh on the stock, but discounts in China could help sustain market share. Overall, the negative sentiment from losing market leadership might outweigh the positives in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China has declined in 2024, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum. This decline in market share, particularly in a significant market like China, could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor sentiment. However, it's worth noting that Apple continues to grow in non-core markets and that the iPhone's premium offerings are still in demand. Despite this, the immediate reaction to the news is likely to be negative due to concerns about market share erosion.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market, with Samsung taking the lead. However, Apple is still performing well in certain regions such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and is taking steps to maintain its market share in China. The mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features may negatively impact the stock price. On the other hand, the overall improvement in global smartphone sales and consumer sentiment could have a positive effect. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that investors are looking towards earnings season to potentially boost the stock price amid a faltering stock rally. With the expectation that the Fed might not cut interest rates as quickly as hoped, the focus shifts to corporate earnings growth. If Apple's earnings show strong growth, it could positively impact the stock price. However, if earnings do not meet expectations, the stock price might face downward pressure.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
