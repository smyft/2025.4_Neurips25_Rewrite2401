While the headline does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significant holdings in Apple. If investors perceive that one of the stocks Buffett would 'own practically forever' is AAPL, it could boost investor confidence in AAPL, potentially leading to a stock price increase. Given the positive sentiment typically associated with Buffett's investment decisions, I estimate the probability of AAPL's stock price rising due to this news as 0.6. Conversely, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated as 0.4, assuming some investors might sell based on profit-taking or other market dynamics.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Every Stock Warren Buffett Has Said He'd Own Practically Forever\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
