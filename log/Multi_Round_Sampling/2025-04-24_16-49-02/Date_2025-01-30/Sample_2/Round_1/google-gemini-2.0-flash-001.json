A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets, particularly India and the Middle East, which could indicate a strategic shift to offset potential declines in China. This could be seen positively by investors, as it suggests growth opportunities in new markets. However, the overall market sentiment and external factors could still influence stock price movement. Given the positive outlook on emerging markets, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight several factors influencing Apple's stock price. Firstly, Apple is releasing its quarterly earnings report. The market's reaction will depend on whether the earnings meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Secondly, the release of Q4 GDP data, expected to show slowing growth, could negatively impact market sentiment and potentially affect Apple's stock. However, the overall impact is difficult to predict without knowing the actual earnings figures. Given the mixed signals (earnings release vs. slowing GDP), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise if earnings are positive and a slightly lower probability if earnings are negative. Since the news doesn't give any indication of whether the earnings will be positive or negative, I will assume a neutral stance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings slightly beat expectations, with both revenue and EPS exceeding consensus estimates. However, a closer look at the key metrics reveals a mixed bag. While Services revenue showed strong growth (+13.9% YoY), and some product lines like Mac and iPad performed well, iPhone sales were slightly below expectations and other segments like Wearables underperformed.  Geographic revenue showed varied performance across regions, with some exceeding expectations (Europe, Japan) and others falling short (Greater China). The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests a negative outlook.  Considering the mixed performance and the negative Zacks rating, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall beat on earnings and revenue is slightly positive. The recent -4.4% return over the past month also contributes to a pessimistic outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, which is a positive indicator for the company's performance. The introduction of Apple Intelligence and its features has been well-received, potentially boosting user engagement and satisfaction. However, the article also mentions concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups and a general sell-off in tech stocks by hedge funds, which could introduce volatility. Despite this, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, citing strong financials and growth potential. The mixed signals suggest a balanced view, but the positive revenue growth and successful AI integration likely outweigh the negative aspects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, which could have a significant impact on its stock price. The fact that Apple is releasing its quarterly earnings results could lead to increased volatility in its stock price. However, the news article does not provide any specific information that would suggest a significant beat or miss in earnings, nor does it mention any other company-specific developments that could influence investor sentiment. Given that the article simply lists Apple's earnings report alongside other companies' reports and economic data releases without providing any negative or positive insights specific to Apple, it's reasonable to assume that the earnings report could potentially have a positive impact if it meets or exceeds expectations, or a negative impact if it disappoints. The probability of the stock price rising or falling is thus largely dependent on the earnings report's content and how it compares to market expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. Despite the tech sector selloff, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, citing strong financials and the potential for new competitors to emerge. Hedge funds have reduced their positions in technology stocks, but some have maintained long positions, indicating confidence in future AI-driven growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Warren Buffett, who is generally seen as a wise investor, has a significant portion of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio tied up in two leading AI stocks. This suggests a strong confidence in the potential growth of these AI-related companies. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is known for its advancements in technology, including AI, it might be inferred that Apple could benefit from this trend. However, since the specific mention is about two leading AI stocks and not explicitly about Apple, the impact on AAPL's stock price may not be as direct.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This creates a mixed outlook. The earnings report is the most direct influence; a positive surprise would likely drive the stock up, while a miss would push it down. The GDP data introduces macroeconomic uncertainty. A slower-than-expected GDP growth could dampen overall market sentiment, potentially negatively impacting Apple. The home sales data is less directly relevant to Apple but could still contribute to overall market sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of specific information about Apple's expected earnings, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise if earnings are positive and a slightly lower probability if earnings are negative.
