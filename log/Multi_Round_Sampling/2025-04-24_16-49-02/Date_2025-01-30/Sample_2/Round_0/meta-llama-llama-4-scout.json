The fact that Apple is releasing its quarterly earnings results could lead to increased volatility in its stock price. However, the news article does not provide any specific information that would suggest a significant beat or miss in earnings, nor does it mention any other company-specific developments that could influence investor sentiment. Given that the article simply lists Apple's earnings report alongside other companies' reports and economic data releases without providing any negative or positive insights specific to Apple, it's reasonable to assume that the earnings report could potentially have a positive impact if it meets or exceeds expectations, or a negative impact if it disappoints. The probability of the stock price rising or falling is thus largely dependent on the earnings report's content and how it compares to market expectations.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple earnings, Q4 GDP data, home sales: What to Watch\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
