(AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Dan Niles: Apple (AAPL) Bulls \u2018Trying to Pretend\u2019 an Upgrade Cycle is Coming\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's focus on emerging markets, particularly India and the Middle East, which could indicate a strategic shift to offset potential declines in China. This could be seen positively by investors, as it suggests growth opportunities in new markets. However, the overall market sentiment and external factors could still influence stock price movement. Given the positive outlook on emerging markets, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight several factors influencing Apple's stock price. Firstly, Apple is releasing its quarterly earnings report. The market's reaction will depend on whether the earnings meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Secondly, the release of Q4 GDP data, expected to show slowing growth, could negatively impact market sentiment and potentially affect Apple's stock. However, the overall impact is difficult to predict without knowing the actual earnings figures. Given the mixed signals (earnings release vs. slowing GDP), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise if earnings are positive and a slightly lower probability if earnings are negative. Since the news doesn't give any indication of whether the earnings will be positive or negative, I will assume a neutral stance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings slightly beat expectations, with both revenue and EPS exceeding consensus estimates. However, a closer look at the key metrics reveals a mixed bag. While Services revenue showed strong growth (+13.9% YoY), and some product lines like Mac and iPad performed well, iPhone sales were slightly below expectations and other segments like Wearables underperformed.  Geographic revenue showed varied performance across regions, with some exceeding expectations (Europe, Japan) and others falling short (Greater China). The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests a negative outlook.  Considering the mixed performance and the negative Zacks rating, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall beat on earnings and revenue is slightly positive. The recent -4.4% return over the past month also contributes to a pessimistic outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, which is a positive indicator for the company's performance. The introduction of Apple Intelligence and its features has been well-received, potentially boosting user engagement and satisfaction. However, the article also mentions concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups and a general sell-off in tech stocks by hedge funds, which could introduce volatility. Despite this, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, citing strong financials and growth potential. The mixed signals suggest a balanced view, but the positive revenue growth and successful AI integration likely outweigh the negative aspects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, which could have a significant impact on its stock price. The fact that Apple is releasing its quarterly earnings results could lead to increased volatility in its stock price. However, the news article does not provide any specific information that would suggest a significant beat or miss in earnings, nor does it mention any other company-specific developments that could influence investor sentiment. Given that the article simply lists Apple's earnings report alongside other companies' reports and economic data releases without providing any negative or positive insights specific to Apple, it's reasonable to assume that the earnings report could potentially have a positive impact if it meets or exceeds expectations, or a negative impact if it disappoints. The probability of the stock price rising or falling is thus largely dependent on the earnings report's content and how it compares to market expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article reports Apple's 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. Despite the tech sector selloff, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, citing strong financials and the potential for new competitors to emerge. Hedge funds have reduced their positions in technology stocks, but some have maintained long positions, indicating confidence in future AI-driven growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Warren Buffett, who is generally seen as a wise investor, has a significant portion of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio tied up in two leading AI stocks. This suggests a strong confidence in the potential growth of these AI-related companies. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is known for its advancements in technology, including AI, it might be inferred that Apple could benefit from this trend. However, since the specific mention is about two leading AI stocks and not explicitly about Apple, the impact on AAPL's stock price may not be as direct.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic focus on emerging markets, particularly India and the Middle East, which could be seen as a positive move to offset potential declines in China. This suggests growth opportunities that may attract investor interest. However, the mixed performance in previous earnings reports, particularly with iPhone sales underperforming, introduces some uncertainty. Given the overall positive sentiment towards emerging markets and the potential for growth, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise, while still acknowledging the risks that could lead to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings release alongside other major companies and key economic data (GDP, home sales). This creates a mixed outlook. The earnings report is the most direct influence; a positive surprise would likely drive the stock up, while a miss would push it down. The GDP data introduces macroeconomic uncertainty. A slower-than-expected GDP growth could dampen overall market sentiment, potentially negatively impacting Apple. The home sales data is less directly relevant to Apple but could still contribute to overall market sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of specific information about Apple's expected earnings, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise if earnings are positive and a slightly lower probability if earnings are negative. Given the previous rounds' predictions, there is a trend of positive predictions, which may indicate that there are some positive information about the stock price. Therefore, I will give a slightly higher probability of stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings slightly beat expectations, but the picture is mixed. While EPS and revenue exceeded estimates, key metrics show uneven performance. Services revenue grew strongly (+13.9% YoY), and Mac and iPad sales performed well. However, iPhone sales were slightly below expectations, and Wearables underperformed. Geographic revenue varied, with some regions exceeding and others falling short of estimates. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating suggests a negative near-term outlook.  The recent negative stock performance (-4.4% over the past month) also contributes to a pessimistic outlook. While the earnings beat is positive, the mixed performance across segments and the negative Zacks rating outweigh the positive aspects.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to potential growth in emerging markets and AI integration, while others are more pessimistic due to the mixed earnings report and negative Zacks rating.  I'm weighting the more cautious predictions more heavily due to the concrete data presented in the earnings report itself, which reveals a less optimistic picture than the overall beat might suggest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, which is a positive indicator for the company's performance.

This suggests growth opportunities that may attract investor interest. However, the mixed performance in previous earnings reports, particularly with iPhone sales underperforming, introduces some uncertainty. The overall sentiment from previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of stock price rise due to the potential for growth in emerging markets, despite the mixed signals from earnings performance.

Considering the mixed signals and the lack of specific information about Apple's expected earnings, and given the trend of positive predictions in previous rounds, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, assuming the earnings are positive. However, the slowing GDP growth could negatively impact market sentiment, so I will adjust the probability slightly downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings slightly beat expectations, but the results present a mixed picture.

Considering the mixed performance, the negative Zacks rating, and the recent negative stock performance, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall. However, the slight beat on earnings and revenue, coupled with the positive sentiment expressed by some models regarding emerging markets and AI, prevents a completely pessimistic outlook.  The overall trend in previous predictions leans slightly towards a price rise, but I'm giving more weight to the concrete data from the earnings report itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, which is a positive indicator for the company's performance.
