A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips could have a negative impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it indicates potential supply chain issues and reduced availability of components that Apple relies on for its products. This could lead to concerns about production delays or increased costs, which may negatively affect investor sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Apple, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. While Apple is mentioned as a customer, the news focuses on 'legacy semiconductors,' suggesting this might not directly impact Apple's core, high-margin products like iPhones, which use more advanced chips. However, the mention of Apple as a customer and the general negative sentiment surrounding chip demand could create some investor uncertainty. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's product portfolio is diverse, and it's not solely reliant on legacy chips. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Wall Street analysts predict only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales, a key driver of Apple's revenue (representing half of total revenue in fiscal 2024). This low growth projection, following similar low growth in the past two fiscal years, suggests that Apple's overall financial performance might not significantly exceed expectations.  While Apple is a large and diversified company, the iPhone's importance makes this a significant factor.  A lower-than-expected iPhone sales increase could lead to a negative market reaction, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, Apple consistently manages to surprise the market, and other product segments might perform better than anticipated, offsetting the impact of slower iPhone sales. Therefore, while the probability of a price fall is higher due to the projected low iPhone sales growth, a price rise is still possible if other factors positively influence the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's iPhone sales growth, which accounts for half of its total revenue. Analysts expect only a 1.4% annual increase, suggesting stagnation similar to previous years. This lack of significant growth could disappoint investors, leading to a negative market reaction. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple Inc. is experiencing stronger iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. This indicates a positive impact on iPhone sales, specifically with the iPhone 16 family outperforming the iPhone 15 in regions with Apple Intelligence. Given this positive sales performance, it is likely that the stock price will rise as investors perceive the company's prospects as improving. The CEO's statement on the conference call reinforces the potential for increased revenue and market share, contributing to a favorable outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports Apple's Q1 earnings, with revenue and EPS beating consensus estimates. However, the overall revenue growth was only 4% year-over-year, and some key segments like Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories showed declines. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance in the near term. Considering these mixed results, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips raises concerns about potential supply chain issues for Apple, which relies on various semiconductor components. While Apple's product portfolio is diverse and not solely dependent on legacy chips, the negative sentiment surrounding chip demand could lead to investor uncertainty. Additionally, analysts have projected low growth in iPhone sales, which is a significant revenue driver for Apple. This combination of factors suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. However, there is still a possibility of a price rise if other product segments perform better than expected or if there are positive developments in Apple's business. Overall, the probabilities lean towards a fall in stock price due to the prevailing negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that a supplier to Apple, STMicroelectronics, is forecasting a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. While Apple is a customer, the focus on 'legacy semiconductors' suggests the impact on Apple's core products (like iPhones) might be limited. However, the mention of Apple as a customer and the general negative sentiment surrounding chip demand could create some investor uncertainty. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight leaning towards a negative impact, but not overwhelmingly so. I will adjust my prediction based on the previous rounds, slightly increasing the probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on the upcoming Apple earnings report and highlights the crucial role of iPhone sales, which constitute half of Apple's total revenue.  Analysts predict only a 1.4% increase in iPhone sales, a figure that follows several years of low growth. This slow growth is a significant concern, as it suggests that Apple's overall financial performance might not significantly exceed expectations.  However, Apple is a diversified company, and other product segments could perform better than anticipated, potentially offsetting the impact of slower iPhone sales.  The previous predictions are mixed, with a slight leaning towards a price fall.  Some models highlight the potential negative impact of weak demand for legacy chips from a supplier, while others emphasize Apple's ability to surprise the market and the potential for strong performance in other product lines. Considering the low projected iPhone sales growth and the overall cautious sentiment from previous predictions, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the possibility of a price rise if other factors positively influence the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights that iPhone sales, which account for half of Apple's revenue, are expected to grow only 1.4% annually, indicating stagnation similar to previous years. This low growth projection could disappoint investors, leading to a negative market reaction. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some downside risk. Previous predictions from other models mostly lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, while a few models suggest a more balanced or slightly positive outlook. Considering the mixed signals but with a stronger emphasis on the negative impact of low iPhone sales growth, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. is experiencing stronger iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. Specifically, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that the iPhone 16 family outperformed the iPhone 15 in regions with Apple Intelligence. This positive sales performance suggests that the company's prospects are improving, which is likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price. Considering the direct correlation between the availability of Apple Intelligence and increased iPhone demand, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news reports Apple's Q1 earnings, with revenue and EPS beating consensus estimates. The overall revenue growth was 4% year-over-year, and some key segments like Europe, Japan, and Americas showed increases, while Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories showed declines. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance in the near term. Considering these mixed results and the previous predictions from other models, which showed a trend of decreasing probability of stock price rise and increasing probability of stock price fall, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news doesn't provide specific details about Apple's quarterly report, but mentions that it's scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday. Previous predictions vary, with some noting concerns about iPhone sales growth and others highlighting potential positive impacts from iPhone demand in regions with Apple Intelligence. Given the mixed signals and the upcoming quarterly report, there's uncertainty in the market. The previous predictions suggest that concerns about iPhone sales growth and mixed segment performance could outweigh positive signals, leading to a generally cautious outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
