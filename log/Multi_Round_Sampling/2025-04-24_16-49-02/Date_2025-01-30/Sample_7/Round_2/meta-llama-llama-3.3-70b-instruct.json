(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which suggests potential for future revenue growth. This positive outlook on customer acquisition and device sales is likely to boost investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, as Apple is a mature company, there may be some investors who are cautious about its growth potential, which could lead to a lower probability of a stock price fall. Overall, the positive news outweighs the negatives.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported a solid 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, specifically Apple Intelligence. This is a positive indicator. However, the article also highlights concerns about hedge funds reducing their positions in tech stocks, including those benefiting from AI, due to regulatory uncertainties and competition from companies like DeepSeek. Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, but acknowledges the potential for new players to emerge and challenge existing leaders. The article also mentions that some hedge funds are maintaining long positions, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth. Overall, the positive revenue growth and AI integration are counterbalanced by market uncertainty and hedge fund behavior. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings slightly beat expectations, with both revenue and EPS exceeding consensus estimates. However, a closer look at the key metrics reveals a mixed bag. While Services revenue showed strong growth (+13.9% YoY), and some product lines like Mac and iPad performed well, iPhone sales were slightly below expectations and other segments like Wearables underperformed.  Geographic revenue showed varied performance across regions, with some exceeding expectations (Europe, Japan) and others falling short (Greater China). The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests a negative outlook.  Considering the mixed performance and the negative Zacks rating, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall beat on earnings and revenue is slightly positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several concerns about Apple's near-term prospects, including weak feedback on AI integration, elongating device replacement cycles, and stalled market share gains in China. Despite beating earnings expectations, these factors may negatively impact investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. Despite the tech sector selloff and concerns about AI competition, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, citing strong financials and growth potential. However, some hedge funds have reduced their positions in tech stocks, including AAPL, due to regulatory uncertainties and growing international competition. The company's successful integration of AI across its product ecosystem and the recent launch of Apple Intelligence have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction. Given the mixed signals of growth and competition, we estimate the probabilities based on the cautious stance of hedge funds and the overall positive performance of AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the company's total revenue still saw a nearly 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This mixed performance suggests that while the decline in iPhone sales might negatively impact investor sentiment, the overall revenue growth could mitigate some of the negative effects. Given this, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the disappointment in iPhone sales, but the overall revenue growth might limit the extent of the decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple met Wall Street's expectations in terms of overall quarterly earnings and revenue. However, the company missed the iPhone revenue estimates, which may have a negative impact on investor sentiment. Despite the miss, Apple's CEO expressed optimism regarding future product rollouts and the potential for growth. Moreover, the company's guidance for 'low to mid single digits' growth in the March quarter was relatively positive. Analysts' concerns, particularly around the iPhone 17 and 18 sales and the traction of Apple Intelligence features, might weigh on the stock's performance. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a balanced outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which suggests potential for future revenue growth. This positive outlook on customer acquisition and device sales is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the mixed signals from previous predictions, particularly concerns about iPhone sales and market uncertainties, suggest that while there is optimism, caution remains. Given the overall positive news about customer growth and the installed base, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but I also acknowledge the potential for a fall due to existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration (Apple Intelligence), is a positive sign. Goldman Sachs' bullish stance on AI and Apple's position as an AI superstar further support a potential price increase. However, concerns about hedge funds reducing their tech positions due to regulatory uncertainties and competition from companies like DeepSeek introduce uncertainty. The previous round of predictions shows a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to concerns about iPhone sales and market share in China. Considering these factors, I believe the positive aspects slightly outweigh the negatives, but the uncertainty warrants a more cautious estimate than some of the earlier predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings beat expectations slightly, but a mixed bag of key metrics creates uncertainty. While overall revenue and EPS exceeded estimates, iPhone sales were slightly below projections, a key concern given its significance to Apple's revenue.  Other segments showed varied performance; some exceeded expectations (Mac, iPad, Services, Europe, Japan), while others fell short (Wearables, Greater China). The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further adds to the negative sentiment.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the stock's near-term movement. While the slight beat on earnings is positive, the underperformance in key areas like iPhone sales and the negative Zacks rating outweigh the positives. The overall market sentiment towards tech stocks, particularly concerning AI and regulatory uncertainty, also contributes to the uncertainty. Considering the mixed performance and the prevailing negative sentiment, the probability of a price fall is deemed higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company beat Wall Street's expectations on top and bottom lines, there are significant concerns highlighted by the analyst. These include doubts about the impact of on-device AI due to unimpressive hardware, elongating device replacement cycles, and stalled market share gains in China. These factors could negatively impact investor sentiment despite the earnings beat. Previous predictions also reflect a cautious stance, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the analyst's concerns and the mixed performance in key areas like iPhone sales and China revenue, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple reported a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. This growth, along with the successful launch of Apple Intelligence, has been well-received and is contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction. However, concerns about regulatory uncertainties, growing international competition, and hedge funds reducing their positions in tech stocks are also present. Despite these mixed signals, the overall positive performance and growth potential of Apple suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the company's total revenue still saw a nearly 4% increase from the same quarter last year. Considering the mixed performance and the trend of others' predictions, which show a range of opinions from a high probability of a stock price rise to a high probability of a stock price fall, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher due to the disappointment in iPhone sales, but the overall revenue growth might limit the extent of the decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple met Wall Street's expectations in terms of overall quarterly earnings and revenue.
