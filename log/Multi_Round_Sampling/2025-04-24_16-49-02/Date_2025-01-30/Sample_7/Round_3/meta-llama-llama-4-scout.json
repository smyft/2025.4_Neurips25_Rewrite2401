(AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which suggests potential for future revenue growth. This positive outlook on customer acquisition and device sales is likely to boost investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, as Apple is a mature company, there may be some investors who are cautious about its growth potential, which could lead to a lower probability of a stock price fall. Overall, the positive news outweighs the negatives.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported a solid 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, specifically Apple Intelligence. This is a positive indicator. However, the article also highlights concerns about hedge funds reducing their positions in tech stocks, including those benefiting from AI, due to regulatory uncertainties and competition from companies like DeepSeek. Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, but acknowledges the potential for new players to emerge and challenge existing leaders. The article also mentions that some hedge funds are maintaining long positions, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth. Overall, the positive revenue growth and AI integration are counterbalanced by market uncertainty and hedge fund behavior. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings slightly beat expectations, with both revenue and EPS exceeding consensus estimates. However, a closer look at the key metrics reveals a mixed bag. While Services revenue showed strong growth (+13.9% YoY), and some product lines like Mac and iPad performed well, iPhone sales were slightly below expectations and other segments like Wearables underperformed.  Geographic revenue showed varied performance across regions, with some exceeding expectations (Europe, Japan) and others falling short (Greater China). The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests a negative outlook.  Considering the mixed performance and the negative Zacks rating, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall beat on earnings and revenue is slightly positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several concerns about Apple's near-term prospects, including weak feedback on AI integration, elongating device replacement cycles, and stalled market share gains in China. Despite beating earnings expectations, these factors may negatively impact investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. Despite the tech sector selloff and concerns about AI competition, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, citing strong financials and growth potential. However, some hedge funds have reduced their positions in tech stocks, including AAPL, due to regulatory uncertainties and growing international competition. The company's successful integration of AI across its product ecosystem and the recent launch of Apple Intelligence have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction. Given the mixed signals of growth and competition, we estimate the probabilities based on the cautious stance of hedge funds and the overall positive performance of AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the company's total revenue still saw a nearly 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This mixed performance suggests that while the decline in iPhone sales might negatively impact investor sentiment, the overall revenue growth could mitigate some of the negative effects. Given this, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the disappointment in iPhone sales, but the overall revenue growth might limit the extent of the decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple met Wall Street's expectations in terms of overall quarterly earnings and revenue. However, the company missed the iPhone revenue estimates, which may have a negative impact on investor sentiment. Despite the miss, Apple's CEO expressed optimism regarding future product rollouts and the potential for growth. Moreover, the company's guidance for 'low to mid single digits' growth in the March quarter was relatively positive. Analysts' concerns, particularly around the iPhone 17 and 18 sales and the traction of Apple Intelligence features, might weigh on the stock's performance. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a balanced outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which suggests potential for future revenue growth. This positive outlook on customer acquisition and device sales is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the mixed signals from previous predictions, particularly concerns about iPhone sales and market uncertainties, suggest that while there is optimism, caution remains. Given the overall positive news about customer growth and the installed base, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but I also acknowledge the potential for a fall due to existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration (Apple Intelligence), is a positive sign. Goldman Sachs' bullish stance on AI and Apple's position as an AI superstar further support a potential price increase. However, concerns about hedge funds reducing their tech positions due to regulatory uncertainties and competition from companies like DeepSeek introduce uncertainty. The previous round of predictions shows a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to concerns about iPhone sales and market share in China. Considering these factors, I believe the positive aspects slightly outweigh the negatives, but the uncertainty warrants a more cautious estimate than some of the earlier predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings beat expectations slightly, but a mixed bag of key metrics creates uncertainty. While overall revenue and EPS exceeded estimates, iPhone sales were slightly below projections, a key concern given its significance to Apple's revenue.  Other segments showed varied performance; some exceeded expectations (Mac, iPad, Services, Europe, Japan), while others fell short (Wearables, Greater China). The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further adds to the negative sentiment.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the stock's near-term movement. While the slight beat on earnings is positive, the underperformance in key areas like iPhone sales and the negative Zacks rating outweigh the positives. The overall market sentiment towards tech stocks, particularly concerning AI and regulatory uncertainty, also contributes to the uncertainty. Considering the mixed performance and the prevailing negative sentiment, the probability of a price fall is deemed higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company beat Wall Street's expectations on top and bottom lines, there are significant concerns highlighted by the analyst. These include doubts about the impact of on-device AI due to unimpressive hardware, elongating device replacement cycles, and stalled market share gains in China. These factors could negatively impact investor sentiment despite the earnings beat. Previous predictions also reflect a cautious stance, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the analyst's concerns and the mixed performance in key areas like iPhone sales and China revenue, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple reported a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration.

However, concerns about regulatory uncertainties, growing international competition, and hedge funds reducing their positions in tech stocks are also present. Despite these mixed signals, the overall positive performance and growth potential of Apple suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the company's total revenue still saw a nearly 4% increase from the same quarter last year. Considering the mixed performance and the trend of others' predictions, which show a range of opinions from a high probability of a stock price rise to a high probability of a stock price fall, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher due to the disappointment in iPhone sales, but the overall revenue growth might limit the extent of the decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple met Wall Street's expectations in terms of overall quarterly earnings and revenue.

This positive outlook on customer acquisition and device sales is likely to boost investor confidence. However, there are mixed signals from previous predictions, particularly concerns about iPhone sales and market uncertainties, which suggest caution. Overall, the positive news about customer growth and the installed base leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising, but existing concerns about performance in key areas temper this optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a 6% revenue growth for Apple in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, specifically Apple Intelligence.

The trend in previous predictions is also slightly downward, indicating increasing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings report presents a mixed picture. While overall revenue and EPS slightly exceeded expectations, key metrics reveal inconsistencies.  iPhone sales, a crucial revenue driver, fell short of estimates, a significant negative.  Other segments showed varied performance, with some exceeding expectations (Mac, iPad, Services, Europe, Japan) and others underperforming (Wearables, Greater China). The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further dampens the outlook.  The previous predictions from various models highlight the uncertainty, with probabilities ranging widely.  Considering the underperformance in iPhone sales, the mixed geographic revenue performance, and the negative Zacks rating, the probability of a price fall is higher. However, the overall revenue beat and positive growth in some segments mitigate the negative impact to some extent. The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, which I also find to be the more likely outcome given the available information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
