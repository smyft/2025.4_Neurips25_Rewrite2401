Although the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. as one of the companies, Apple is a well-known player in the AI space, incorporating AI technologies into its products and services. This indirect association with AI and the endorsement of AI-related investments by a prominent investor like Warren Buffett could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple Inc., potentially leading to a rise in its stock price. However, the news does not provide a direct link between Berkshire's investments and Apple, which might limit the impact on Apple's stock price.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett Has $74 Billion of Berkshire Hathaway's $301 Billion Portfolio Tied Up in 2 Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.20\n}"
