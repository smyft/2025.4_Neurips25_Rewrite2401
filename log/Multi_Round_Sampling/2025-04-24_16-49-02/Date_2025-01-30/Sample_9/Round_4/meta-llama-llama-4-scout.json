(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Compared to Estimates, Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: A Look at Key Metrics\nNews Content: For the quarter ended December 2024, Apple (AAPL) reported revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% over the same period last year. EPS came in at $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.24% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to the previous year, which is generally positive for stock price movement. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the expected growth in earnings and revenue, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the concern over iPhone demand introduces some risk, leading to a lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline \"Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle\" suggests a potential slowdown in iPhone sales growth. The article highlights a historical three-year cycle of high sales, with recent years deviating from this pattern. Cook's response during the earnings call, while optimistic, doesn't directly address the missing cycle, instead focusing on future opportunities related to COVID-era purchases. This ambiguity could be interpreted negatively by investors who rely on predictable upgrade cycles. While Cook's optimism provides some counterweight, the lack of a clear explanation for the deviation from the historical cycle introduces uncertainty. Therefore, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple reported slightly lower than expected iPhone sales for the December quarter, missing analyst projections. While overall revenue was up, the iPhone shortfall is significant because it's Apple's most valuable product.  The news highlights the market's anticipation of AI-driven growth, which hasn't yet materialized. This is a mixed signal.  The slight revenue increase and the overall positive outlook for AI integration in the future could mitigate the negative impact of the missed iPhone sales target. However, the market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh the short-term miss against the long-term AI potential.  A slight negative reaction is more likely in the short term due to the missed expectations, but the overall positive revenue growth and future AI prospects suggest the fall won't be drastic.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise in the immediate aftermath of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings release alongside other major companies and key economic data. Apple's stock price movement will likely be influenced by its earnings performance relative to market expectations. Given the broader context of slowing GDP growth and mixed economic signals, investor sentiment could be cautious. However, Apple's strong historical performance and market position may provide some resilience. The probability of a rise or fall depends heavily on whether earnings exceed or miss expectations, but without specific earnings data, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge to positive sentiment due to Apple's track record.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. However, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month, underperforming the broader market. Key metrics show mixed results, with significant growth in Europe, Japan, and certain product categories like Mac and iPad, but declines in Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Given the mixed performance and the current sell rating, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has achieved 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. This growth is a positive indicator for the company's performance. However, the article also mentions that hedge funds have been reducing their positions in technology stocks, including AAPL, due to concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector and regulatory uncertainties. Despite this, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, and some hedge funds are maintaining long positions in AAPL. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that iPhone sales, which account for half of Apple's total revenue, are expected to have only a minor increase of 1.4% compared to the previous year. This suggests a continuation of low iPhone growth similar to recent years. Given the significant role of iPhone sales in Apple's financial performance, such modest growth could disappoint investors and potentially lead to a negative market reaction.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to the previous year, which is generally positive for stock price movement. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the expected growth in earnings and revenue, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the concern over iPhone demand introduces some risk, leading to a lower probability of a price fall. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions, I estimate a balanced outlook with a slight edge towards a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on a potential slowdown in Apple's iPhone sales cycle, highlighting a deviation from the historical three-year pattern. Cook's response, while optimistic, doesn't directly address the missing cycle, which could create uncertainty among investors. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a rise based on overall revenue growth and AI potential, while others predicted a fall due to missed iPhone sales targets and concerns about the missing refresh cycle. The most recent prediction leans towards a fall due to the expected minor increase in iPhone sales. Given the continued focus on the iPhone cycle and the potential for investor disappointment, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall, but not drastically so, as Apple has other product categories and future opportunities. I will adjust my prediction based on the trend of previous predictions, which seems to be leaning towards a negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While overall revenue increased slightly, the crucial iPhone sales fell short of analyst expectations. This miss, coupled with the anticipation of AI-driven growth that hasn't yet materialized, creates uncertainty.  The previous predictions are quite varied, ranging from a 30% to 65% probability of a price rise.  The consensus seems to lean slightly towards a price fall, but not drastically.  Considering the slight revenue increase, the importance of the iPhone segment, and the lack of immediate AI payoff, a moderate negative reaction is more likely than a significant positive one.  The previous models' varied predictions highlight the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based solely on this news. I'm weighting the negative aspects slightly more heavily due to the missed iPhone sales target, which is a key performance indicator for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline and content provide a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is set to release its quarterly earnings alongside other major companies, which could generate investor interest. However, the broader economic context includes slowing GDP growth (expected at 2.7%) and pending home sales data, which may introduce market volatility. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a slight rise due to Apple's strong historical performance and others predicting a fall due to concerns over iPhone demand and mixed earnings signals. Given the uncertainty around earnings performance relative to expectations and the broader economic data, the probabilities are balanced but with a slight edge towards a rise due to Apple's resilience and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings report showed a revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% over the same period last year, and an EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. Apple's stock has underperformed in the past month with a return of -4.4%. The mixed performance across different regions and product categories, along with modest growth in some areas and declines in others, introduces uncertainty. However, given the overall positive revenue growth and EPS beat, there's a cautious optimism that could lead to a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The concern over iPhone demand and the mixed performance across different geographies and product lines suggest that while there's potential for growth, there are also significant challenges that could impact investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news reports a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 for Apple Inc., driven by new product launches and AI integration. Despite concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector and regulatory uncertainties, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures. Some hedge funds are maintaining long positions in AAPL, indicating confidence in future AI-driven growth. However, the overall trend in the tech sector, with hedge funds reducing their positions, introduces some uncertainty. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling, reflecting the positive growth and the potential for future AI-driven advancements.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued low growth expectation for iPhone sales, which are crucial for Apple's financial performance. Multiple previous predictions indicate a general pessimism due to the low expectations for iPhone sales growth. However, there are some positives such as revenue growth and potential AI-driven opportunities. Overall, the weight of the previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to the previous year, which is generally positive for stock price movement.

Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to overall revenue growth and others predicting a fall due to missed iPhone sales targets.

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, but the trend is leaning towards a negative outlook due to the expected minor increase in iPhone sales. The iPhone is a major revenue driver for Apple, so a slowdown in its sales cycle is a significant concern. While Apple has other product categories and future opportunities, the uncertainty surrounding the iPhone cycle is likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While overall revenue increased slightly, the crucial iPhone sales, representing a significant portion of Apple's revenue, fell short of analyst expectations. This miss, coupled with the anticipation of AI-driven growth that hasn't yet materialized, creates uncertainty.  The previous predictions are varied, highlighting the inherent difficulty in predicting short-term stock movements based solely on this news.  However, a trend towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall is evident in the later rounds of predictions.  The consensus leans towards a negative reaction due to the missed iPhone sales target, a key performance indicator for Apple.  While the slight revenue increase and potential future AI growth offer some counterbalance, the immediate impact of the missed iPhone sales target is likely to outweigh these positives in the short term.  Therefore, I'm weighting the negative aspects more heavily.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline and content provide a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Previous predictions have shown a range of sentiments, with some indicating a slight rise due to overall revenue growth and AI potential, while others predict a fall due to missed iPhone sales targets and concerns about the missing refresh cycle. The most recent round of predictions leans more towards a fall, with several models indicating higher probabilities of a stock price decline. The mixed signals and the importance of iPhone sales in Apple's financials suggest caution, leading to a slightly higher probability of a price fall.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to the previous year, which is generally positive for stock price movement. However, there is significant concern regarding iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to overall revenue growth and others predicting a fall due to missed iPhone sales targets. Given the mixed signals and the importance of iPhone sales to Apple's overall performance, I estimate a balanced outlook with a slight edge towards a price rise, but the risk of a price fall remains significant due to the concerns over iPhone demand.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news focuses on a potential slowdown in Apple's iPhone sales cycle, highlighting a deviation from the historical three-year pattern.

While overall revenue increased slightly, the crucial iPhone sales, a major revenue driver for Apple, missed analyst expectations. This is a significant negative, especially given the market's anticipation of AI-driven growth, which hasn't yet materialized.  The previous predictions show a trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, although there's considerable variation.  The consensus seems to be that the negative impact of the missed iPhone sales target outweighs the positive impact of the slight overall revenue increase and the potential for future AI growth in the short term.  However, Apple's strong historical performance and market position provide some resilience. Considering the mixed signals and the trend in previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but not a drastic one.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline and content provide a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
