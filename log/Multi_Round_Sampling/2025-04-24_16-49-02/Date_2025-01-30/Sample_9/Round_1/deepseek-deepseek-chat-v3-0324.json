A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to the previous year, which is generally positive for stock price movement. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the expected growth in earnings and revenue, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the concern over iPhone demand introduces some risk, leading to a lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline \"Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle\" suggests a potential slowdown in iPhone sales growth. The article highlights a historical three-year cycle of high sales, with recent years deviating from this pattern. Cook's response during the earnings call, while optimistic, doesn't directly address the missing cycle, instead focusing on future opportunities related to COVID-era purchases. This ambiguity could be interpreted negatively by investors who rely on predictable upgrade cycles. While Cook's optimism provides some counterweight, the lack of a clear explanation for the deviation from the historical cycle introduces uncertainty. Therefore, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple reported slightly lower than expected iPhone sales for the December quarter, missing analyst projections. While overall revenue was up, the iPhone shortfall is significant because it's Apple's most valuable product.  The news highlights the market's anticipation of AI-driven growth, which hasn't yet materialized. This is a mixed signal.  The slight revenue increase and the overall positive outlook for AI integration in the future could mitigate the negative impact of the missed iPhone sales target. However, the market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh the short-term miss against the long-term AI potential.  A slight negative reaction is more likely in the short term due to the missed expectations, but the overall positive revenue growth and future AI prospects suggest the fall won't be drastic.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise in the immediate aftermath of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings release alongside other major companies and key economic data. Apple's stock price movement will likely be influenced by its earnings performance relative to market expectations. Given the broader context of slowing GDP growth and mixed economic signals, investor sentiment could be cautious. However, Apple's strong historical performance and market position may provide some resilience. The probability of a rise or fall depends heavily on whether earnings exceed or miss expectations, but without specific earnings data, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge to positive sentiment due to Apple's track record.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. However, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month, underperforming the broader market. Key metrics show mixed results, with significant growth in Europe, Japan, and certain product categories like Mac and iPad, but declines in Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Given the mixed performance and the current sell rating, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has achieved 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. This growth is a positive indicator for the company's performance. However, the article also mentions that hedge funds have been reducing their positions in technology stocks, including AAPL, due to concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector and regulatory uncertainties. Despite this, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, and some hedge funds are maintaining long positions in AAPL. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that iPhone sales, which account for half of Apple's total revenue, are expected to have only a minor increase of 1.4% compared to the previous year. This suggests a continuation of low iPhone growth similar to recent years. Given the significant role of iPhone sales in Apple's financial performance, such modest growth could disappoint investors and potentially lead to a negative market reaction.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
