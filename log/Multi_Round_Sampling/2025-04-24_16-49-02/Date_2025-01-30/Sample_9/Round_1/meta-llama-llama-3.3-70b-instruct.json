(AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to the previous year, which is generally positive for stock price movement. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the expected growth in earnings and revenue, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the concern over iPhone demand introduces some risk, leading to a lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline \"Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle\" suggests a potential slowdown in iPhone sales growth. The article highlights a historical three-year cycle of high sales, with recent years deviating from this pattern. Cook's response during the earnings call, while optimistic, doesn't directly address the missing cycle, instead focusing on future opportunities related to COVID-era purchases. This ambiguity could be interpreted negatively by investors who rely on predictable upgrade cycles. While Cook's optimism provides some counterweight, the lack of a clear explanation for the deviation from the historical cycle introduces uncertainty. Therefore, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple reported slightly lower than expected iPhone sales for the December quarter, missing analyst projections. While overall revenue was up, the iPhone shortfall is significant because it's Apple's most valuable product.  The news highlights the market's anticipation of AI-driven growth, which hasn't yet materialized. This is a mixed signal.  The slight revenue increase and the overall positive outlook for AI integration in the future could mitigate the negative impact of the missed iPhone sales target. However, the market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh the short-term miss against the long-term AI potential.  A slight negative reaction is more likely in the short term due to the missed expectations, but the overall positive revenue growth and future AI prospects suggest the fall won't be drastic.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise in the immediate aftermath of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings release alongside other major companies and key economic data. Apple's stock price movement will likely be influenced by its earnings performance relative to market expectations. Given the broader context of slowing GDP growth and mixed economic signals, investor sentiment could be cautious. However, Apple's strong historical performance and market position may provide some resilience. The probability of a rise or fall depends heavily on whether earnings exceed or miss expectations, but without specific earnings data, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge to positive sentiment due to Apple's track record.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. However, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month, underperforming the broader market. Key metrics show mixed results, with significant growth in Europe, Japan, and certain product categories like Mac and iPad, but declines in Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Given the mixed performance and the current sell rating, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has achieved 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. This growth is a positive indicator for the company's performance. However, the article also mentions that hedge funds have been reducing their positions in technology stocks, including AAPL, due to concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector and regulatory uncertainties. Despite this, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, and some hedge funds are maintaining long positions in AAPL. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that iPhone sales, which account for half of Apple's total revenue, are expected to have only a minor increase of 1.4% compared to the previous year. This suggests a continuation of low iPhone growth similar to recent years. Given the significant role of iPhone sales in Apple's financial performance, such modest growth could disappoint investors and potentially lead to a negative market reaction.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
