      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue. DeepSeek Validates the Approach.\nNews Content: Apple continues to spend less than its Magnificent 7 peers on artificial intelligence. American tech companies have spent billions of dollars on developing generative artificial intelligence projects, with plans to spend much more. Facebook parent Meta Platforms said last week that Meta is planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year while significantly increasing the size of the company\u2019s AI teams.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report shows a mixed performance. While the company exceeded revenue and EPS estimates, there were significant declines in revenue from Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The overall revenue growth of 4% year-over-year is positive, but the underperformance in key regions and product categories may raise concerns among investors. Additionally, the stock has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance in the near term. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing ad spending on X, and Apple is considering testing ads on the platform. This suggests a potential increase in revenue for X, which could indirectly benefit companies associated with X through positive sentiment or broader market trends. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more significant for X and potentially Amazon. The fact that Amazon was down 1% in recent trading suggests the market isn't reacting strongly to this news. Therefore, the impact on Apple is likely neutral to slightly positive. Given the limited direct impact and the overall market context, a slight rise is more probable than a fall, but the effect is expected to be small.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race,  it could also be interpreted as a sign of Apple's disciplined approach to spending and a focus on profitability.  The article mentions DeepSeek validating this approach, implying that Apple's strategy might be sound.  The massive AI investments by competitors like Meta are not necessarily a benchmark for success; they could represent overspending or a less efficient allocation of resources.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  A slight negative reaction is possible due to the prevailing narrative around the importance of AI investment, but the validation by DeepSeek and Apple's history of strong financial performance mitigate this risk.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, reflecting the potential for investors to see Apple's approach as prudent.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone 16 family is performing better year-over-year in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, suggesting strong demand linked to the AI features. This positive performance and CEO Tim Cook's comments could boost investor confidence in Apple's product strategy and future revenue potential. Given the positive sentiment and the potential for increased sales, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that STMicroelectronics, a supplier to Apple, Tesla, and Samsung, forecasts a sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips. This news may negatively impact Apple's stock price as it suggests potential supply chain or production issues, or at least a challenging environment for one of its key suppliers. However, the direct impact on Apple might be limited as the news is more about the supplier's general performance and less about Apple's specific business with STMicroelectronics. Given this, the probability of a stock price rise is lower, and the probability of a fall is higher, but not extremely high as the direct connection to Apple's core business is not clear.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the company's total revenue still saw a nearly 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This mixed performance suggests that while the decline in iPhone sales might negatively impact investor sentiment, the overall revenue growth could mitigate some of the negative effects. Given this, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the disappointment in iPhone sales, but the overall revenue growth might limit the extent of the decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that iPhone sales, which account for half of Apple's total revenue, are expected to have only a minor increase of 1.4% compared to the previous year. This suggests a continuation of low iPhone growth similar to recent years. Given the significant role of iPhone sales in Apple's financial performance, such modest growth could disappoint investors and potentially lead to a negative market reaction.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While this could be viewed negatively, suggesting a lack of commitment to a crucial emerging technology, the article also presents a counter-argument: DeepSeek validates Apple's approach. This suggests that Apple's strategy, prioritizing profitability and disciplined spending over aggressive AI investment, might be sound.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some highlighting concerns about iPhone sales and overall market performance, while others point to potential positives like strong iPhone 16 performance in certain markets.  The overall sentiment from previous models leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall. However, the DeepSeek validation adds a layer of nuance.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the potential for negative market reaction to the lower-than-expected AI spending, but acknowledging the mitigating factor of DeepSeek's validation. The previous predictions' range and lack of strong consensus further support a neutral-to-slightly negative outlook.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue.
