This suggests a potential increase in revenue for X, which could indirectly benefit companies associated with X through positive sentiment or broader market trends. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more significant for X and potentially Amazon. The fact that Amazon was down 1% in recent trading suggests the market isn't reacting strongly to this news. Therefore, the impact on Apple is likely neutral to slightly positive. Given the limited direct impact and the overall market context, a slight rise is more probable than a fall, but the effect is expected to be small.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
