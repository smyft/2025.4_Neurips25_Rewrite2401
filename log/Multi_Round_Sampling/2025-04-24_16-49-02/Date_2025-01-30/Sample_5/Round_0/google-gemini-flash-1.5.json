While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race,  it could also be interpreted as a sign of Apple's disciplined approach to spending and a focus on profitability.  The article mentions DeepSeek validating this approach, implying that Apple's strategy might be sound.  The massive AI investments by competitors like Meta are not necessarily a benchmark for success; they could represent overspending or a less efficient allocation of resources.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  A slight negative reaction is possible due to the prevailing narrative around the importance of AI investment, but the validation by DeepSeek and Apple's history of strong financial performance mitigate this risk.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, reflecting the potential for investors to see Apple's approach as prudent.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue.
