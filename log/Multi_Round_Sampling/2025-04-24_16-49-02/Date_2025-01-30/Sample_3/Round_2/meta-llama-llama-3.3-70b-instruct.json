(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which suggests a strong belief in the future potential of AI technologies. Given Apple's involvement in AI through its products and services, this news could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the news does not directly mention Apple, which may limit the immediate impact on its stock price. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI investments could lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. The initial positive reaction might be tempered by the unfavorable estimate revisions trend leading up to the earnings release, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This indicates analysts were already anticipating potential underperformance. Furthermore, Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The industry rank (bottom 28%) also presents a headwind. Management's commentary on the earnings call will be crucial, but the pre-existing negative sentiment and industry challenges suggest a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, even with the earnings beat. The earnings beat was also relatively small (1.69% surprise).\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X (formerly Twitter), and mentions that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform.  While this is positive for X, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news is indirect and doesn't provide any substantial information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  The probability of a price change is therefore low in either direction, with the market likely already pricing in the potential for Apple to advertise on X. Any movement would likely be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending significantly less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is planning a massive $60-$65 billion investment in AI. This could be interpreted in two ways: (1) Apple is being prudent and focusing on efficient AI development, which DeepSeek validates, potentially leading to long-term benefits. (2) Investors might perceive Apple as falling behind in the AI arms race, which could negatively impact sentiment. Given Apple\u2019s history of strategic investments and strong market position, the news is likely neutral to slightly positive, but some investors may react negatively due to the perception of underinvestment in AI.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle' suggests concerns about Apple's product refresh cycle and its potential impact on iPhone sales. However, during the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook focused on the opportunities ahead, mentioning that the COVID period saw a surge in unit sales, which presents a chance for growth across multiple product categories. The tone of the news is somewhat negative due to the missing refresh cycle, but Cook's statements aim to highlight future opportunities rather than dwell on past performance. Given this, the market might react moderately, with a slight bias towards negativity due to the missing refresh cycle but also considering Cook's optimistic outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be around 0.55, and the probability of it falling is around 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall positive trend in the tech industry, with many big tech companies reporting their quarterly earnings. Despite some concerns over AI spending, executives from Microsoft and Meta Platforms defended their investments, citing the need to maintain competitiveness. Apple, which is due to report its earnings, is expected to show tepid quarterly revenue growth due to intensifying competition in its major Chinese market. However, Apple is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model compared to its peers, and its relatively modest capital expenditures on AI could be seen as a positive. The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady and the European Central Bank's expected rate cut could also have a positive impact on the stock market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to release its quarterly earnings report, which is expected to provide detailed insights into the company's financial performance for the recent quarter. The market will closely analyze these earnings for any positive or negative indicators about the company's future prospects. Additionally, the release of fourth-quarter GDP data and home sales data could indirectly impact investor sentiment regarding the broader economy and specific sectors like housing. These factors could either positively or negatively influence AAPL's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which reflects a strong belief in the potential of AI technologies. While Apple is not directly mentioned, its involvement in AI could lead to positive sentiment among investors. However, previous predictions indicate a mix of cautious outlooks due to factors like underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and concerns about Apple's AI spending compared to competitors. Given the overall positive sentiment around AI investments and the mixed signals from previous analyses, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of it falling due to existing negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings and revenue beat estimates, which is generally a positive sign. However, the earnings surprise was relatively small (1.69%). The company has consistently surpassed estimates in the past, suggesting a reliable performance. On the other hand, the Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), indicating unfavorable estimate revisions prior to the earnings release, and the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The industry rank is also unfavorable. Management's commentary will be crucial, but the pre-existing negative sentiment and industry challenges suggest a mixed outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise due to AI investments and others towards a fall due to negative sentiment and industry challenges. Given the mixed signals, I'll slightly favor a price rise due to the earnings beat, but acknowledge the significant headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news about Amazon increasing ad spending on X and Apple considering testing ads on the platform is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The impact is likely to be minimal, as this is a small, indirect piece of information with no significant bearing on Apple's core business or financial performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement in general.  Given the weak connection between the news and Apple's prospects, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability to both price increases and decreases.  The previous predictions, while varied, don't offer strong evidence to significantly sway this assessment. The news is more relevant to X and Amazon than to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which could be interpreted either as prudence or as falling behind in the AI race. DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach might provide some reassurance to investors. However, the perception of underinvestment in AI could weigh on sentiment. Given the mixed interpretations and the fact that Apple's stock often reacts to broader market trends and its own product cycles rather than just AI spending news, the probability of a rise or fall is nearly balanced. The previous round of predictions also shows a divided sentiment, with some models leaning slightly positive and others slightly negative. Therefore, the probabilities are set close to neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall trend in the tech industry, with many big tech companies reporting their quarterly earnings. Despite some concerns over AI spending, executives from Microsoft and Meta Platforms defended their investments, citing the need to maintain competitiveness. Apple, which is due to report its earnings, is expected to show tepid quarterly revenue growth due to intensifying competition in its major Chinese market. However, Apple is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model compared to its peers, and its relatively modest capital expenditures on AI could be seen as a positive. The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady and the European Central Bank's expected rate cut could also have a positive impact on the stock market. Considering the mixed sentiments and the fact that Apple's earnings report is yet to be released, the probability of the stock price rising or falling seems balanced. However, given the overall positive trend in the tech industry and the relatively modest AI spending by Apple, the probability of the stock price rising might be slightly higher.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple market events and economic data points, including Apple's quarterly earnings, Q4 GDP data, and home sales data. Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments, with varying reasons including AI investments, earnings beats, market underperformance, and product refresh cycles. The upcoming earnings report and economic data will likely have a significant impact on investor sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the comprehensive nature of the upcoming data, the probability of a stock price movement is balanced.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
