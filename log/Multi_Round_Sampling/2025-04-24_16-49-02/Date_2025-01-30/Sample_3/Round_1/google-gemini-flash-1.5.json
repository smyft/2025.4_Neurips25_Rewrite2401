      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is increasing its spending on social media platform X, marking a major U-turn from the e-commerce after scaling back on advertising on the Elon's Musk-owned platform more than a year ago amid concerns about growing hate speech on the platform, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nThe news comes as other companies have also been mulling whether to return to X at a time when Musk has President Donald Trump's ear after playing a key role on election campaign trail.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in recent weeks weeks has had discussions about testing out ads on the platform, a person familiar with the situation told the Journal.\n\nAmazon was down 1% in recent trading.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\n\nKLA Corp earnings beat by $0.45, revenue topped estimates\n\nAtlassian stock soars 18% on earnings beat, strong outlook\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which suggests a strong belief in the future potential of AI technologies. Given Apple's involvement in AI through its products and services, this news could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the news does not directly mention Apple, which may limit the immediate impact on its stock price. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI investments could lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. The initial positive reaction might be tempered by the unfavorable estimate revisions trend leading up to the earnings release, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This indicates analysts were already anticipating potential underperformance. Furthermore, Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The industry rank (bottom 28%) also presents a headwind. Management's commentary on the earnings call will be crucial, but the pre-existing negative sentiment and industry challenges suggest a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, even with the earnings beat. The earnings beat was also relatively small (1.69% surprise).\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X (formerly Twitter), and mentions that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform.  While this is positive for X, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news is indirect and doesn't provide any substantial information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  The probability of a price change is therefore low in either direction, with the market likely already pricing in the potential for Apple to advertise on X. Any movement would likely be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending significantly less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is planning a massive $60-$65 billion investment in AI. This could be interpreted in two ways: (1) Apple is being prudent and focusing on efficient AI development, which DeepSeek validates, potentially leading to long-term benefits. (2) Investors might perceive Apple as falling behind in the AI arms race, which could negatively impact sentiment. Given Apple\u2019s history of strategic investments and strong market position, the news is likely neutral to slightly positive, but some investors may react negatively due to the perception of underinvestment in AI.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle' suggests concerns about Apple's product refresh cycle and its potential impact on iPhone sales. However, during the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook focused on the opportunities ahead, mentioning that the COVID period saw a surge in unit sales, which presents a chance for growth across multiple product categories. The tone of the news is somewhat negative due to the missing refresh cycle, but Cook's statements aim to highlight future opportunities rather than dwell on past performance. Given this, the market might react moderately, with a slight bias towards negativity due to the missing refresh cycle but also considering Cook's optimistic outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be around 0.55, and the probability of it falling is around 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall positive trend in the tech industry, with many big tech companies reporting their quarterly earnings. Despite some concerns over AI spending, executives from Microsoft and Meta Platforms defended their investments, citing the need to maintain competitiveness. Apple, which is due to report its earnings, is expected to show tepid quarterly revenue growth due to intensifying competition in its major Chinese market. However, Apple is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model compared to its peers, and its relatively modest capital expenditures on AI could be seen as a positive. The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady and the European Central Bank's expected rate cut could also have a positive impact on the stock market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to release its quarterly earnings report, which is expected to provide detailed insights into the company's financial performance for the recent quarter. The market will closely analyze these earnings for any positive or negative indicators about the company's future prospects. Additionally, the release of fourth-quarter GDP data and home sales data could indirectly impact investor sentiment regarding the broader economy and specific sectors like housing. These factors could either positively or negatively influence AAPL's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
