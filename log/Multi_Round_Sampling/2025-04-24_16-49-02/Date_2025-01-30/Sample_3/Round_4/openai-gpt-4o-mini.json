      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Warren Buffett Has $74 Billion of Berkshire Hathaway's $301 Billion Portfolio Tied Up in 2 Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Roughly a quarter of Berkshire's invested assets can be traced to companies reliant on the AI revolution.\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which suggests a strong belief in the future potential of AI technologies. Given Apple's involvement in AI through its products and services, this news could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the news does not directly mention Apple, which may limit the immediate impact on its stock price. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI investments could lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. The initial positive reaction might be tempered by the unfavorable estimate revisions trend leading up to the earnings release, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This indicates analysts were already anticipating potential underperformance. Furthermore, Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The industry rank (bottom 28%) also presents a headwind. Management's commentary on the earnings call will be crucial, but the pre-existing negative sentiment and industry challenges suggest a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, even with the earnings beat. The earnings beat was also relatively small (1.69% surprise).\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X (formerly Twitter), and mentions that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform.  While this is positive for X, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news is indirect and doesn't provide any substantial information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  The probability of a price change is therefore low in either direction, with the market likely already pricing in the potential for Apple to advertise on X. Any movement would likely be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending significantly less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is planning a massive $60-$65 billion investment in AI. This could be interpreted in two ways: (1) Apple is being prudent and focusing on efficient AI development, which DeepSeek validates, potentially leading to long-term benefits. (2) Investors might perceive Apple as falling behind in the AI arms race, which could negatively impact sentiment. Given Apple\u2019s history of strategic investments and strong market position, the news is likely neutral to slightly positive, but some investors may react negatively due to the perception of underinvestment in AI.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle' suggests concerns about Apple's product refresh cycle and its potential impact on iPhone sales. However, during the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook focused on the opportunities ahead, mentioning that the COVID period saw a surge in unit sales, which presents a chance for growth across multiple product categories. The tone of the news is somewhat negative due to the missing refresh cycle, but Cook's statements aim to highlight future opportunities rather than dwell on past performance. Given this, the market might react moderately, with a slight bias towards negativity due to the missing refresh cycle but also considering Cook's optimistic outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be around 0.55, and the probability of it falling is around 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall positive trend in the tech industry, with many big tech companies reporting their quarterly earnings. Despite some concerns over AI spending, executives from Microsoft and Meta Platforms defended their investments, citing the need to maintain competitiveness. Apple, which is due to report its earnings, is expected to show tepid quarterly revenue growth due to intensifying competition in its major Chinese market. However, Apple is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model compared to its peers, and its relatively modest capital expenditures on AI could be seen as a positive. The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady and the European Central Bank's expected rate cut could also have a positive impact on the stock market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to release its quarterly earnings report, which is expected to provide detailed insights into the company's financial performance for the recent quarter. The market will closely analyze these earnings for any positive or negative indicators about the company's future prospects. Additionally, the release of fourth-quarter GDP data and home sales data could indirectly impact investor sentiment regarding the broader economy and specific sectors like housing. These factors could either positively or negatively influence AAPL's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which reflects a strong belief in the potential of AI technologies. While Apple is not directly mentioned, its involvement in AI could lead to positive sentiment among investors. However, previous predictions indicate a mix of cautious outlooks due to factors like underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and concerns about Apple's AI spending compared to competitors. Given the overall positive sentiment around AI investments and the mixed signals from previous analyses, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of it falling due to existing negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings and revenue beat estimates, which is generally a positive sign. However, the earnings surprise was relatively small (1.69%). The company has consistently surpassed estimates in the past, suggesting a reliable performance. On the other hand, the Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), indicating unfavorable estimate revisions prior to the earnings release, and the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The industry rank is also unfavorable. Management's commentary will be crucial, but the pre-existing negative sentiment and industry challenges suggest a mixed outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise due to AI investments and others towards a fall due to negative sentiment and industry challenges. Given the mixed signals, I'll slightly favor a price rise due to the earnings beat, but acknowledge the significant headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news about Amazon increasing ad spending on X and Apple considering testing ads on the platform is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The impact is likely to be minimal, as this is a small, indirect piece of information with no significant bearing on Apple's core business or financial performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement in general.  Given the weak connection between the news and Apple's prospects, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability to both price increases and decreases.  The previous predictions, while varied, don't offer strong evidence to significantly sway this assessment. The news is more relevant to X and Amazon than to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which could be interpreted either as prudence or as falling behind in the AI race. DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach might provide some reassurance to investors. However, the perception of underinvestment in AI could weigh on sentiment. Given the mixed interpretations and the fact that Apple's stock often reacts to broader market trends and its own product cycles rather than just AI spending news, the probability of a rise or fall is nearly balanced. The previous round of predictions also shows a divided sentiment, with some models leaning slightly positive and others slightly negative. Therefore, the probabilities are set close to neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall trend in the tech industry, with many big tech companies reporting their quarterly earnings. Despite some concerns over AI spending, executives from Microsoft and Meta Platforms defended their investments, citing the need to maintain competitiveness. Apple, which is due to report its earnings, is expected to show tepid quarterly revenue growth due to intensifying competition in its major Chinese market.

The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady and the European Central Bank's expected rate cut could also have a positive impact on the stock market. Considering the mixed sentiments and the fact that Apple's earnings report is yet to be released, the probability of the stock price rising or falling seems balanced. However, given the overall positive trend in the tech industry and the relatively modest AI spending by Apple, the probability of the stock price rising might be slightly higher.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple market events and economic data points, including Apple's quarterly earnings, Q4 GDP data, and home sales data. Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments, with varying reasons including AI investments, earnings beats, market underperformance, and product refresh cycles. The upcoming earnings report and economic data will likely have a significant impact on investor sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the comprehensive nature of the upcoming data, the probability of a stock price movement is balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which reflects a strong belief in the potential of AI technologies.

However, the earnings surprise was relatively small at 1.69%. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests unfavorable estimate revisions prior to the earnings release, and the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The industry rank is also unfavorable. Management's commentary on the earnings call will be crucial. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Given the mixed signals, I'll slightly favor a price rise due to the earnings beat, but acknowledge the significant headwinds. The unfavorable estimate revisions and industry rank temper the positive impact of the earnings beat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Amazon increasing its ad spending on X and Apple considering testing ads there is weakly relevant to Apple's stock price.  The impact is likely minimal, as it's indirect and doesn't significantly affect Apple's core business or financials.  Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting overall uncertainty about Apple's stock movement.  The news itself provides little reason for a significant price change in either direction.  The previous predictions, while varied, don't offer strong evidence to significantly alter this assessment.  Therefore, the probabilities are set close to neutral, slightly favoring a price rise due to the overall positive sentiment around AI (though not directly related to this news) and the potential for increased revenue from X advertising, but acknowledging the existing uncertainty and the relatively small impact of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's relatively low spending on AI compared to peers like Meta, which is investing heavily. This could be seen as either prudent cost management or a lack of competitive investment in a rapidly evolving sector. DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach might reassure some investors, but others may worry about falling behind in the AI race. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strategic history, while others are cautious due to potential underinvestment. Given this balance of factors and the mixed interpretations from previous rounds, the probabilities are nearly balanced with a slight edge towards a fall due to negative perceptions around AI spending.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle' and the content discussing Apple's product cycle and CEO Tim Cook's focus on future opportunities suggest a mixed outlook. The historical three-year cycle for iPhone sales and the COVID-19 surge in unit sales present both challenges and opportunities. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning positive due to AI investments and earnings beats, and others negative due to underperformance and AI spending concerns. Considering these factors, the probabilities are balanced but slightly favor a rise due to the company's strategic opportunities and historical performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall trend in the tech industry, with many big tech companies reporting their quarterly earnings.

The upcoming earnings report and economic data will likely have a significant impact on investor sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the comprehensive nature of the upcoming data, the probability of a stock price movement is balanced.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI stocks, which reflects a strong belief in the potential of AI technologies.

However, the earnings surprise was relatively small (1.69%). The Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), indicating unfavorable estimate revisions prior to the earnings release, and the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The industry rank is also unfavorable. Management's commentary on the earnings call will be crucial. The estimate revisions trend for Apple was unfavorable ahead of the earnings release. The company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting underperformance in the near future. The industry is in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions. Given the mixed signals, I'll slightly favor a price fall due to the unfavorable estimate revisions and industry rank, but acknowledge the earnings beat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about Amazon increasing its ad spending on X and Apple considering testing ads on the platform has a very weak, indirect relationship to Apple's stock price.  The impact is likely to be minimal, as it's a small, peripheral detail with no significant bearing on Apple's core business or financial performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the overall uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement.  These predictions are based on various factors, including AI investments, earnings reports, market performance, and product cycles, none of which are directly addressed by this news.  Therefore, the probabilities are set close to neutral.  The slight lean towards a price rise in some previous predictions is likely due to broader positive sentiment around AI and the potential for increased revenue from X advertising, but this is not directly supported by the news itself. The news is more relevant to X and Amazon than to Apple.  Given the lack of direct impact and the existing uncertainty, a neutral prediction is most appropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's relatively low spending on AI compared to its peers, which could be interpreted in two ways: (1) as a prudent and efficient approach validated by DeepSeek, or (2) as falling behind in the AI arms race.
