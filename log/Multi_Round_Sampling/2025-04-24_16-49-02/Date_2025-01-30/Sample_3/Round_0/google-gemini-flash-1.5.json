While this is positive for X, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news is indirect and doesn't provide any substantial information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  The probability of a price change is therefore low in either direction, with the market likely already pricing in the potential for Apple to advertise on X.
