(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report earnings growth, with EPS projected to rise from $2.18 to $2.35 and revenue increasing from $119.6 billion to $124.3 billion. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the actual demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the overall positive earnings forecast but the caution regarding iPhone demand, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of falling if demand disappoints.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings present a mixed picture. While overall revenue and EPS beat estimates, indicating positive financial performance, the significant decline in Greater China revenue is a concern. The strong performance in Europe and Japan, along with beats in Mac and iPad revenue, are positive signals. However, the slight miss in iPhone revenue and the decline in Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue are potential weaknesses. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests a negative outlook from Zacks Investment Research. Considering these factors, the positive earnings surprise is somewhat offset by regional weaknesses and the negative Zacks rating. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race,  it could also be interpreted as a sign of Apple's disciplined approach to spending and a focus on profitability.  The article mentions DeepSeek validating this approach, implying that Apple's strategy might be sound.  The massive AI investments by competitors like Meta represent significant risk and potential for lower returns.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  While some investors might be concerned about Apple's comparatively lower AI spending, others might see it as a positive, reflecting a more conservative and potentially more profitable strategy. The overall market sentiment towards Apple and the tech sector will also play a significant role in determining the stock price movement.  Given the ambiguity, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. The introduction of Apple Intelligence and successful product launches like the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 have positively impacted user engagement and satisfaction. Despite hedge funds reducing their positions in tech stocks due to broader market trends and competition from Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek, AAPL's strong financials and AI advancements suggest resilience. Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, and Apple's strategic positioning in AI could attract investor confidence. However, the broader tech sector selloff and regulatory uncertainties introduce some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that iPhone demand, specifically for the iPhone 16 family, is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. This suggests that the new software feature is driving sales, which is a positive indicator for Apple's revenue and potentially its stock price. CEO Tim Cook's statement that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in these markets further reinforces the positive outlook. Given this information, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will rise as investors react to the news of increased iPhone demand.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple's earnings report, with the company beating expectations on top and bottom lines but showing weakness in iPhone sales and missing revenue estimates in the Greater China region. The analyst's concerns about the next couple of quarters, including the potential lack of game-changing user experiences from on-device AI, elongating replacement cycles, and stalled share gains in China, suggest potential headwinds for the company. However, the fact that Apple still managed to beat earnings expectations suggests some underlying strength. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still possible due to the company's overall strong performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the first quarter, demonstrating stronger-than-expected performance. However, the recent estimate revisions trend is unfavorable, leading to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, suggesting that the shares might underperform the market in the near future. Despite the positive earnings surprise, the market reaction will likely be influenced by management's commentary and future expectations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report earnings growth, with EPS projected to rise from $2.18 to $2.35 and revenue increasing from $119.6 billion to $124.3 billion. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the actual demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. While previous predictions show a range of probabilities, the overall sentiment leans towards a positive outlook due to the earnings growth, despite concerns about iPhone demand. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.6 for the stock price rising and 0.4 for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings present a mixed bag. Revenue and EPS beat estimates, which is generally positive. However, the significant decline in Greater China revenue is a concern, offsetting some of the positive news. Strong performance in Europe and Japan, along with beats in Mac and iPad revenue, are positive signals. The slight miss in iPhone revenue and the decline in Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue are potential weaknesses. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests a negative outlook. Considering the previous round predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning bullish and others bearish. Given the mixed signals and the negative Zacks rank, I'm leaning slightly towards a price fall, but the earnings beat prevents a strong bearish prediction. The fact that the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month also weighs into this decision.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's relatively muted AI spending compared to competitors.  While this could be viewed negatively, suggesting a lack of commitment to a key technological area, it's also framed positively by the mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach. This suggests a more disciplined and potentially profitable strategy, focusing on efficiency rather than aggressive, potentially risky, investment.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning bullish based on positive earnings reports and strong iPhone demand (particularly with Apple Intelligence integration), while others are bearish due to concerns about China revenue, slowing iPhone sales, and the overall tech sector sentiment.  The lack of significant negative news in this specific article, coupled with the potential positive interpretation of the restrained AI spending, suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook. However, the overall market sentiment and future performance will significantly influence the stock price. Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, but acknowledging significant uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration.

Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, and Apple's strategic positioning in AI could attract investor confidence. However, the broader tech sector selloff and regulatory uncertainties introduce some risk. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions and the overall positive outlook tempered by market volatility, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect this balance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that iPhone demand, particularly for the iPhone 16 family, is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. This indicates a positive correlation between the availability of Apple Intelligence and iPhone sales performance. CEO Tim Cook's statement that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in these markets further reinforces the positive outlook. Given this information, it seems that the introduction of Apple Intelligence and its impact on iPhone sales is a significant factor driving the stock price movement. The overall positive sentiment from the CEO's comments and the market's reaction to Apple's AI advancements suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, considering potential market fluctuations and the impact of broader tech trends, there is still a considerable chance that the stock price could fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple's earnings report, with the company beating expectations on top and bottom lines but showing weakness in iPhone sales and missed revenue estimates in the Greater China region. The analyst's concerns about the next couple of quarters, including the potential lack of game-changing user experiences from on-device AI, elongating replacement cycles, and stalled share gains in China, suggest potential headwinds for the company.

(AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the first quarter, which is a strong positive signal. Multiple models suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising, primarily due to the positive earnings report and strong performance metrics. However, there are concerns regarding the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating and potential regional and product segment weaknesses which introduce a degree of uncertainty. The overall positive momentum seems to outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rising.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
