(AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report earnings growth, with EPS projected to rise from $2.18 to $2.35 and revenue increasing from $119.6 billion to $124.3 billion. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the actual demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the overall positive earnings forecast but the caution regarding iPhone demand, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of falling if demand disappoints.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings present a mixed picture. While overall revenue and EPS beat estimates, indicating positive financial performance, the significant decline in Greater China revenue is a concern. The strong performance in Europe and Japan, along with beats in Mac and iPad revenue, are positive signals. However, the slight miss in iPhone revenue and the decline in Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue are potential weaknesses. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests a negative outlook from Zacks Investment Research. Considering these factors, the positive earnings surprise is somewhat offset by regional weaknesses and the negative Zacks rating. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race,  it could also be interpreted as a sign of Apple's disciplined approach to spending and a focus on profitability.  The article mentions DeepSeek validating this approach, implying that Apple's strategy might be sound.  The massive AI investments by competitors like Meta represent significant risk and potential for lower returns.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  While some investors might be concerned about Apple's comparatively lower AI spending, others might see it as a positive, reflecting a more conservative and potentially more profitable strategy. The overall market sentiment towards Apple and the tech sector will also play a significant role in determining the stock price movement.  Given the ambiguity, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. The introduction of Apple Intelligence and successful product launches like the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 have positively impacted user engagement and satisfaction. Despite hedge funds reducing their positions in tech stocks due to broader market trends and competition from Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek, AAPL's strong financials and AI advancements suggest resilience. Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, and Apple's strategic positioning in AI could attract investor confidence. However, the broader tech sector selloff and regulatory uncertainties introduce some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that iPhone demand, specifically for the iPhone 16 family, is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. This suggests that the new software feature is driving sales, which is a positive indicator for Apple's revenue and potentially its stock price. CEO Tim Cook's statement that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in these markets further reinforces the positive outlook. Given this information, it is reasonable to expect that the stock price of Apple Inc. will rise as investors react to the news of increased iPhone demand.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple's earnings report, with the company beating expectations on top and bottom lines but showing weakness in iPhone sales and missing revenue estimates in the Greater China region. The analyst's concerns about the next couple of quarters, including the potential lack of game-changing user experiences from on-device AI, elongating replacement cycles, and stalled share gains in China, suggest potential headwinds for the company. However, the fact that Apple still managed to beat earnings expectations suggests some underlying strength. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still possible due to the company's overall strong performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the first quarter, demonstrating stronger-than-expected performance. However, the recent estimate revisions trend is unfavorable, leading to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, suggesting that the shares might underperform the market in the near future. Despite the positive earnings surprise, the market reaction will likely be influenced by management's commentary and future expectations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
