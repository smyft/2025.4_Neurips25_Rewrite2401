While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race,  it could also be interpreted as a sign of Apple's disciplined approach to spending and a focus on profitability.  The article mentions DeepSeek validating this approach, implying that Apple's strategy might be sound.  The massive AI investments by competitors like Meta represent significant risk and potential for lower returns.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  While some investors might be concerned about Apple's comparatively lower AI spending, others might see it as a positive, reflecting a more conservative and potentially more profitable strategy. The overall market sentiment towards Apple and the tech sector will also play a significant role in determining the stock price movement.  Given the ambiguity, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue.
