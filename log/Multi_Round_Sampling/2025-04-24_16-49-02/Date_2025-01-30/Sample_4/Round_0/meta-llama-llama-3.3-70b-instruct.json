However, the total revenue of the company still showed a 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This suggests that while iPhone sales may be experiencing a slowdown, other segments of the company's business are performing well. Additionally, the article mentions the anticipation of AI payoff, which could potentially lead to future growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the immediate negative impact of the iPhone sales decline.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.42,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.58\n}"
