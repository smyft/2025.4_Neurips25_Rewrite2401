(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the Reserve Bank of Australia's increased scrutiny on liquidity risks within the pension fund sector, which could indicate potential instability in the financial system. While this news is primarily focused on the Australian economy, it may have indirect implications for global markets, including Apple Inc. as a major player in the tech sector. However, the direct impact on Apple is limited, as the company is not directly involved in the Australian pension market. Therefore, the probabilities of significant stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a potential fall due to market uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates Apple's earnings report is scheduled for after the closing bell. This means the current stock price movement will be based on speculation and anticipation of the report. The performance of other tech companies mentioned in the headline is mixed: Tesla's earnings missed but the stock rose due to growth projections, Microsoft's Azure growth missed estimates, and Meta's profit exceeded forecasts. This mixed sentiment creates uncertainty. Given the lack of concrete information about Apple's actual performance, the market reaction will likely depend on pre-earnings expectations and overall market sentiment. A slightly positive bias is given due to Tesla's positive reaction despite missing earnings, suggesting investors are currently more focused on future growth potential. However, the Microsoft miss tempers this optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) concerns about liquidity risks within Australia's large pension fund industry.  The article does not directly mention Apple Inc. or any potential impact on the company.  Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any stock price movement in AAPL would be due to other factors unrelated to this news.  We assume a neutral probability distribution based on the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is aggressively investing in AI. This could be interpreted in two ways: (1) Apple's conservative approach may be seen as a lack of innovation or competitiveness in the AI space, potentially leading to negative sentiment among investors. (2) Alternatively, Apple's strategy might be viewed as disciplined and efficient, avoiding excessive spending on unproven AI ventures, which could be seen positively. Given the current market trend where AI investment is highly valued, the lack of aggressive spending by Apple might lead to more negative sentiment than positive. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance could mitigate some of the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) achieved a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. This positive financial performance, coupled with the company's efforts to enhance user experience through AI-driven features like Apple Intelligence, is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the overall tech sector selloff and concerns about future growth due to international competition and regulatory uncertainties may temper the stock's rise. Despite these challenges, the company's strong financials and dominant position in the tech industry suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple. However, the total revenue of the company still showed a 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This suggests that while iPhone sales may be experiencing a slowdown, other segments of the company's business are performing well. Additionally, the article mentions the anticipation of AI payoff, which could potentially lead to future growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the immediate negative impact of the iPhone sales decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including AI spending, cost-cutting measures, and the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. For Apple specifically, there is mention of potential tepid revenue growth and mixed reviews on AI features, which might impact investor sentiment negatively. However, it is noted that Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers. Overall, the tech sector seems to be recovering slightly with futures higher, but specific concerns for Apple may temper this positive trend.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia's scrutiny on pension fund liquidity risks primarily focuses on the Australian financial system and does not directly impact Apple Inc. However, the potential for financial instability in Australia could create broader market uncertainty, which may indirectly affect investor sentiment towards global companies like Apple. Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds, with some indicating a slight bias towards falling prices due to market uncertainty, I estimate a balanced probability with a slight inclination towards a fall in stock price due to the potential for negative sentiment in the broader market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report, creating uncertainty. The performance of other tech companies is mixed (Tesla up on growth projections despite earnings miss, Microsoft down on Azure miss, Meta up on earnings beat). This mixed sentiment makes it difficult to predict Apple's stock movement. The previous rounds of predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models focusing on AI investment and others on iPhone sales. Given the mixed signals and the fact that the earnings report is pending, I'll slightly favor a rise, as the market often anticipates positive news leading up to earnings. However, the mixed performance of other tech giants tempers this optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's concerns regarding liquidity risks in Australia's pension fund industry.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple's business operations and financial performance.  The Australian pension fund situation might indirectly impact global markets through broader economic uncertainty, but the connection to Apple is tenuous at best.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the lack of direct impact of this news on Apple's stock price.  Given the weak connection, I'm assigning probabilities close to neutral, slightly favoring a probability of no change, as the news is unlikely to significantly influence investor sentiment towards Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's relatively muted spending on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is aggressively investing in AI.

This suggests that while iPhone sales may be experiencing a slowdown, other segments of the company's business are performing well. Additionally, the article mentions the anticipation of AI payoff, which could potentially lead to future growth. Considering the mixed sentiment from other models, with some predicting a rise due to future growth potential and others predicting a fall due to the immediate negative impact of the iPhone sales decline, the probabilities of the stock price movement are relatively balanced. However, given the slight decline in iPhone sales and the mixed reviews on AI features, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including AI spending, cost-cutting measures, and the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
