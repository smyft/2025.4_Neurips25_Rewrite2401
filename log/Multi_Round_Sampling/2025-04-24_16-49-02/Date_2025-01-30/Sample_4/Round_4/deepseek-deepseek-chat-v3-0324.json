      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue. DeepSeek Validates the Approach.\nNews Content: Apple continues to spend less than its Magnificent 7 peers on artificial intelligence. American tech companies have spent billions of dollars on developing generative artificial intelligence projects, with plans to spend much more. Facebook parent Meta Platforms said last week that Meta is planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year while significantly increasing the size of the company\u2019s AI teams.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the Reserve Bank of Australia's increased scrutiny on liquidity risks within the pension fund sector, which could indicate potential instability in the financial system. While this news is primarily focused on the Australian economy, it may have indirect implications for global markets, including Apple Inc. as a major player in the tech sector. However, the direct impact on Apple is limited, as the company is not directly involved in the Australian pension market. Therefore, the probabilities of significant stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a potential fall due to market uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates Apple's earnings report is scheduled for after the closing bell. This means the current stock price movement will be based on speculation and anticipation of the report. The performance of other tech companies mentioned in the headline is mixed: Tesla's earnings missed but the stock rose due to growth projections, Microsoft's Azure growth missed estimates, and Meta's profit exceeded forecasts. This mixed sentiment creates uncertainty. Given the lack of concrete information about Apple's actual performance, the market reaction will likely depend on pre-earnings expectations and overall market sentiment. A slightly positive bias is given due to Tesla's positive reaction despite missing earnings, suggesting investors are currently more focused on future growth potential. However, the Microsoft miss tempers this optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) concerns about liquidity risks within Australia's large pension fund industry.  The article does not directly mention Apple Inc. or any potential impact on the company.  Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any stock price movement in AAPL would be due to other factors unrelated to this news.  We assume a neutral probability distribution based on the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is aggressively investing in AI. This could be interpreted in two ways: (1) Apple's conservative approach may be seen as a lack of innovation or competitiveness in the AI space, potentially leading to negative sentiment among investors. (2) Alternatively, Apple's strategy might be viewed as disciplined and efficient, avoiding excessive spending on unproven AI ventures, which could be seen positively. Given the current market trend where AI investment is highly valued, the lack of aggressive spending by Apple might lead to more negative sentiment than positive. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance could mitigate some of the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) achieved a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. This positive financial performance, coupled with the company's efforts to enhance user experience through AI-driven features like Apple Intelligence, is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the overall tech sector selloff and concerns about future growth due to international competition and regulatory uncertainties may temper the stock's rise. Despite these challenges, the company's strong financials and dominant position in the tech industry suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple. However, the total revenue of the company still showed a 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This suggests that while iPhone sales may be experiencing a slowdown, other segments of the company's business are performing well. Additionally, the article mentions the anticipation of AI payoff, which could potentially lead to future growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the immediate negative impact of the iPhone sales decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including AI spending, cost-cutting measures, and the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. For Apple specifically, there is mention of potential tepid revenue growth and mixed reviews on AI features, which might impact investor sentiment negatively. However, it is noted that Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers. Overall, the tech sector seems to be recovering slightly with futures higher, but specific concerns for Apple may temper this positive trend.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia's scrutiny on pension fund liquidity risks primarily focuses on the Australian financial system and does not directly impact Apple Inc. However, the potential for financial instability in Australia could create broader market uncertainty, which may indirectly affect investor sentiment towards global companies like Apple. Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds, with some indicating a slight bias towards falling prices due to market uncertainty, I estimate a balanced probability with a slight inclination towards a fall in stock price due to the potential for negative sentiment in the broader market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report, creating uncertainty. The performance of other tech companies is mixed (Tesla up on growth projections despite earnings miss, Microsoft down on Azure miss, Meta up on earnings beat). This mixed sentiment makes it difficult to predict Apple's stock movement. The previous rounds of predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models focusing on AI investment and others on iPhone sales. Given the mixed signals and the fact that the earnings report is pending, I'll slightly favor a rise, as the market often anticipates positive news leading up to earnings. However, the mixed performance of other tech giants tempers this optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's concerns regarding liquidity risks in Australia's pension fund industry.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple's business operations and financial performance.  The Australian pension fund situation might indirectly impact global markets through broader economic uncertainty, but the connection to Apple is tenuous at best.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the lack of direct impact of this news on Apple's stock price.  Given the weak connection, I'm assigning probabilities close to neutral, slightly favoring a probability of no change, as the news is unlikely to significantly influence investor sentiment towards Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's relatively muted spending on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is aggressively investing in AI.

Additionally, the article mentions the anticipation of AI payoff, which could potentially lead to future growth. Considering the mixed sentiment from other models, with some predicting a rise due to future growth potential and others predicting a fall due to the immediate negative impact of the iPhone sales decline, the probabilities of the stock price movement are relatively balanced. However, given the slight decline in iPhone sales and the mixed reviews on AI features, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including AI spending, cost-cutting measures, and the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.

However, it is noted that Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers. Overall, the tech sector seems to be recovering slightly with futures higher, but specific concerns for Apple may temper this positive trend. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments from bearish to bullish, with most predictions leaning towards a slight bearish sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia's scrutiny on pension fund liquidity risks primarily focuses on the Australian financial system and does not directly impact Apple Inc.

The performance of other tech companies is mixed: Tesla rose despite an earnings miss due to growth projections, Microsoft's Azure growth missed estimates, and Meta's profit exceeded forecasts. This creates uncertainty. Previous predictions are varied, reflecting this uncertainty, with some focusing on AI investment and others on iPhone sales. Given the mixed signals and the impending earnings report, I'll lean slightly towards a rise, as markets often anticipate positive news before earnings. However, Microsoft's miss tempers this optimism. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which show a slight increase in bearish sentiment, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's concerns about liquidity risks in the Australian pension fund system. This is largely irrelevant to Apple's business.  There's no direct connection between the Australian pension fund situation and Apple's stock price. Any impact would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader global market uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the lack of direct impact.  The consensus leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily due to general market uncertainty rather than anything specific to Apple.  Given the weak connection and the mixed predictions, I'm assigning probabilities close to neutral, with a slight bias towards no change, as the news is unlikely to significantly influence investor sentiment towards Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's relatively lower spending on AI compared to its peers, which could be interpreted both positively (disciplined spending) and negatively (lack of innovation). Given the current market trend where AI investment is highly valued, the lack of aggressive spending by Apple might lead to more negative sentiment than positive. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance could mitigate some of the downside. Considering the mixed interpretations and the overall market sentiment, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. Additionally, previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with a slight lean towards bearish sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.46, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.54, Reasoning: The news reports a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, but the total revenue of the company still showed a 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This suggests that while iPhone sales may be experiencing a slowdown, other segments of the company's business are performing well. Additionally, the article mentions the anticipation of AI payoff, which could potentially lead to future growth. Considering the mixed sentiment from other models, with some predicting a rise due to future growth potential and others predicting a fall due to the immediate negative impact of the iPhone sales decline, the probabilities of the stock price movement are relatively balanced. However, given the slight decline in iPhone sales and the mixed reviews on AI features, I estimate a probability of the stock price rising as 0.46 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.54.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including AI spending, cost-cutting measures, and the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. For Apple specifically, there is mention of potential tepid revenue growth and mixed reviews on AI features, which might impact investor sentiment negatively. However, it is noted that Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers.

The news highlights mixed performance from other tech giants: Tesla's positive reaction to growth projections despite an earnings miss, Microsoft's Azure growth miss, and Meta's profit exceeding forecasts. This creates uncertainty. Previous predictions show a trend towards slightly increased bearish sentiment, likely due to concerns about tepid revenue growth and mixed reviews on AI features mentioned in earlier news. Considering the mixed signals and the impending earnings report, I'll maintain a slightly bearish stance, but temper it slightly due to the potential for positive surprises in Apple's report. The market's reaction will heavily depend on the actual earnings and forward guidance provided by Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's concerns about liquidity risks in the Australian pension fund system. This news is largely irrelevant to Apple's business and financial performance.  Any impact on Apple's stock price would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader global market uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the lack of direct impact.  There's a slight bearish trend in the previous predictions, likely due to general market uncertainty rather than anything specific to Apple.  Considering the weak connection between the news and Apple, and the mixed and slightly bearish sentiment from previous predictions, I'm assigning probabilities close to neutral, with a slight bias towards a price fall, reflecting the overall market uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's relatively muted spending on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is aggressively investing in AI.
