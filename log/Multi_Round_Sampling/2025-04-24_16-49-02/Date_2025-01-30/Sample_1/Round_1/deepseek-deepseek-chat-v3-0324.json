(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Compared to Estimates, Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: A Look at Key Metrics\nNews Content: For the quarter ended December 2024, Apple (AAPL) reported revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% over the same period last year.

(AAPL) : Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a critical revenue driver for Apple. The reported sales of $69.1 billion fell short of analyst expectations of $70.7 billion, suggesting weaker demand than anticipated. Although total revenue increased by almost 4%, the focus on iPhone sales and the mention of investors awaiting AI developments may create uncertainty. This could lead to a negative sentiment among investors, increasing the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increasing scrutiny on Australian pension fund liquidity risks. While this doesn't directly impact Apple (AAPL), there are indirect potential effects. A significant financial shock in Australia could lead to a global market downturn, potentially affecting Apple's stock price negatively. However, Apple is a large, multinational company with diverse revenue streams, making it relatively resilient to localized economic issues. The news doesn't mention Apple directly, and the connection is indirect. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal in the short term. The probabilities are assigned based on this indirect and potentially weak connection.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is positive, with futures pointing upwards.  However, the news regarding Apple is mixed. While the broader tech sector is showing some resilience in the face of concerns about AI spending (Microsoft and Meta's responses to the DeepSeek model), Apple's own AI initiatives have received mixed reviews, and tepid revenue growth is anticipated.  Apple's less aggressive AI investment compared to its peers could be seen as either a positive (avoiding excessive spending) or a negative (missing out on potential growth). The Fed's decision to hold rates steady could be slightly positive for the market, but the lack of rate cuts might temper enthusiasm. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, but both probabilities are relatively close to 0.5, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 earnings report reveals mixed results. While the company reported a slight revenue and EPS beat compared to consensus estimates, there are notable regional and product segment variances. Positive surprises in Europe, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific, Americas, Mac, iPad, and Services segments suggest strength in these areas. However, significant misses in Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories, along with a slight miss in iPhone revenue, could raise concerns. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently and holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential near-term underperformance. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly negative due to the mixed performance and the current market rating.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the stock market in 2025. Tom Lee's optimistic yet cautious forecast for the S&P 500, along with the mention of Apple's strong performance and potential for AI-driven services, suggests a favorable environment for the company's stock. However, the article also mentions challenges such as Apple's declining shipments in China and the potential risks in the market. Despite these challenges, the overall tone and the ranking of AAPL as the 3rd best stock to buy in 2025 for beginners imply a positive sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone demand is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, suggesting a positive impact on iPhone sales. This information, shared by CEO Tim Cook, implies that the new features and technologies, such as Apple Intelligence, are well-received by consumers, which could lead to increased sales and revenue for the company. As a result, the stock price is likely to rise due to this positive news. The fact that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in areas where Apple Intelligence is available further supports this positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has exceeded both revenue and earnings estimates for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue was reported at $124.3 billion, beating the $124 billion estimate, and EPS was $2.40, surpassing the $2.36 estimate. This suggests strong financial performance which typically leads to positive stock movements. However, there are concerns in specific geographic regions like Greater China where revenues were lower than expected, and some product categories such as Wearables, Home, and Accessories missed estimates slightly. Despite these minor misses, the overall positive beat on revenue and earnings is likely to outweigh these negatives. Additionally, the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating suggests potential short-term underperformance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
