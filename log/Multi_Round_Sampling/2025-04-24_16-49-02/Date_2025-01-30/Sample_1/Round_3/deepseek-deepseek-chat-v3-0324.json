(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Compared to Estimates, Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: A Look at Key Metrics\nNews Content: For the quarter ended December 2024, Apple (AAPL) reported revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% over the same period last year. EPS came in at $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.24% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.36, the EPS surprise was +1.69%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China: $18.51 billion compared to the $22.16 billion average estimate based on two analysts.

The reported number represents a change of +15.7% year over year. Geographic Revenue- Americas: $52.65 billion compared to the $52.23 billion average estimate based on two analysts.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a critical revenue driver for Apple. The reported sales of $69.1 billion fell short of analyst expectations of $70.7 billion, suggesting weaker demand than anticipated. Although total revenue increased by almost 4%, the focus on iPhone sales and the mention of investors awaiting AI developments may create uncertainty. This could lead to a negative sentiment among investors, increasing the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increasing scrutiny on Australian pension fund liquidity risks. While this doesn't directly impact Apple (AAPL), there are indirect potential effects. A significant financial shock in Australia could lead to a global market downturn, potentially affecting Apple's stock price negatively. However, Apple is a large, multinational company with diverse revenue streams, making it relatively resilient to localized economic issues. The news doesn't mention Apple directly, and the connection is indirect. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal in the short term. The probabilities are assigned based on this indirect and potentially weak connection.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is positive, with futures pointing upwards.  However, the news regarding Apple is mixed. While the broader tech sector is showing some resilience in the face of concerns about AI spending (Microsoft and Meta's responses to the DeepSeek model), Apple's own AI initiatives have received mixed reviews, and tepid revenue growth is anticipated.  Apple's less aggressive AI investment compared to its peers could be seen as either a positive (avoiding excessive spending) or a negative (missing out on potential growth). The Fed's decision to hold rates steady could be slightly positive for the market, but the lack of rate cuts might temper enthusiasm. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, but both probabilities are relatively close to 0.5, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 earnings report reveals mixed results. While the company reported a slight revenue and EPS beat compared to consensus estimates, there are notable regional and product segment variances. Positive surprises in Europe, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific, Americas, Mac, iPad, and Services segments suggest strength in these areas. However, significant misses in Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories, along with a slight miss in iPhone revenue, could raise concerns. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently and holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential near-term underperformance. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly negative due to the mixed performance and the current market rating.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the stock market in 2025. Tom Lee's optimistic yet cautious forecast for the S&P 500, along with the mention of Apple's strong performance and potential for AI-driven services, suggests a favorable environment for the company's stock. However, the article also mentions challenges such as Apple's declining shipments in China and the potential risks in the market. Despite these challenges, the overall tone and the ranking of AAPL as the 3rd best stock to buy in 2025 for beginners imply a positive sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone demand is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, suggesting a positive impact on iPhone sales. This information, shared by CEO Tim Cook, implies that the new features and technologies, such as Apple Intelligence, are well-received by consumers, which could lead to increased sales and revenue for the company. As a result, the stock price is likely to rise due to this positive news. The fact that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in areas where Apple Intelligence is available further supports this positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has exceeded both revenue and earnings estimates for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue was reported at $124.3 billion, beating the $124 billion estimate, and EPS was $2.40, surpassing the $2.36 estimate. This suggests strong financial performance which typically leads to positive stock movements. However, there are concerns in specific geographic regions like Greater China where revenues were lower than expected, and some product categories such as Wearables, Home, and Accessories missed estimates slightly. Despite these minor misses, the overall positive beat on revenue and earnings is likely to outweigh these negatives. Additionally, the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating suggests potential short-term underperformance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a critical revenue driver for Apple. The reported sales fell short of analyst expectations, suggesting weaker demand. While total revenue increased, the focus on iPhone sales and the mention of investors awaiting AI developments create uncertainty, likely leading to negative sentiment among investors. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning towards a slight probability of decline due to mixed results and concerns in specific regions. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) increased scrutiny of Australian pension fund liquidity risks. This is an indirect factor for Apple (AAPL). While a significant financial shock in Australia could potentially lead to a global market downturn, affecting Apple's stock negatively, Apple is a large, multinational company with diverse revenue streams, making it relatively resilient to localized economic issues. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is a wide range of opinions, with some focusing on Apple's specific performance and others on broader market trends. Given the indirect nature of the news and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a more neutral stance, leaning slightly towards a potential negative impact due to the increased financial scrutiny.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While overall market futures are positive, and some tech giants are defending their AI investments, Apple's AI initiatives have received mixed reviews, and revenue growth is expected to be tepid.  The lack of significant rate cuts by the Fed could dampen enthusiasm.  Apple's less aggressive AI investment is a double-edged sword \u2013 it could be seen as prudent cost management or a missed opportunity. The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance. Considering the mixed signals and the relatively muted response to Apple's AI offerings, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than a price fall, but both are relatively close to 0.5, reflecting the significant uncertainty.  The overall market positivity provides a slight upward bias, but the specific concerns regarding Apple's performance outweigh this.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company reported revenue and EPS that slightly exceeded consensus estimates, with revenue at $124.3 billion (a +0.24% surprise) and EPS at $2.40 (a +1.69% surprise). Strong performances in Europe, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific, Americas, Mac, iPad, and Services segments further bolster the positive outlook. However, significant misses in Greater China (-11.1% year-over-year) and Wearables, Home and Accessories (-1.7% year-over-year), along with a slight miss in iPhone revenue (-0.8% year-over-year), could raise concerns. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently (-4.4% over the past month) and holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential near-term underperformance. Given these mixed signals, the overall sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, but the slight beats on revenue and EPS may provide some support.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the stock market in 2025. Tom Lee's optimistic forecast for the S&P 500 and the mention of Apple's strong performance and potential for AI-driven services suggest a favorable environment for the company's stock. However, there are also challenges mentioned, such as Apple's declining shipments in China. Despite these challenges, the overall tone implies a positive sentiment, with Apple's stock ranked as the 3rd best to buy in 2025 for beginners. The forecasted growth rate of 6% for 2025 and the expansive platform for AI services also contribute to a positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone demand is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, suggesting a positive impact on iPhone sales.

Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising and others a higher probability of it falling, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly towards a positive outlook due to the specific mention of iPhone strength in markets with Apple Intelligence. However, the varied predictions also reflect the uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative reactions to the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.

Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) increased scrutiny of Australian pension fund liquidity risks. This is an indirect factor for Apple (AAPL). A significant financial shock in Australia could potentially lead to a global market downturn, affecting Apple's stock negatively. However, Apple is a large, multinational company with diverse revenue streams, making it relatively resilient to localized economic issues. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is a wide range of opinions, with some focusing on Apple's specific performance and others on broader market trends. The previous round's predictions ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 for stock price rising. Given the indirect nature of the news and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a more neutral stance, leaning slightly towards a potential negative impact due to the increased financial scrutiny. I will also consider the trend of the previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall market sentiment is positive, with futures pointing upwards and some tech giants defending their AI investments, Apple's situation is more nuanced.  Apple's upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show tepid revenue growth, and its AI initiatives have received mixed reviews.  The less aggressive AI investment compared to peers is a double-edged sword.  The Fed's decision to hold rates steady is neither strongly positive nor negative.  Considering the previous predictions, there's significant uncertainty.  While the overall market positivity provides a slight upward bias, the specific concerns regarding Apple's performance, particularly the tepid revenue growth and mixed AI reception, outweigh this. The slight beat on revenue and EPS in the previous quarter offers some support, but the concerns about China and specific product categories remain.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, reflecting the uncertainty and the potential for negative reactions to the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc.
