(AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

(AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company emerges as a prime investment opportunity for several reasons. First and foremost, the company\u2019s robust financial health is depicted in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue was $94.9 billion, increasing 6% year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share was $0.97. This shows the increasing demand for the company\u2019s products or services and its ability to generate earnings for shareholders. Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2024, the company declared quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, totaling $0.96 per share annually. Secondly, the company has also introduced a general health-monitoring tool in all its new devices. For instance, an Apple Watch can monitor heart rate, check for atrial fibrillation, detect falls and car crashes, monitor blood-oxygen levels, and track body temperature for fertility planning.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment towards the stock. Such downgrades can lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially resulting in selling pressure. Given the significance of the downgrade and its rarity, it is likely to have a more pronounced effect on the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall earnings season is strong and Apple's Q4 margins are expected to be modestly up, the stock has underperformed, losing 15% since its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Analyst sentiment is somewhat bearish, with some projecting a guidance cut and estimates for future fiscal years being revised downwards. However, bulls believe the China issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce an AI partnership soon. The article also highlights the strong performance of other Mag 7 companies, particularly Tesla, which could indirectly influence investor sentiment towards the tech sector as a whole. Given the negative sentiment and downward revisions, a price fall is slightly more probable, but the potential for a positive earnings surprise or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a rise significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While the overall market sentiment is positive, with strong Q4 earnings expectations for the S&P 500 and the 'Magnificent 7', Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market performance and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, putting downward pressure on the stock. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships with Chinese AI companies as a positive factor.  The article highlights that Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve, which is a positive sign. Considering the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools are highlighted. The company's resilience in bear markets and its position as a top pick among hedge funds add to its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the tech sector could negatively impact the stock. The article also mentions historical patterns where surges in foreign investment preceded market downturns, adding a layer of caution. Given these factors, the stock has a balanced probability of rising or falling, with a slight edge towards stability or modest growth due to Apple's defensive attributes and strong ecosystem.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any specific information that could impact its stock price. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF and does not specifically focus on or mention Apple Inc. Therefore, it's unlikely that this news will have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as minimal. The probabilities are roughly equal, with a slight inclination towards no change, but for the purpose of this task, I will assign them as close to equal as possible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the profitability of streaming services, particularly Netflix, and the challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent profits. While the article highlights the progress made by these companies, it also notes the concerns about retaining customer base, combating increased churn, and the limitations of raising prices. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as a major player in the streaming wars, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, as a major player in the technology and entertainment industry, AAPL may be indirectly affected by the trends and developments in the streaming market. Considering the overall positive tone of the article regarding the profitability of streaming services, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential positive impact on the technology and entertainment industry as a whole.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that a well-known investor, Steven Cohen, has sold his Apple stock and has invested in a different AI stock instead. This could suggest a negative sentiment towards Apple's future performance from a prominent investor. However, it's important to note that such decisions can be influenced by various factors, including portfolio diversification, personal investment strategies, and specific market opportunities. The market's reaction may not necessarily align with Cohen's actions, especially considering Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and diverse product ecosystem.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment and can lead to decreased investor confidence. This downgrade is significant given its rarity, suggesting a strong likelihood of selling pressure. Previous predictions show a trend towards bearish sentiment, with most analysts leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. While there are some mixed signals regarding Apple's financial health and potential future partnerships, the overall impact of the downgrade is likely to dominate investor sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be strong, Apple's stock has been lagging, down 15% from its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Some analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downwards. However, bulls believe the China issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce an AI partnership soon. The fact that other models in previous rounds have predicted a higher probability of the stock falling suggests that there may be some negative information about the stock that is not explicitly stated in the article. Considering the negative sentiment and downward revisions, a price fall is slightly more probable, but the potential for a positive earnings surprise or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a rise significant. Given the previous rounds' predictions, I will adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.

The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning towards a price fall and others towards a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the uncertainty surrounding the China market and AI strategy, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the current bearish sentiment and the risk of a guidance cut. However, the potential for positive surprises related to AI partnerships and margin improvement keeps the probability of a rise significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

This decision might reflect his negative sentiment towards Apple's future performance. Previous predictions show a general bearish trend with probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.75 for the stock price falling. The news reinforces this sentiment as Steven Cohen, known for his expertise in investments, is choosing to divest from Apple. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the selling pressure may increase, leading to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment and can lead to decreased investor confidence.

The consistent downward revision of EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025 is a significant negative factor. While the potential for a positive earnings surprise or AI partnership announcement exists, the weight of negative sentiment and the risk of a guidance cut suggest a higher probability of a price fall.

The majority of previous predictions show a bearish trend, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.75 for the stock price falling. This news reinforces the existing bearish sentiment, as a prominent investor like Steven Cohen is choosing to divest from Apple.
