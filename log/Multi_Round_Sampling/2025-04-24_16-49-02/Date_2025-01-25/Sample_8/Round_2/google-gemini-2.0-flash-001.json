(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment towards the stock. Such downgrades can lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially resulting in selling pressure. Given the significance of the downgrade and its rarity, it is likely to have a more pronounced effect on the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall earnings season is strong and Apple's Q4 margins are expected to be modestly up, the stock has underperformed, losing 15% since its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Analyst sentiment is somewhat bearish, with some projecting a guidance cut and estimates for future fiscal years being revised downwards. However, bulls believe the China issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce an AI partnership soon. The article also highlights the strong performance of other Mag 7 companies, particularly Tesla, which could indirectly influence investor sentiment towards the tech sector as a whole. Given the negative sentiment and downward revisions, a price fall is slightly more probable, but the potential for a positive earnings surprise or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a rise significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While the overall market sentiment is positive, with strong Q4 earnings expectations for the S&P 500 and the 'Magnificent 7', Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market performance and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, putting downward pressure on the stock. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships with Chinese AI companies as a positive factor.  The article highlights that Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve, which is a positive sign. Considering the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools are highlighted. The company's resilience in bear markets and its position as a top pick among hedge funds add to its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the tech sector could negatively impact the stock. The article also mentions historical patterns where surges in foreign investment preceded market downturns, adding a layer of caution. Given these factors, the stock has a balanced probability of rising or falling, with a slight edge towards stability or modest growth due to Apple's defensive attributes and strong ecosystem.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any specific information that could impact its stock price. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF and does not specifically focus on or mention Apple Inc. Therefore, it's unlikely that this news will have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as minimal. The probabilities are roughly equal, with a slight inclination towards no change, but for the purpose of this task, I will assign them as close to equal as possible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the profitability of streaming services, particularly Netflix, and the challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent profits. While the article highlights the progress made by these companies, it also notes the concerns about retaining customer base, combating increased churn, and the limitations of raising prices. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as a major player in the streaming wars, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, as a major player in the technology and entertainment industry, AAPL may be indirectly affected by the trends and developments in the streaming market. Considering the overall positive tone of the article regarding the profitability of streaming services, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential positive impact on the technology and entertainment industry as a whole.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that a well-known investor, Steven Cohen, has sold his Apple stock and has invested in a different AI stock instead. This could suggest a negative sentiment towards Apple's future performance from a prominent investor. However, it's important to note that such decisions can be influenced by various factors, including portfolio diversification, personal investment strategies, and specific market opportunities. The market's reaction may not necessarily align with Cohen's actions, especially considering Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and diverse product ecosystem.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment and can lead to decreased investor confidence. This downgrade is significant given its rarity, suggesting a strong likelihood of selling pressure. Previous predictions show a trend towards bearish sentiment, with most analysts leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. While there are some mixed signals regarding Apple's financial health and potential future partnerships, the overall impact of the downgrade is likely to dominate investor sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be strong, Apple's stock has been lagging, down 15% from its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Some analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downwards. However, bulls believe the China issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce an AI partnership soon. The fact that other models in previous rounds have predicted a higher probability of the stock falling suggests that there may be some negative information about the stock that is not explicitly stated in the article. Considering the negative sentiment and downward revisions, a price fall is slightly more probable, but the potential for a positive earnings surprise or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a rise significant. Given the previous rounds' predictions, I will adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the overall market sentiment is positive, with strong Q4 earnings expectations for the S&P 500 and the 'Magnificent 7', Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market performance and AI strategy. Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, putting downward pressure on the stock. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships with Chinese AI companies as a positive factor.  Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve, which is a positive sign.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning towards a price fall and others towards a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the uncertainty surrounding the China market and AI strategy, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the current bearish sentiment and the risk of a guidance cut. However, the potential for positive surprises related to AI partnerships and margin improvement keeps the probability of a rise significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

This decision might reflect his negative sentiment towards Apple's future performance. Previous predictions show a general bearish trend with probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.75 for the stock price falling. The news reinforces this sentiment as Steven Cohen, known for his expertise in investments, is choosing to divest from Apple. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the selling pressure may increase, leading to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
