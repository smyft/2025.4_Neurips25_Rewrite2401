Wall Street's biggest worry is whether momentum can last.\nNews Content: For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.\n\nIn 2024, that finally changed.\n\nThe five giants \u2014 Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) \u2014 collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNetflix led the charge, pulling in roughly $6.9 billion in earnings in the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the company the unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reported an additional $1.87 billion in profits to end the fourth quarter \u2014 and nearly 20 million more subscribers.\n\nThe other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.\n\nLast year delivered some early answers. Disney and Paramount Global each reported their first quarter of streaming profits in August. Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as \"progress,\" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.\n\nFor Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is \"the pace of revenue growth.\" He added, \"To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.\"\n\nFor traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. \"Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.\n\nThat low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns. Lourdes Balduque via Getty Images\n\nIn response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers through controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.\n\nCompanies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.\n\n\"Everything was kind of messy for a few years,\" Macquarie's Nollen said. \"Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.\"\n\n(edited)\n\nOne obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. (Netflix became the latest platform to boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)\n\n\"The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,\" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, \"there's a limit\" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.\n\n\"Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,\" he said.\n\nTo combat fickle subscribers, competing platforms are now bundling their services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, \"There's more strength together.\"\n\n\"I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,\" Dolgin said. \"So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.\"\n\nAnd if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix \u2014 and just basic survival in the streaming-first era \u2014 might be a bumpy one.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NFLX)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment towards the stock. Such downgrades can lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially resulting in selling pressure. Given the significance of the downgrade and its rarity, it is likely to have a more pronounced effect on the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall earnings season is strong and Apple's Q4 margins are expected to be modestly up, the stock has underperformed, losing 15% since its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Analyst sentiment is somewhat bearish, with some projecting a guidance cut and estimates for future fiscal years being revised downwards. However, bulls believe the China issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce an AI partnership soon. The article also highlights the strong performance of other Mag 7 companies, particularly Tesla, which could indirectly influence investor sentiment towards the tech sector as a whole. Given the negative sentiment and downward revisions, a price fall is slightly more probable, but the potential for a positive earnings surprise or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a rise significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While the overall market sentiment is positive, with strong Q4 earnings expectations for the S&P 500 and the 'Magnificent 7', Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market performance and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, putting downward pressure on the stock. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships with Chinese AI companies as a positive factor.  The article highlights that Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve, which is a positive sign. Considering the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools are highlighted. The company's resilience in bear markets and its position as a top pick among hedge funds add to its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the tech sector could negatively impact the stock. The article also mentions historical patterns where surges in foreign investment preceded market downturns, adding a layer of caution. Given these factors, the stock has a balanced probability of rising or falling, with a slight edge towards stability or modest growth due to Apple's defensive attributes and strong ecosystem.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any specific information that could impact its stock price. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF and does not specifically focus on or mention Apple Inc. Therefore, it's unlikely that this news will have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as minimal. The probabilities are roughly equal, with a slight inclination towards no change, but for the purpose of this task, I will assign them as close to equal as possible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the profitability of streaming services, particularly Netflix, and the challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent profits. While the article highlights the progress made by these companies, it also notes the concerns about retaining customer base, combating increased churn, and the limitations of raising prices. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as a major player in the streaming wars, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, as a major player in the technology and entertainment industry, AAPL may be indirectly affected by the trends and developments in the streaming market. Considering the overall positive tone of the article regarding the profitability of streaming services, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential positive impact on the technology and entertainment industry as a whole.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that a well-known investor, Steven Cohen, has sold his Apple stock and has invested in a different AI stock instead. This could suggest a negative sentiment towards Apple's future performance from a prominent investor. However, it's important to note that such decisions can be influenced by various factors, including portfolio diversification, personal investment strategies, and specific market opportunities. The market's reaction may not necessarily align with Cohen's actions, especially considering Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and diverse product ecosystem.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment and can lead to decreased investor confidence. This downgrade is significant given its rarity, suggesting a strong likelihood of selling pressure. Previous predictions show a trend towards bearish sentiment, with most analysts leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. While there are some mixed signals regarding Apple's financial health and potential future partnerships, the overall impact of the downgrade is likely to dominate investor sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be strong, Apple's stock has been lagging, down 15% from its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Some analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downwards. However, bulls believe the China issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce an AI partnership soon. The fact that other models in previous rounds have predicted a higher probability of the stock falling suggests that there may be some negative information about the stock that is not explicitly stated in the article. Considering the negative sentiment and downward revisions, a price fall is slightly more probable, but the potential for a positive earnings surprise or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a rise significant. Given the previous rounds' predictions, I will adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.

The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning towards a price fall and others towards a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the uncertainty surrounding the China market and AI strategy, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the current bearish sentiment and the risk of a guidance cut. However, the potential for positive surprises related to AI partnerships and margin improvement keeps the probability of a rise significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

This decision might reflect his negative sentiment towards Apple's future performance. Previous predictions show a general bearish trend with probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.75 for the stock price falling. The news reinforces this sentiment as Steven Cohen, known for his expertise in investments, is choosing to divest from Apple. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the selling pressure may increase, leading to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
