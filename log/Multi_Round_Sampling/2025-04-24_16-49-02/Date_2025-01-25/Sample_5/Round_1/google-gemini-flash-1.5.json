(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?\nNews Content: In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It Time to Sell the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms and highlights Apple's inclusion in the emerging BATMMAAN group, which suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple as part of a strong cohort of tech stocks. The historical performance of these groupings has generally been favorable, which could lead to increased investor confidence in AAPL. However, the overall market conditions and upcoming earnings reports could also influence stock movements. Given the context, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the evolution of mega-cap stock groupings and Apple's continued presence in these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN). This suggests Apple remains a dominant and influential player in the tech market. While the article doesn't directly discuss Apple's financial performance or specific product releases, the consistent inclusion in these elite groups implies sustained market relevance and investor confidence. The comparison of returns across different groupings could indirectly influence investor sentiment, but the primary takeaway is Apple's enduring position. Therefore, the news is slightly positive, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall. However, the effect is likely to be small, as the news is more about market categorization than Apple-specific performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a rare underperform rating from Jefferies and concerns about weak iPhone shipments and AI feature adoption are bearish factors,  Apple's strong services revenue growth and high margins offer a counterpoint.  The analyst's price target of $200.75 is below the current price (this would need to be determined from external data to give a precise analysis), suggesting a potential downside. However, the article also highlights Apple's robust business model and the potential for long-term growth in its services sector. The uncertainty surrounding the Alphabet antitrust case adds further complexity. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's overall strength and the potential for the market to disregard a single analyst's opinion, especially given the bullish nature of the overall market sentiment towards Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by 20% based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current share price of $223. The DCF model, while not without flaws, is a widely respected valuation method. The article also notes that the fair value estimate is 13% higher than the analyst price target of $246, indicating potential upside. Given the positive valuation gap and the general market tendency to correct undervaluation over time, there is a reasonable probability that the stock price could rise. However, the DCF model's assumptions (e.g., growth rates, discount rate) are critical and could be challenged, which introduces some uncertainty. The article also highlights risks such as slower earnings growth and low dividends, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the undervaluation signal is strong, but market reactions can be influenced by broader factors not accounted for in the DCF.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Some bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut for Apple, while bulls believe the sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Given the current downbeat sentiment and stable estimates for the December quarter, there is a potential for the stock price to rise if Apple's earnings report meets or exceeds expectations, and for it to fall if the report is disappointing or if a guidance cut is announced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact stock prices. The report will likely include information about the company's performance in the artificial intelligence sector, which is a central theme in the Big Tech earnings reports. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday can also influence the stock market. Historically, the release of quarterly earnings reports can lead to stock price volatility. Given that Apple is a well-established company with a strong track record, the release of its earnings report may lead to a positive reaction from investors, especially if the report meets or exceeds expectations. However, the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve can introduce uncertainty and potentially lead to a decrease in stock prices if the decision is not in favor of the company or the overall market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. The market typically reacts negatively to such analyst downgrades.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The underperform rating from Jefferies, a reputable firm, carries significant weight and is a strong bearish signal, especially given the rarity of such ratings for Apple.  Concerns about weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the underwhelming reception of AI features further support a pessimistic outlook. The projected revenue miss and potential Q1 disappointment add to the negative sentiment.  However, Apple's strong services business and high margins offer a degree of resilience.  The services sector's growth could partially offset weakness in hardware sales.  The valuation concerns, highlighted by the analyst's $200.75 price target and the significant multiple expansion in recent years, also suggest a potential for correction.  While the Alphabet antitrust case is a long-term risk, its immediate impact is uncertain. Considering the confluence of negative factors and the weight of the Jefferies downgrade, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.  However, Apple's overall strength and the potential for the market to react less severely than expected should be considered. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.
