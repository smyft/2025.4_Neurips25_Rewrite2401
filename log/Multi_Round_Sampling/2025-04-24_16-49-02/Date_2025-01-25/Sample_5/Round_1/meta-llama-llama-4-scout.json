(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms and highlights Apple's inclusion in the emerging BATMMAAN group, which suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple as part of a strong cohort of tech stocks. The historical performance of these groupings has generally been favorable, which could lead to increased investor confidence in AAPL. However, the overall market conditions and upcoming earnings reports could also influence stock movements. Given the context, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the evolution of mega-cap stock groupings and Apple's continued presence in these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN). This suggests Apple remains a dominant and influential player in the tech market. While the article doesn't directly discuss Apple's financial performance or specific product releases, the consistent inclusion in these elite groups implies sustained market relevance and investor confidence. The comparison of returns across different groupings could indirectly influence investor sentiment, but the primary takeaway is Apple's enduring position. Therefore, the news is slightly positive, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall. However, the effect is likely to be small, as the news is more about market categorization than Apple-specific performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a rare underperform rating from Jefferies and concerns about weak iPhone shipments and AI feature adoption are bearish factors,  Apple's strong services revenue growth and high margins offer a counterpoint.  The analyst's price target of $200.75 is below the current price (this would need to be determined from external data to give a precise analysis), suggesting a potential downside. However, the article also highlights Apple's robust business model and the potential for long-term growth in its services sector. The uncertainty surrounding the Alphabet antitrust case adds further complexity. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's overall strength and the potential for the market to disregard a single analyst's opinion, especially given the bullish nature of the overall market sentiment towards Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by 20% based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current share price of $223. The DCF model, while not without flaws, is a widely respected valuation method. The article also notes that the fair value estimate is 13% higher than the analyst price target of $246, indicating potential upside. Given the positive valuation gap and the general market tendency to correct undervaluation over time, there is a reasonable probability that the stock price could rise. However, the DCF model's assumptions (e.g., growth rates, discount rate) are critical and could be challenged, which introduces some uncertainty. The article also highlights risks such as slower earnings growth and low dividends, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the undervaluation signal is strong, but market reactions can be influenced by broader factors not accounted for in the DCF.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Some bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut for Apple, while bulls believe the sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Given the current downbeat sentiment and stable estimates for the December quarter, there is a potential for the stock price to rise if Apple's earnings report meets or exceeds expectations, and for it to fall if the report is disappointing or if a guidance cut is announced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact stock prices. The report will likely include information about the company's performance in the artificial intelligence sector, which is a central theme in the Big Tech earnings reports. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday can also influence the stock market. Historically, the release of quarterly earnings reports can lead to stock price volatility. Given that Apple is a well-established company with a strong track record, the release of its earnings report may lead to a positive reaction from investors, especially if the report meets or exceeds expectations. However, the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve can introduce uncertainty and potentially lead to a decrease in stock prices if the decision is not in favor of the company or the overall market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. The market typically reacts negatively to such analyst downgrades.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
