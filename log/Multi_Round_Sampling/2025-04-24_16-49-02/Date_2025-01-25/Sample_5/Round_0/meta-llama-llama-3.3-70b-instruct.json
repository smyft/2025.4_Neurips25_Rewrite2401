(AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact stock prices. The report will likely include information about the company's performance in the artificial intelligence sector, which is a central theme in the Big Tech earnings reports. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday can also influence the stock market. Historically, the release of quarterly earnings reports can lead to stock price volatility. Given that Apple is a well-established company with a strong track record, the release of its earnings report may lead to a positive reaction from investors, especially if the report meets or exceeds expectations. However, the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve can introduce uncertainty and potentially lead to a decrease in stock prices if the decision is not in favor of the company or the overall market.\", \n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\", \n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\", \n\"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\", \n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6, \n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}"
