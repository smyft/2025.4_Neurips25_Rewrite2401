(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms and highlights Apple's inclusion in the emerging BATMMAAN group, which suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple as part of a strong cohort of tech stocks. The historical performance of these groupings has generally been favorable, which could lead to increased investor confidence in AAPL. However, the overall market conditions and upcoming earnings reports could also influence stock movements. Given the context, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the evolution of mega-cap stock groupings and Apple's continued presence in these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN). This suggests Apple remains a dominant and influential player in the tech market. While the article doesn't directly discuss Apple's financial performance or specific product releases, the consistent inclusion in these elite groups implies sustained market relevance and investor confidence. The comparison of returns across different groupings could indirectly influence investor sentiment, but the primary takeaway is Apple's enduring position. Therefore, the news is slightly positive, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall. However, the effect is likely to be small, as the news is more about market categorization than Apple-specific performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a rare underperform rating from Jefferies and concerns about weak iPhone shipments and AI feature adoption are bearish factors,  Apple's strong services revenue growth and high margins offer a counterpoint.  The analyst's price target of $200.75 is below the current price (this would need to be determined from external data to give a precise analysis), suggesting a potential downside. However, the article also highlights Apple's robust business model and the potential for long-term growth in its services sector. The uncertainty surrounding the Alphabet antitrust case adds further complexity. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's overall strength and the potential for the market to disregard a single analyst's opinion, especially given the bullish nature of the overall market sentiment towards Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by 20% based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current share price of $223. The DCF model, while not without flaws, is a widely respected valuation method. The article also notes that the fair value estimate is 13% higher than the analyst price target of $246, indicating potential upside. Given the positive valuation gap and the general market tendency to correct undervaluation over time, there is a reasonable probability that the stock price could rise. However, the DCF model's assumptions (e.g., growth rates, discount rate) are critical and could be challenged, which introduces some uncertainty. The article also highlights risks such as slower earnings growth and low dividends, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the undervaluation signal is strong, but market reactions can be influenced by broader factors not accounted for in the DCF.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Some bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut for Apple, while bulls believe the sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Given the current downbeat sentiment and stable estimates for the December quarter, there is a potential for the stock price to rise if Apple's earnings report meets or exceeds expectations, and for it to fall if the report is disappointing or if a guidance cut is announced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact stock prices. The report will likely include information about the company's performance in the artificial intelligence sector, which is a central theme in the Big Tech earnings reports. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday can also influence the stock market. Historically, the release of quarterly earnings reports can lead to stock price volatility. Given that Apple is a well-established company with a strong track record, the release of its earnings report may lead to a positive reaction from investors, especially if the report meets or exceeds expectations. However, the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve can introduce uncertainty and potentially lead to a decrease in stock prices if the decision is not in favor of the company or the overall market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. The market typically reacts negatively to such analyst downgrades.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued presence in influential mega-cap stock groupings, which generally suggests positive sentiment and investor confidence. However, there are mixed signals from previous predictions, with some analysts expressing concerns about iPhone shipments and potential revenue misses. The overall market sentiment towards Apple remains strong, especially with its inclusion in the emerging BATMMAAN group, which could bolster investor confidence. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but acknowledge the risks that could lead to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the evolution of mega-cap stock groupings and Apple's consistent inclusion in these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN).

The underperform rating from Jefferies, a reputable firm, carries significant weight and is a strong bearish signal, especially given the rarity of such ratings for Apple.  Concerns about weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the underwhelming reception of AI features further support a pessimistic outlook. The projected revenue miss and potential Q1 disappointment add to the negative sentiment.  However, Apple's strong services business and high margins offer a degree of resilience.  The services sector's growth could partially offset weakness in hardware sales.  The valuation concerns, highlighted by the analyst's $200.75 price target and the significant multiple expansion in recent years, also suggest a potential for correction.  While the Alphabet antitrust case is a long-term risk, its immediate impact is uncertain. Considering the confluence of negative factors and the weight of the Jefferies downgrade, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.  However, Apple's overall strength and the potential for the market to react less severely than expected should be considered. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  My prediction leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, but acknowledges the possibility of a less dramatic reaction than the news might suggest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc.

However, previous rounds show mixed sentiment, with some models highlighting concerns about iPhone shipments and AI adoption, while others emphasize Apple's undervaluation. The 'underperform' rating from Jefferies is a significant bearish signal that cannot be ignored. Considering the positive aspect of being in BATMMAAN and the negative signals from the analyst downgrade and potential revenue misses, I'm leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, but the negative signals temper my optimism. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight decrease in the probability of a rise, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The rare underperform rating from Jefferies is a significant bearish signal, especially given Jefferies' price target of $200.75, which is substantially below the current market price (assuming a price above $200.75). Concerns about weak iPhone shipments, particularly in China, and the underwhelming reception of AI features further support a pessimistic outlook.  The projected revenue miss and potential Q1 disappointment add to the negative sentiment. However, Apple's strong services business and high margins offer a degree of resilience.

While the negative factors are substantial, Apple's overall strength and the potential for the market to react less severely than expected should be considered.  The fact that this is a *rare* underperform rating suggests that the market may not react as strongly as it would to a more common downgrade.  Considering the weight of the negative factors, but acknowledging Apple's resilience, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, but not an overwhelmingly high one.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a detailed Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggesting that Apple Inc.
