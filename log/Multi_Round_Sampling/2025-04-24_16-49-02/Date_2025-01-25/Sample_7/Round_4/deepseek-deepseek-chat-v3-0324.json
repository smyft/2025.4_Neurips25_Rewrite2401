      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant dividend income from various stocks, including Apple. While Buffett's reduced stake in Apple may suggest a lack of confidence, the overall context of strong dividend income and the potential for Apple to increase its dividend could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the mention of Buffett's decreasing position may also raise concerns among investors. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of potential positive and negative impacts on Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily discuss the evolution of mega-cap stock groupings and Apple's continued presence in these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN). While the article doesn't directly address Apple's financial performance or specific product announcements, its inclusion in the 'BATMMAAN' group suggests continued market relevance and strength. This positive association, although indirect, could slightly boost investor confidence. However, the article also focuses on broader market trends and comparisons between different groups, which dilutes the direct impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, the impact is likely to be slightly positive, but not significantly so. The related videos don't seem to have any direct impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, where AI will be a key focus.  Strong AI-related announcements could boost the stock price, while disappointing results could lead to a decline. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is also a significant factor. A rate hike could negatively impact the overall market and Apple's stock price, while a pause or smaller increase might be viewed more favorably.  The overall impact is uncertain, with both positive and negative factors at play.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned reflecting this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise given Apple's generally strong performance and the potential for positive AI news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several key points about Apple Inc. (AAPL): 1) The stock has underperformed recently, losing about 15% of its value since its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. 2) Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025 have been declining. 3) However, Apple bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner soon, which could mitigate some concerns. 4) Apple's margins are expected to be modestly up year-over-year, which is a positive sign. Given the mixed signals\u2014negative sentiment and declining estimates vs. potential positive developments in AI and stable margins\u2014the stock price movement is uncertain but leans slightly negative in the short term due to the prevailing bearish sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential as a bear market stock, highlighting its robust financial health, consistent record of returning value to shareholders, and the introduction of new features such as health-monitoring tools. Despite concerns about a potential bear market in 2025 from various economists, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified product ecosystem position it well. However, the overall cautious sentiment and predictions of a possible downturn could temper investor enthusiasm. The article's positive tone on Apple's resilience and growth potential suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, but the external economic concerns introduce uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the profitability of streaming services, particularly Netflix, and the challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent profits. While the article highlights the progress made by these companies, it also notes the concerns about retaining customer base, combating increased churn, and the limitations of raising prices. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as a major player in the streaming wars, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, as a major player in the technology and entertainment industry, any positive developments in the streaming sector could have a slight positive effect on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals regarding the economic environment and market sentiment. On one hand, there's cautious optimism about the economy and strong consumer spending, which supports the stock price. On the other hand, there are concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential market peaks indicated by foreign investment trends. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is highlighted as a resilient stock with robust financial health and growing demand for its products. However, it is also noted that some analysts believe in higher returns from other stocks. Given the balanced outlook provided by the news, the probability of stock price movement remains relatively moderate.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant dividend income from various stocks, including Apple. While Buffett's reduced stake in Apple may suggest a lack of confidence, the overall context of strong dividend income and the potential for Apple to increase its dividend could positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns about Apple's recent performance and external economic factors introduce uncertainty. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, reflecting the positive aspects of dividend income and Apple's strong fundamentals, but tempered by the caution surrounding Buffett's reduced stake.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, with Apple consistently being a part of these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN). This suggests Apple's continued market relevance and strength. While the article doesn't delve into Apple's specific financials, its inclusion in the 'BATMMAAN' group implies a positive sentiment. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight positive bias in most predictions, although some models have leaned towards a negative outlook due to concerns about AI strategy and market conditions. Given Apple's consistent presence in these elite groups and the general positive sentiment, I'll slightly increase the probability of a price rise compared to the previous rounds' average.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.  While the news is broadly market-focused, Apple's inclusion in the earnings announcements is significant.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning slightly positive and others slightly negative.  The uncertainty surrounding the Fed's decision and the potential impact on the overall market adds to the volatility.  The AI focus in the earnings reports presents both opportunity and risk; strong AI-related announcements could boost the stock, while disappointing results could hurt it. Considering the mixed signals and the overall market uncertainty, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, slightly favoring a price rise due to Apple's generally strong performance and the potential for positive AI news, but acknowledging the significant downside risk from the Fed's decision and the overall market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of upcoming Q4 earnings, highlighting several key factors: 1) AAPL shares have recently underperformed, losing about 15% of their value due to worries about China and its AI strategy. 2) Bearish analysts are projecting a potential guidance cut, with declining EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025. 3) Apple's net margins are expected to be modestly up year-over-year, which is a positive sign. 4) There is bullish sentiment from some investors who believe the negative outlook is overdone and expect positive AI developments. Given these mixed signals\u2014negative sentiment and declining estimates vs. potential positive AI announcements and stable margins\u2014the stock price movement is uncertain but leans slightly negative in the near term due to the prevailing bearish sentiment and market concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential as a bear market stock, highlighting its robust financial health, consistent record of returning value to shareholders, and the introduction of new features such as health-monitoring tools. Despite concerns about a potential bear market in 2025 from various economists, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified product ecosystem position it well.

While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as a major player in the streaming wars, the company's involvement in the streaming industry through its Apple TV+ service could be indirectly affected by the trends and challenges discussed. The article highlights the progress made by streaming companies in achieving profitability, but also notes concerns about retaining customer base, combating increased churn, and the limitations of raising prices. Given that Apple is a major player in the technology and entertainment industry, any positive developments in the streaming sector could have a slight positive effect on AAPL's stock price. However, the lack of direct mention and the mixed outlook for the streaming industry suggest that the impact on AAPL's stock price will be minimal. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions on the stock's movement, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced view, leaning slightly towards a neutral stance due to the indirect relevance of the news to Apple's stock.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting Apple Inc., including economic forecasts, market sentiments, and the company's own financial health and product offerings. The news indicates a cautious optimism with mixed signals about potential economic downturns, but also highlights Apple's robust financial health, consistent shareholder value return, and recent product innovations like health-monitoring tools. Previous predictions show a balance between positive and negative factors, leaning towards a slight positive sentiment but also acknowledging uncertainties and competing investments. Given the current context, the stock price movement probabilities seem moderately balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant dividend income from various stocks, including Apple, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns about Buffett's reduced stake in Apple and the overall market conditions introduce uncertainty. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong fundamentals and market relevance, while others reflect bearish sentiment due to recent underperformance and external economic factors. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a price rise, reflecting the positive aspects of dividend income and Apple's strong position in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news focuses on the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms and Apple's consistent presence in these groups (FAANG, Magnificent Seven, BATMMAAN). This suggests Apple's continued market relevance and strength. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight positive bias in most predictions, although some models have leaned towards a negative outlook due to concerns about AI strategy and market conditions. Given Apple's consistent presence in these elite groups and the general positive sentiment, I'll slightly increase the probability of a price rise compared to the previous rounds' average. Also, the fact that Apple is consistently mentioned in these groups suggests a strong market position, which is generally viewed positively by investors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news piece is broadly focused on upcoming Big Tech earnings and the Fed's interest rate decision, making it difficult to isolate the impact specifically on Apple.  While Apple's inclusion in the earnings announcements is significant, the overall market sentiment and the Fed's decision will likely have a larger influence. The previous predictions are quite varied, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise.  The uncertainty surrounding the Fed's decision and the potential impact on the overall market adds to the volatility.  The AI focus in the earnings reports presents both opportunity and risk.  Considering the mixed signals and the overall market uncertainty, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook.  The slight upward trend in predictions across rounds suggests a slightly positive bias, but the inherent uncertainty remains high.  I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly upward from a completely neutral position to reflect this subtle positive bias, but maintaining a significant degree of uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming Q4 earnings report amid concerns about China and its AI strategy, with the stock having lost 15% of its value since its 52-week high.

The news provides both positive and negative signals. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a stock with robust financial health, consistent shareholder value return, and innovative product features like health-monitoring tools. However, there are concerns about potential economic downturns, inflation, and foreign investment patterns that could impact the broader market and, consequently, Apple's stock. The mixed signals provided by previous rounds of predictions indicate a balanced outlook, with slight variations in sentiment but no strong consensus. Overall, the probabilities are evenly split considering these factors.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant dividend income from various stocks, including Apple, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns about Buffett's reduced stake in Apple and the overall market conditions introduce uncertainty. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive due to Apple's strong fundamentals and market relevance, while others reflect bearish sentiment due to recent underperformance and external economic factors. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a price rise, reflecting the positive aspects of dividend income and Apple's strong position in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news focuses on the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, with Apple consistently being a part of these groups. This suggests continued market relevance and strength. While the article doesn't delve into Apple's specific financials, its inclusion in the 'BATMMAAN' group implies a positive sentiment. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight positive bias in most predictions, although some models have leaned towards a negative outlook due to concerns about AI strategy and market conditions. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising. Therefore, I will increase the probability of a price rise compared to the previous rounds' average, but not too much, as there are still some concerns about AI strategy and market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news piece is largely macroeconomic, focusing on broad market trends (Big Tech earnings and the Fed's interest rate decision).  While Apple is mentioned as a key player in the upcoming earnings announcements, the impact of the news on AAPL specifically is indirect and uncertain.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with probabilities of a price rise oscillating around 0.5, indicating significant uncertainty.  The consistent presence of Apple in various mega-cap stock acronyms suggests continued market strength, but this is not a strong indicator of short-term price movement.  Concerns about the Fed's rate decision and potential economic slowdown are significant factors that could negatively impact Apple's stock price, regardless of its earnings report.  Considering the mixed signals and the overall market uncertainty, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, slightly favoring a price rise due to Apple's generally strong performance and the potential for positive AI news, but acknowledging the significant downside risk from the Fed's decision and the overall market sentiment.  The slight upward trend in predictions across rounds is considered, but the inherent uncertainty remains high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s upcoming Q4 earnings report amid concerns about China and its AI strategy, with the stock having lost 15% of its value since its 52-week high. Bearish analysts project a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025 have been declining. However, Apple bulls argue the negative sentiment is overdone and expect positive AI developments, which could mitigate concerns. Given the mixed signals\u2014negative sentiment and declining estimates vs. potential positive AI announcements\u2014the stock price movement is uncertain but leans slightly negative in the near term due to prevailing bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a balanced view, with some leaning slightly positive and others slightly negative. Considering all these factors, the probabilities are assigned to reflect a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential as a bear market stock, highlighting its robust financial health, consistent record of returning value to shareholders, and the introduction of new features such as health-monitoring tools. Despite concerns about a potential bear market in 2025 from various economists, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified product ecosystem position it well. However, the overall cautious sentiment and predictions of a possible downturn could temper investor enthusiasm. The article's positive tone on Apple's resilience and growth potential suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, but the external economic concerns introduce uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and previous predictions from other models, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced view, leaning slightly towards a positive outlook due to Apple's strong performance and potential for positive AI-related announcements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the profitability of streaming services, particularly Netflix, and the challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent profits. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as a major player in the streaming wars, the company's involvement in the streaming industry through its Apple TV+ service could be indirectly affected by the trends and challenges discussed. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions on the stock's movement, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced view. Since the news does not directly impact Apple's stock price but indicates a positive trend in the streaming industry, which Apple is a part of, the probabilities lean slightly towards a neutral stance with a minor positive bias due to the indirect relevance of the news to Apple's stock.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting Apple Inc., including economic forecasts, cautious optimism about the economy, and the company's own financial health and product offerings. The news provides both positive and negative signals. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a stock with robust financial health, consistent shareholder value return, and innovative product features like health-monitoring tools. However, there are concerns about potential economic downturns, inflation, and foreign investment patterns that could impact the broader market and, consequently, Apple's stock. The mixed signals provided by previous rounds of predictions indicate a balanced outlook, with slight variations in sentiment but no strong consensus.
