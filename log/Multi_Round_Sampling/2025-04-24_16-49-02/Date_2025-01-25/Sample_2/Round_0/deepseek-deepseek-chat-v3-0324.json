This could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance or a strategic shift towards higher-growth opportunities. Such actions by a high-profile investor might lead to negative sentiment among other investors, potentially causing a short-term decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple is a large, well-established company with strong fundamentals, so the impact might be limited. The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the negative signal, but the probability of a rise is not zero as the market might not react strongly to a single investor's move.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
