      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's market position, particularly in China, and potential revenue losses from legal challenges. Additionally, the lack of a strong iPhone upgrade cycle and high valuation metrics suggest bearish sentiment. Steven Cohen's decision to sell his entire stake in Apple, a move that indicates a lack of confidence in the stock, further supports the likelihood of a price decline. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news piece highlights two major factors influencing Apple's stock price: upcoming earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to focus on AI, which could be a positive catalyst if Apple demonstrates strong AI initiatives. However, the overall market sentiment towards tech earnings will play a significant role. The Fed's interest rate decision is a broader macroeconomic factor. A dovish stance (rate cuts or signals of future cuts) is generally positive for stocks, while a hawkish stance (rate hikes or signals of future hikes) is generally negative. Without specific details on Apple's expected earnings or the anticipated Fed decision, it's difficult to give a precise probability. I'm assuming a slightly positive outlook due to the potential for positive AI news and the market's general anticipation of a less hawkish Fed. However, earnings are always a risk, and a negative surprise could easily send the stock down.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock.  While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the market.  The mention of Cohen buying another AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly influence Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares, but the overall effect is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI stock that has seen significant growth. This could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance or a strategic shift towards higher-growth opportunities. Such actions by a high-profile investor might lead to negative sentiment among other investors, potentially causing a short-term decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple is a large, well-established company with strong fundamentals, so the impact might be limited. The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the negative signal, but the probability of a rise is not zero as the market might not react strongly to a single investor's move.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could impact its stock price. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low, but given the neutral nature of the news, it leans slightly towards a neutral impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his entire stake in Apple and invested in Axon Enterprise, a company that has seen significant growth in the last 30 months. The article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue, and high valuation. In contrast, Axon Enterprise has a strong growth trajectory, a leadership position in its market, and a long runway for growth. However, its valuation is also considered expensive. Based on this information, it appears that the news is bearish for Apple and bullish for Axon Enterprise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the tech giants whose quarterly results are coming up next week, along with other significant industry players like Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META). The earnings reports are expected to revolve around artificial intelligence, which could positively impact investor sentiment if the company shows strong performance in this area. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision might influence overall market sentiment, but it's uncertain how specific it will affect AAPL. Therefore, while there is potential for positive news from earnings, the broader market may react to the Fed's decision.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's market position, particularly in China, and potential revenue losses from legal challenges. Steven Cohen's decision to sell his entire stake in Apple suggests a lack of confidence in the stock, which could lead to negative sentiment among investors. Additionally, the absence of a strong iPhone upgrade cycle and high valuation metrics further support a bearish outlook. While there is some potential for positive news from upcoming earnings, the overall sentiment appears to lean towards a decline in stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, and the Fed's interest rate decision. The emphasis on AI in earnings reports could be a positive catalyst for Apple if they demonstrate strong AI initiatives. However, the Fed's decision introduces uncertainty, as a hawkish stance could negatively impact the market. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, banking on positive AI news and a potentially less hawkish Fed. The previous round predictions are mixed, with some leaning bearish due to concerns about market position and investor actions, while others are more optimistic about AI and the Fed. Given this, I'm adjusting my prediction to be slightly more bullish than the average of the previous predictions, but still acknowledging the risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen sold his Apple stock is the primary driver of the analysis.  While this is noteworthy, it's crucial to consider that Cohen's reasons are unknown.  It could be portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a genuine shift in outlook.  The lack of specifics makes it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  Some models emphasize the potential for positive AI news in upcoming earnings, while others focus on the negative sentiment associated with Cohen's sale.  Considering the lack of concrete information beyond Cohen's sale and the divergence in previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The slight lean towards a fall reflects the negative sentiment associated with a high-profile investor selling, but this is tempered by the lack of clear reasons and the potential for positive news from upcoming earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a lesser-known AI stock, which has seen significant growth. This action by a high-profile investor could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance, potentially leading to negative sentiment among other investors. However, Apple is a large, well-established company with strong fundamentals, which might mitigate the impact of this news. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall due to the negative signal from Cohen's sale, while others consider the broader market context, such as upcoming earnings and Federal Reserve decisions, which could have a neutral or slightly positive impact. Given the mixed signals and the fact that Apple's stock is influenced by multiple factors beyond a single investor's move, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any company-specific information that could impact its stock price. The news discusses investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market index fund. Without specific information about Apple's performance, products, or market position, it's challenging to assess a direct impact on its stock price. However, given that the overall market sentiment and tech sector performance can influence Apple's stock, and considering that the previous rounds' predictions indicate a cautious outlook due to various factors such as potential legal challenges, iPhone sales decline in China, and high valuation metrics, it's reasonable to assume a neutral to slightly bearish outlook. The lack of direct company-specific information and the general nature of the news suggest that the stock price movement probabilities should be relatively balanced but with a slight inclination towards a cautious view due to the overall market conditions and previous predictions that suggest concerns about Apple's market position and revenue.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue, and high valuation. Additionally, billionaire Steven Cohen's decision to sell his entire stake in Apple and invest in Axon Enterprise, a company with a strong growth trajectory, may be perceived as a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. Considering these factors and the predictions from other models, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple factors affecting Apple Inc.'s stock price, including Big Tech earnings reports and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The earnings reports, especially those focusing on AI, could positively impact Apple's stock price if the company demonstrates strong AI initiatives. However, the Federal Reserve's decision introduces uncertainty as a hawkish stance could negatively impact the stock price. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments ranging from bearish to slightly bullish. Considering the potential for positive AI news and the market's general anticipation of a less hawkish Fed, the likelihood of a price rise remains moderate.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
