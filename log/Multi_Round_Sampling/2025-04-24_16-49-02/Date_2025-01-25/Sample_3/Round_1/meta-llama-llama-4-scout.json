(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\nNews Content: Market Domination Overtime hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton detail the top market events on the horizon for the upcoming week.\n\nA slew of Big Tech earnings is scheduled for release, with industry giants Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL) preparing to unveil their quarterly results.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). As such, this news does not provide any specific information or insights that would likely influence AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in AAPL's stock price are low, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple is likely to increase its dividend. This news is generally neutral to slightly positive for Apple. It reinforces the company's financial stability and dividend-paying capacity. However, the article also mentions Buffett *could* sell more of the stock, which introduces some uncertainty. The overall impact is likely to be small, as the dividend income is a relatively small portion of Apple's overall revenue and market capitalization. The mention of potential further selling by Buffett tempers any positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock.  While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the stock price.  The mention of Cohen buying another AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly influence Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools are highlighted. The company's resilience in bear markets and its inclusion in the list of best bear market stocks suggest defensive appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the tech sector could negatively impact AAPL's stock price. The article also mentions historical patterns where surges in foreign investment preceded market downturns, adding to the uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to Apple's strong fundamentals and defensive attributes, but the probability of a fall is also significant due to macroeconomic risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the Big Tech companies preparing to unveil their quarterly results, along with the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The earnings report from Apple could potentially have a significant impact on its stock price. If Apple's earnings report is better than expected, it could lead to a rise in the stock price. However, if the report is worse than expected or the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is hawkish, it could lead to a fall in the stock price. Given the uncertainty of the earnings report and the interest rate decision, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.55 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Instead, it discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad-based index fund that tracks the overall US stock market. Since the news does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight bias towards no change, but since the market can be unpredictable and the news might have an indirect effect by influencing overall market sentiment, a small probability is assigned to both rise and fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that a well-regarded investor, Steven Cohen, has sold his entire stake in Apple, suggesting a lack of confidence in the company's future performance. This could be interpreted negatively by other investors, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including loss of market share in China and potential revenue losses from the Safari search deal. On the other hand, Axon Enterprise is presented positively, showing strong growth and increasing demand for its AI-integrated products. However, the high valuation multiples for Axon may concern some investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
