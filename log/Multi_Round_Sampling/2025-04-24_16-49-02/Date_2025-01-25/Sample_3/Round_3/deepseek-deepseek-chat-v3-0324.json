(AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

(AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company emerges as a prime investment opportunity for several reasons. First and foremost, the company\u2019s robust financial health is depicted in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue was $94.9 billion, increasing 6% year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share was $0.97. This shows the increasing demand for the company\u2019s products or services and its ability to generate earnings for shareholders. Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2024, the company declared quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, totaling $0.96 per share annually. Secondly, the company has also introduced a general health-monitoring tool in all its new devices. For instance, an Apple Watch can monitor heart rate, check for atrial fibrillation, detect falls and car crashes, monitor blood-oxygen levels, and track body temperature for fertility planning.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). As such, this news does not provide any specific information or insights that would likely influence AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in AAPL's stock price are low, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple is likely to increase its dividend. This news is generally neutral to slightly positive for Apple. It reinforces the company's financial stability and dividend-paying capacity. However, the article also mentions Buffett *could* sell more of the stock, which introduces some uncertainty. The overall impact is likely to be small, as the dividend income is a relatively small portion of Apple's overall revenue and market capitalization. The mention of potential further selling by Buffett tempers any positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock.  While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the stock price.  The mention of Cohen buying another AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly influence Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools are highlighted. The company's resilience in bear markets and its inclusion in the list of best bear market stocks suggest defensive appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the tech sector could negatively impact AAPL's stock price. The article also mentions historical patterns where surges in foreign investment preceded market downturns, adding to the uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to Apple's strong fundamentals and defensive attributes, but the probability of a fall is also significant due to macroeconomic risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the Big Tech companies preparing to unveil their quarterly results, along with the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The earnings report from Apple could potentially have a significant impact on its stock price. If Apple's earnings report is better than expected, it could lead to a rise in the stock price. However, if the report is worse than expected or the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is hawkish, it could lead to a fall in the stock price. Given the uncertainty of the earnings report and the interest rate decision, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.55 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Instead, it discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad-based index fund that tracks the overall US stock market. Since the news does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight bias towards no change, but since the market can be unpredictable and the news might have an indirect effect by influencing overall market sentiment, a small probability is assigned to both rise and fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that a well-regarded investor, Steven Cohen, has sold his entire stake in Apple, suggesting a lack of confidence in the company's future performance. This could be interpreted negatively by other investors, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including loss of market share in China and potential revenue losses from the Safari search deal. On the other hand, Axon Enterprise is presented positively, showing strong growth and increasing demand for its AI-integrated products. However, the high valuation multiples for Axon may concern some investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). This lack of direct relevance suggests that the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on AAPL's stock price. Previous predictions indicate a range of sentiments, with some suggesting slight positive or negative influences based on broader market conditions or investor actions. However, given the neutral nature of the news and its indirect implications, I estimate the probabilities of stock price movement to be relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025).

The overall impact is likely to be small, as the dividend income is a relatively small portion of Apple's overall revenue and market capitalization. The mention of potential further selling by Buffett tempers any positive sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most lean towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook. I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock is the most significant piece of information. While individual investor actions don't always dictate market movement, Cohen's sale introduces negative sentiment.  The lack of detail regarding the sale volume makes it difficult to quantify the impact.  However, the previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price fall than others. Considering the overall uncertainty and the negative sentiment introduced by Cohen's sale, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise.  The mention of Cohen investing in an AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions provide a useful context, showing a range of opinions and highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news's impact.  I'm weighting my prediction towards the more conservative estimates that account for the negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools are highlighted.

The article also mentions historical patterns where surges in foreign investment preceded market downturns, adding to the uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to Apple's strong fundamentals and defensive attributes, but the probability of a fall is also significant due to macroeconomic risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Big Tech earnings releases, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's upcoming earnings report could have a significant impact on its stock price. If the earnings report is better than expected, it could lead to a rise in the stock price. However, if the report is worse than expected or the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is hawkish, it could lead to a fall in the stock price. Given the uncertainty of the earnings report and the interest rate decision, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.52 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.48. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with some indicating a slightly higher chance of a price rise and others a slightly higher chance of a price fall. The overall sentiment seems to be cautiously optimistic, with a slight bias towards a potential rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals and the potential for a positive earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the lack of specific information about Apple in the news, it is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on the company's stock price. However, considering the predictions from other models, there seems to be a mixed outlook for Apple, with some models indicating a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the company's strong fundamentals and defensive attributes, while others suggest a higher probability of a fall due to macroeconomic risks and negative sentiment from prominent investors. Since the news itself does not provide any specific insights into Apple's performance, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight bias towards stability.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Steven Cohen, a highly regarded investor, has sold his entire stake in Apple. This action suggests a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance, which could negatively influence other investors' perceptions. Additional challenges faced by Apple, such as losing market share in China and potential revenue losses from the Safari search deal, further compound the negative sentiment. On the other hand, Axon Enterprise is presented positively, showing strong growth, but its high valuation multiples may raise concerns for some investors. Given the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's recent performance and strategic challenges, the probability of a stock price fall is estimated to be higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not directly relate to Apple Inc.

Therefore, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news that Steven Cohen sold his Apple stock is the most impactful piece of information. While a single investor's action doesn't guarantee market movement, Cohen's sale introduces negative sentiment.  The lack of detail on the sale volume makes quantifying the impact difficult.  However, the consistent negative prediction from qwen/qwen-turbo across rounds, coupled with the generally cautious to slightly negative sentiment from other models in round 1, suggests a higher probability of a price fall.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the weight of evidence leans towards a more conservative outlook.  The news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the stock price.  The mention of Cohen investing in another AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price.  Therefore, while the impact is likely to be small, the negative sentiment from a prominent investor selling outweighs any other factors in this specific news item.  I'm weighting my prediction towards the more conservative estimates that account for the negative sentiment, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock price movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
