      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). As such, this news does not provide any specific information or insights that would likely influence AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in AAPL's stock price are low, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple is likely to increase its dividend. This news is generally neutral to slightly positive for Apple. It reinforces the company's financial stability and dividend-paying capacity. However, the article also mentions Buffett *could* sell more of the stock, which introduces some uncertainty. The overall impact is likely to be small, as the dividend income is a relatively small portion of Apple's overall revenue and market capitalization. The mention of potential further selling by Buffett tempers any positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock.  While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the stock price.  The mention of Cohen buying another AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly influence Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools are highlighted. The company's resilience in bear markets and its inclusion in the list of best bear market stocks suggest defensive appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the tech sector could negatively impact AAPL's stock price. The article also mentions historical patterns where surges in foreign investment preceded market downturns, adding to the uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to Apple's strong fundamentals and defensive attributes, but the probability of a fall is also significant due to macroeconomic risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the Big Tech companies preparing to unveil their quarterly results, along with the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The earnings report from Apple could potentially have a significant impact on its stock price. If Apple's earnings report is better than expected, it could lead to a rise in the stock price. However, if the report is worse than expected or the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is hawkish, it could lead to a fall in the stock price. Given the uncertainty of the earnings report and the interest rate decision, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.55 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. Instead, it discusses how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad-based index fund that tracks the overall US stock market. Since the news does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight bias towards no change, but since the market can be unpredictable and the news might have an indirect effect by influencing overall market sentiment, a small probability is assigned to both rise and fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that a well-regarded investor, Steven Cohen, has sold his entire stake in Apple, suggesting a lack of confidence in the company's future performance. This could be interpreted negatively by other investors, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including loss of market share in China and potential revenue losses from the Safari search deal. On the other hand, Axon Enterprise is presented positively, showing strong growth and increasing demand for its AI-integrated products. However, the high valuation multiples for Axon may concern some investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). This lack of direct relevance suggests that the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on AAPL's stock price. Previous predictions indicate a range of sentiments, with some suggesting slight positive or negative influences based on broader market conditions or investor actions. However, given the neutral nature of the news and its indirect implications, I estimate the probabilities of stock price movement to be relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025).

The overall impact is likely to be small, as the dividend income is a relatively small portion of Apple's overall revenue and market capitalization. The mention of potential further selling by Buffett tempers any positive sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most lean towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook. I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock is the most significant piece of information. While individual investor actions don't always dictate market movement, Cohen's sale introduces negative sentiment.  The lack of detail regarding the sale volume makes it difficult to quantify the impact.  However, the previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price fall than others. Considering the overall uncertainty and the negative sentiment introduced by Cohen's sale, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise.  The mention of Cohen investing in an AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions provide a useful context, showing a range of opinions and highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news's impact.  I'm weighting my prediction towards the more conservative estimates that account for the negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools are highlighted.

The article also mentions historical patterns where surges in foreign investment preceded market downturns, adding to the uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to Apple's strong fundamentals and defensive attributes, but the probability of a fall is also significant due to macroeconomic risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Big Tech earnings releases, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's upcoming earnings report could have a significant impact on its stock price. If the earnings report is better than expected, it could lead to a rise in the stock price. However, if the report is worse than expected or the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is hawkish, it could lead to a fall in the stock price. Given the uncertainty of the earnings report and the interest rate decision, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.52 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.48. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with some indicating a slightly higher chance of a price rise and others a slightly higher chance of a price fall. The overall sentiment seems to be cautiously optimistic, with a slight bias towards a potential rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals and the potential for a positive earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not directly relate to Apple Inc.

However, considering the predictions from other models, there seems to be a mixed outlook for Apple, with some models indicating a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the company's strong fundamentals and defensive attributes, while others suggest a higher probability of a fall due to macroeconomic risks and negative sentiment from prominent investors. Since the news itself does not provide any specific insights into Apple's performance, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight bias towards stability.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Steven Cohen, a highly regarded investor, has sold his entire stake in Apple. This action suggests a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance, which could negatively influence other investors' perceptions. Additional challenges faced by Apple, such as losing market share in China and potential revenue losses from the Safari search deal, further compound the negative sentiment. On the other hand, Axon Enterprise is presented positively, showing strong growth, but its high valuation multiples may raise concerns for some investors. Given the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's recent performance and strategic challenges, the probability of a stock price fall is estimated to be higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not directly relate to Apple Inc.

Therefore, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news that Steven Cohen sold his Apple stock is the most impactful piece of information. While a single investor's action doesn't guarantee market movement, Cohen's sale introduces negative sentiment.  The lack of detail on the sale volume makes quantifying the impact difficult.  However, the consistent negative prediction from qwen/qwen-turbo across rounds, coupled with the generally cautious to slightly negative sentiment from other models in round 1, suggests a higher probability of a price fall.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the weight of evidence leans towards a more conservative outlook.  The news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the stock price.  The mention of Cohen investing in another AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price.  Therefore, while the impact is likely to be small, the negative sentiment from a prominent investor selling outweighs any other factors in this specific news item.  I'm weighting my prediction towards the more conservative estimates that account for the negative sentiment, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock price movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
