      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current price of $223. This suggests a potential for price appreciation as investors may view the stock as a buying opportunity. Additionally, the forecasted growth in annual earnings over the next three years supports a positive outlook. However, there are also risks mentioned, such as declining earnings over the past year and slower growth compared to the broader market, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the undervaluation and growth potential lead to a higher probability of a price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest potential regulatory scrutiny for Apple due to concerns about its market power and the rise of eSIMs. While the article doesn't indicate immediate action, the fact that BT and Virgin Media O2 are raising concerns with regulatory bodies like the CMA and Ofcom introduces uncertainty. Regulatory investigations can be lengthy and costly, and potential restrictions on Apple's business practices could negatively impact future revenue streams. However, Apple has a history of successfully navigating regulatory challenges and has stated its intention to engage constructively with the CMA. The impact is likely to be moderate in the short term, as the concerns are about potential future dominance rather than current illegal practices. The article also mentions Apple's response, highlighting its belief in thriving markets and its contribution to the app economy, which could mitigate some negative sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but neither is overwhelmingly likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Goldman Sachs maintains a 'Buy' rating and anticipates iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence,  the lowered price target from $286 to $280 reflects concerns about slower revenue growth and increased competition in China.  The article also highlights the rapid advancements in AI agents, suggesting that other companies might be making faster strides in AI than Apple.  The overall tone is somewhat cautious, acknowledging Apple's position in the AI market but suggesting other AI stocks might offer better returns.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, although the difference is not significant given the mixed signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the news content suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools position it as a resilient stock in potential bear markets. The company's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further strengthens its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact AAPL's stock price. The presence of hedge fund interest and the stock's inclusion in lists of best bear market stocks indicate underlying confidence, but the macroeconomic risks cannot be ignored. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both outcomes are plausible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been struggling lately, with its stock price down about 15% from the 52-week high hit around Christmas. Persistent worries about China and its AI strategy have contributed to this decline. However, some analysts believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and that Apple will announce a local AI partner soon, which could potentially boost its stock price. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 for Apple is $7.40, which is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back. This indicates that estimates for the company's future performance have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the fact that Apple's stock has lagged behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, there is a possibility that the stock price could rise if the company announces positive news or shows improvement in its AI strategy. However, the probability of a stock price rise or fall also depends on the company's ability to address its challenges, such as the China headwinds and AI strategy. Based on the provided information, it seems that Apple's stock price might be under pressure due to these concerns, but there is still a chance for a positive surprise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential stranglehold on the smartphone market due to the rise of eSims, which could allow Apple to tighten its grip on the market and squeeze out mobile networks. However, this news is more of a regulatory concern rather than a direct impact on Apple's current financials or operations. The article also mentions that Apple faces competition in every segment and jurisdiction, and the company's focus is on the trust of its users. Given that the news is not directly related to Apple's financial performance or product sales, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Nevertheless, the regulatory scrutiny and potential competition concerns may slightly weigh on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been underperforming compared to its peers and the broader market, primarily due to concerns over China and AI strategy. Despite some bullish sentiments regarding potential AI partnerships, recent earnings estimates have been under pressure, suggesting a cautious market outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current price of $223.

However, there are risks mentioned, such as declining earnings over the past year and slower growth compared to the broader market, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the undervaluation and growth potential lead to a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the mixed signals from previous predictions indicate some caution in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT and Virgin Media O2 regarding Apple's potential dominance due to eSIM technology. This could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potentially impact Apple's future business practices. While Apple has stated its intention to engage constructively with regulators, the uncertainty surrounding potential restrictions on its market power could negatively affect investor sentiment. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to regulatory concerns and underperformance compared to peers. Considering the negative sentiment expressed by BT and Virgin Media O2, and the potential for regulatory action, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, Apple's strong market position and history of navigating regulatory challenges mitigate the potential for a significant drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Goldman Sachs maintains a buy rating and anticipates future iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence, concerns remain about slower current revenue growth and increased competition, reflected in a lowered price target.  The article also highlights the rapid advancements in AI by other companies, suggesting Apple might be lagging in this crucial area.  The previous predictions are quite varied, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 probability of a price rise.  The overall sentiment is cautious, with several models leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of overwhelmingly positive news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the near-term concerns outweighing the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Apple's stock has been underperforming compared to its peers and the broader market, primarily due to concerns over China and its AI strategy. Despite some bullish sentiments regarding potential AI partnerships, recent earnings estimates have been under pressure, suggesting a cautious market outlook. However, the overall earnings growth expectations for the 'Mag 7' stocks, including Apple, are positive, with a forecasted growth in annual earnings over the next few years. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a stock price fall, but both outcomes are plausible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential stranglehold on the smartphone market due to the rise of eSims.

(AAPL). On one hand, the stock has struggled due to concerns over China and its AI strategy, leading to a 15% drop since its 52-week high. There are also worries about potential guidance cuts and decreased future earnings estimates. On the other hand, there is bullish sentiment among some analysts who believe the current negative outlook might be overdone, and that Apple might announce a local AI partner, which could positively impact the stock. However, the provided predictions from various models generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, indicating a cautious market sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc.

Goldman Sachs's 'Buy' rating and prediction of future iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence are positive. However, concerns remain about slower current revenue growth, increased competition in China (leading to a lowered price target), and the rapid advancements in AI by competitors.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, with a slight tendency towards a price fall.  The regulatory concerns regarding eSIMs and Apple's potential market dominance add further uncertainty. While Apple's strong brand and financial health provide a buffer, the near-term headwinds seem to outweigh the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence, at least in the short term. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of overwhelmingly positive news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the near-term concerns outweighing the long-term potential. The consensus of previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, which I'm giving some weight to.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
