      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current price of $223. This suggests a potential for price appreciation as investors may view the stock as a buying opportunity. Additionally, the forecasted growth in annual earnings over the next three years supports a positive outlook. However, there are also risks mentioned, such as declining earnings over the past year and slower growth compared to the broader market, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the undervaluation and growth potential lead to a higher probability of a price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest potential regulatory scrutiny for Apple due to concerns about its market power and the rise of eSIMs. While the article doesn't indicate immediate action, the fact that BT and Virgin Media O2 are raising concerns with regulatory bodies like the CMA and Ofcom introduces uncertainty. Regulatory investigations can be lengthy and costly, and potential restrictions on Apple's business practices could negatively impact future revenue streams. However, Apple has a history of successfully navigating regulatory challenges and has stated its intention to engage constructively with the CMA. The impact is likely to be moderate in the short term, as the concerns are about potential future dominance rather than current illegal practices. The article also mentions Apple's response, highlighting its belief in thriving markets and its contribution to the app economy, which could mitigate some negative sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but neither is overwhelmingly likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Goldman Sachs maintains a 'Buy' rating and anticipates iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence,  the lowered price target from $286 to $280 reflects concerns about slower revenue growth and increased competition in China.  The article also highlights the rapid advancements in AI agents, suggesting that other companies might be making faster strides in AI than Apple.  The overall tone is somewhat cautious, acknowledging Apple's position in the AI market but suggesting other AI stocks might offer better returns.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, although the difference is not significant given the mixed signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the news content suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent revenue growth, and innovative product features like AI integration and health-monitoring tools position it as a resilient stock in potential bear markets. The company's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further strengthens its appeal. However, broader economic concerns such as potential inflation spikes, interest rate fluctuations, and a possible cooling-off period in the technology sector could negatively impact AAPL's stock price. The presence of hedge fund interest and the stock's inclusion in lists of best bear market stocks indicate underlying confidence, but the macroeconomic risks cannot be ignored. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both outcomes are plausible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been struggling lately, with its stock price down about 15% from the 52-week high hit around Christmas. Persistent worries about China and its AI strategy have contributed to this decline. However, some analysts believe that the downbeat sentiment is overdone and that Apple will announce a local AI partner soon, which could potentially boost its stock price. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 for Apple is $7.40, which is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back. This indicates that estimates for the company's future performance have been under pressure. Given the mixed sentiment and the fact that Apple's stock has lagged behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, there is a possibility that the stock price could rise if the company announces positive news or shows improvement in its AI strategy. However, the probability of a stock price rise or fall also depends on the company's ability to address its challenges, such as the China headwinds and AI strategy. Based on the provided information, it seems that Apple's stock price might be under pressure due to these concerns, but there is still a chance for a positive surprise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential stranglehold on the smartphone market due to the rise of eSims, which could allow Apple to tighten its grip on the market and squeeze out mobile networks. However, this news is more of a regulatory concern rather than a direct impact on Apple's current financials or operations. The article also mentions that Apple faces competition in every segment and jurisdiction, and the company's focus is on the trust of its users. Given that the news is not directly related to Apple's financial performance or product sales, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Nevertheless, the regulatory scrutiny and potential competition concerns may slightly weigh on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been underperforming compared to its peers and the broader market, primarily due to concerns over China and AI strategy. Despite some bullish sentiments regarding potential AI partnerships, recent earnings estimates have been under pressure, suggesting a cautious market outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc.

This could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potentially impact Apple's future business practices. While Apple has stated its intention to engage constructively with regulators, the uncertainty surrounding potential restrictions on its market power could negatively affect investor sentiment. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to regulatory concerns and underperformance compared to peers. Considering the negative sentiment expressed by BT and Virgin Media O2, and the potential for regulatory action, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, Apple's strong market position and history of navigating regulatory challenges mitigate the potential for a significant drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Goldman Sachs maintains a buy rating and anticipates future iPhone growth driven by Apple Intelligence, concerns remain about slower current revenue growth and increased competition, reflected in a lowered price target.  The article also highlights the rapid advancements in AI by other companies, suggesting Apple might be lagging in this crucial area.  The previous predictions are quite varied, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 probability of a price rise.  The overall sentiment is cautious, with several models leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of overwhelmingly positive news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the near-term concerns outweighing the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Despite some bullish sentiments regarding potential AI partnerships, recent earnings estimates have been under pressure, suggesting a cautious market outlook. However, the overall earnings growth expectations for the 'Mag 7' stocks, including Apple, are positive, with a forecasted growth in annual earnings over the next few years. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a stock price fall, but both outcomes are plausible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential stranglehold on the smartphone market due to the rise of eSims.

(AAPL). On one hand, the stock has struggled due to concerns over China and its AI strategy, leading to a 15% drop since its 52-week high. There are also worries about potential guidance cuts and decreased future earnings estimates. On the other hand, there is bullish sentiment among some analysts who believe the current negative outlook might be overdone, and that Apple might announce a local AI partner, which could positively impact the stock.

The regulatory concerns regarding eSIMs and Apple's potential market dominance add further uncertainty. While Apple's strong brand and financial health provide a buffer, the near-term headwinds seem to outweigh the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence, at least in the short term. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of overwhelmingly positive news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the near-term concerns outweighing the long-term potential.
