(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment towards the stock. Such downgrades can lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially resulting in selling pressure. Given the significance of the rating and its rarity, it is likely to have a more pronounced impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals a negative outlook on the stock. While Apple is a strong company, analyst ratings can influence investor sentiment and trigger selling pressure, at least in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could mitigate the negative impact. The actual impact will depend on the analyst's reputation, the specific reasons cited for the downgrade, and the overall market conditions. Given the limited information, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price decrease, but acknowledging Apple's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (increased revenue and earnings, dividend payouts), the broader economic picture is uncertain.  Experts offer conflicting predictions: some foresee a potential bear market with significant declines (up to 40%), citing factors like high inflation, interest rate hikes, and increased foreign investment (historically a bearish indicator). Others are more optimistic, projecting continued economic growth.  The article highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks,' suggesting some resilience, but also notes that other stocks are considered more promising.  The article's focus on Apple's strong financials and its position in the bear market stock list suggests a slightly higher probability of price stability or even a modest rise compared to a sharp fall. However, the overall market uncertainty significantly impacts the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s poor performance at the start of 2025, with an 11% decline year-to-date, making it the worst performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level, which could signal further losses if breached. Analysts express concerns about the stock's uptrend losing confidence if this level is broken. However, there is optimism around Apple's upcoming earnings report on January 30, with some analysts predicting potential growth in services and wearables despite a softer iPhone cycle. Additionally, President Trump's announcement of a 'massive investment' in the U.S. could provide some positive sentiment. Given the mixed signals\u2014technical weakness versus fundamental optimism\u2014the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards further downside due to the immediate technical pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF and does not specifically focus on AAPL. Therefore, it's unlikely that this news will have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as neutral, with a slight bias towards no change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI market, its recent launch of Apple Intelligence, and the potential for growth driven by the rollout of new features. However, it also mentions slower revenue growth and increasing competition in the Chinese market. Goldman Sachs has reiterated a 'Buy' rating for the stock but lowered its price target due to lower iPhone sales. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, with a potential for growth in the mid-year due to new feature releases and product launches.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a DCF model estimating its fair value at $279 per share compared to its current share price of $223. This undervaluation could potentially attract investors, thereby increasing demand and driving the stock price upwards. Additionally, the company shows strength in covering debt with earnings and cashflows, and opportunities for growth in the next three years, which further supports the positive outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of Apple receiving a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment, which can lead to decreased investor confidence and selling pressure. Previous predictions indicate a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with estimates ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 for a decline. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty may provide some support, the rarity of the downgrade suggests a significant impact. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The initial news of an 'Underperform' rating is negative. The previous round's predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price decrease and others towards a price increase or neutrality, often citing Apple's strong fundamentals as a mitigating factor. The trend seems to be shifting towards a more balanced or even slightly positive outlook in later rounds, possibly due to consideration of Apple's resilience and potential growth factors. Given the initial negative signal and the mixed but slightly improving sentiment in the previous predictions, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not as high as the initial predictions suggested, acknowledging the potential for Apple to weather the negative rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  While Apple demonstrates strong financial health with increased revenue and earnings, the overall economic climate is uncertain.  Predictions range from cautious optimism to a potential 40% market decline.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best bear market stocks' suggests some resilience, but the article also highlights concerns about AI adoption impacting the tech sector and the historically bearish signal of increased foreign investment in US stocks.  The conflicting expert opinions and the lack of a specific catalyst directly impacting Apple's stock price in this news piece make a definitive prediction difficult.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.25 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the overall uncertainty, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The strong fundamentals of Apple suggest a higher probability of a price rise than a significant fall, but the market uncertainty warrants caution.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline year-to-date, making it the weakest performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group.

However, Apple's strong fundamentals, brand loyalty, and potential for future growth (especially in AI) are mitigating factors. The previous rounds of predictions show a wide range of opinions, with a slight trend towards a more balanced outlook in later rounds, suggesting that the initial negative impact might be less severe than initially anticipated. Considering the negative signal from the analyst downgrade, balanced by Apple's inherent strengths and the mixed sentiment in previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  While Apple's Q4 2024 financials show strong performance (increased revenue and earnings, dividend payouts), significant uncertainty exists regarding the overall economic climate.  Expert opinions are sharply divided: some predict a substantial market downturn (up to 40%), citing inflation, interest rate hikes, and historically bearish indicators like increased foreign investment. Others are optimistic, forecasting robust growth.  Apple's inclusion in a 'best bear market stocks' list suggests resilience, but the article also highlights potential headwinds from AI adoption and competition.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting this uncertainty.  However, the consistent strong financial performance of Apple, its position as a leading tech company, and its inclusion in several 'best bear market stocks' lists suggest a higher likelihood of price stability or even a modest rise than a sharp decline.  The overall market uncertainty is a significant factor, but Apple's fundamentals provide a buffer against a major fall. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise, acknowledging the potential for market volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s poor performance at the start of 2025, with an 11% decline year-to-date, making it the worst performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group.
