(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\nNews Content: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a turbulent beginning to 2025, with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.\n\nWhat Happened: Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth\u2019s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest\u00a0performer in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019\u00a0group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nApple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock\u2019s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.\n\n\u201cWhen\u00a0you get names starting to\u00a0flirt with it or start\u00a0to break below it, you\u00a0kind of lose confidence that\u00a0the uptrend of that name\u00a0is still intact,\u201d Todd Sohn, an ETF\u00a0and technical strategist at Strategas\u00a0Securities LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple\u2019s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline, Nvidia has now overtaken Apple in market value.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. \"It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we're anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off,\" said Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC.\n\nTrending: Coinbase\u2019s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) \u2014 Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer.\n\nApple is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on January 30, after market close, an event that investors are closely watching.\u00a0Despite the stock\u2019s current performance, analysts remain optimistic about Apple\u2019s future. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, believes that Apple\u2019s dependence on the iPhone remains, but services and wearables offer growth potential. Additionally, Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Securities predicts that Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings might not miss a beat, despite a softer iPhone cycle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Apple was planning a \u201cmassive investment\u201d in the United States. This was part of Trump\u2019s initiative to accelerate major corporate investments in the U.S.\n\nPrice Action: Apple shares ended 0.39% lower on Friday. Year-to-date the company\u2019s shares lost 8.64%, as reported by Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\n\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment towards the stock. Such downgrades can lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially resulting in selling pressure. Given the significance of the rating and its rarity, it is likely to have a more pronounced impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals a negative outlook on the stock. While Apple is a strong company, analyst ratings can influence investor sentiment and trigger selling pressure, at least in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could mitigate the negative impact. The actual impact will depend on the analyst's reputation, the specific reasons cited for the downgrade, and the overall market conditions. Given the limited information, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price decrease, but acknowledging Apple's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (increased revenue and earnings, dividend payouts), the broader economic picture is uncertain.  Experts offer conflicting predictions: some foresee a potential bear market with significant declines (up to 40%), citing factors like high inflation, interest rate hikes, and increased foreign investment (historically a bearish indicator). Others are more optimistic, projecting continued economic growth.  The article highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks,' suggesting some resilience, but also notes that other stocks are considered more promising.  The article's focus on Apple's strong financials and its position in the bear market stock list suggests a slightly higher probability of price stability or even a modest rise compared to a sharp fall. However, the overall market uncertainty significantly impacts the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s poor performance at the start of 2025, with an 11% decline year-to-date, making it the worst performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level, which could signal further losses if breached. Analysts express concerns about the stock's uptrend losing confidence if this level is broken. However, there is optimism around Apple's upcoming earnings report on January 30, with some analysts predicting potential growth in services and wearables despite a softer iPhone cycle. Additionally, President Trump's announcement of a 'massive investment' in the U.S. could provide some positive sentiment. Given the mixed signals\u2014technical weakness versus fundamental optimism\u2014the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards further downside due to the immediate technical pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF and does not specifically focus on AAPL. Therefore, it's unlikely that this news will have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as neutral, with a slight bias towards no change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI market, its recent launch of Apple Intelligence, and the potential for growth driven by the rollout of new features. However, it also mentions slower revenue growth and increasing competition in the Chinese market. Goldman Sachs has reiterated a 'Buy' rating for the stock but lowered its price target due to lower iPhone sales. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, with a potential for growth in the mid-year due to new feature releases and product launches.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a DCF model estimating its fair value at $279 per share compared to its current share price of $223. This undervaluation could potentially attract investors, thereby increasing demand and driving the stock price upwards. Additionally, the company shows strength in covering debt with earnings and cashflows, and opportunities for growth in the next three years, which further supports the positive outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
