In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence.\n\nA prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nDubbed the \u201cOperator\u201d, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields.\n\n\u201cThis capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications\u201d.\n\nOpenAI says Operator is \u201can agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you\u201d. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations.\n\nThe company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows.\n\n\u201cOperator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it\u201d.\n\nBased on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention.\n\n\u201cAI agents are going to get deployed.

As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls for Thursday, January 23, has been for Apple Inc. Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cBuy\u201d and lowered its price target to $280 per share from $286. The price target downgrade, driven by lower iPhone sales, comes ahead of the company\u2019s December-quarter earnings report next week. The firm anticipates the tech giant to report fiscal Q1 earnings per share of $2.35, in line with consensus, and revenue of $124.2B versus the consensus of $124.8B. According to the firm, even though the competition within the Chinese market is increasing, it is optimistic about accelerating iPhone growth in fiscal 2026. This iPhone growth will largely be driven by the continued rollout of Apple Intelligence with a more robust feature set.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate market sentiment to improve midyear, which is a seasonally strong period for the stock, as concerns about Apple Intelligence\u2019s limited impact on iPhone demand and competition in China are replaced by optimism over the new slate of Apple Intelligence features revealed at WWDC 2025, the launch of new Mac, iPad and iPhone SE products in spring 2025, and potential new features for the iPhone 17/18 in fall 2025/26\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically signals negative sentiment towards the stock. Such downgrades can lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially resulting in selling pressure. Given the significance of the rating and its rarity, it is likely to have a more pronounced impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: A rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals a negative outlook on the stock. While Apple is a strong company, analyst ratings can influence investor sentiment and trigger selling pressure, at least in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could mitigate the negative impact. The actual impact will depend on the analyst's reputation, the specific reasons cited for the downgrade, and the overall market conditions. Given the limited information, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price decrease, but acknowledging Apple's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (increased revenue and earnings, dividend payouts), the broader economic picture is uncertain.  Experts offer conflicting predictions: some foresee a potential bear market with significant declines (up to 40%), citing factors like high inflation, interest rate hikes, and increased foreign investment (historically a bearish indicator). Others are more optimistic, projecting continued economic growth.  The article highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks,' suggesting some resilience, but also notes that other stocks are considered more promising.  The article's focus on Apple's strong financials and its position in the bear market stock list suggests a slightly higher probability of price stability or even a modest rise compared to a sharp fall. However, the overall market uncertainty significantly impacts the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s poor performance at the start of 2025, with an 11% decline year-to-date, making it the worst performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level, which could signal further losses if breached. Analysts express concerns about the stock's uptrend losing confidence if this level is broken. However, there is optimism around Apple's upcoming earnings report on January 30, with some analysts predicting potential growth in services and wearables despite a softer iPhone cycle. Additionally, President Trump's announcement of a 'massive investment' in the U.S. could provide some positive sentiment. Given the mixed signals\u2014technical weakness versus fundamental optimism\u2014the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards further downside due to the immediate technical pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF and does not specifically focus on AAPL. Therefore, it's unlikely that this news will have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as neutral, with a slight bias towards no change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI market, its recent launch of Apple Intelligence, and the potential for growth driven by the rollout of new features. However, it also mentions slower revenue growth and increasing competition in the Chinese market. Goldman Sachs has reiterated a 'Buy' rating for the stock but lowered its price target due to lower iPhone sales. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, with a potential for growth in the mid-year due to new feature releases and product launches.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a DCF model estimating its fair value at $279 per share compared to its current share price of $223. This undervaluation could potentially attract investors, thereby increasing demand and driving the stock price upwards. Additionally, the company shows strength in covering debt with earnings and cashflows, and opportunities for growth in the next three years, which further supports the positive outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of Apple receiving a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment, which can lead to decreased investor confidence and selling pressure. Previous predictions indicate a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with estimates ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 for a decline. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty may provide some support, the rarity of the downgrade suggests a significant impact. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The initial news of an 'Underperform' rating is negative. The previous round's predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price decrease and others towards a price increase or neutrality, often citing Apple's strong fundamentals as a mitigating factor. The trend seems to be shifting towards a more balanced or even slightly positive outlook in later rounds, possibly due to consideration of Apple's resilience and potential growth factors. Given the initial negative signal and the mixed but slightly improving sentiment in the previous predictions, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not as high as the initial predictions suggested, acknowledging the potential for Apple to weather the negative rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  While Apple demonstrates strong financial health with increased revenue and earnings, the overall economic climate is uncertain.  Predictions range from cautious optimism to a potential 40% market decline.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best bear market stocks' suggests some resilience, but the article also highlights concerns about AI adoption impacting the tech sector and the historically bearish signal of increased foreign investment in US stocks.  The conflicting expert opinions and the lack of a specific catalyst directly impacting Apple's stock price in this news piece make a definitive prediction difficult.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.25 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the overall uncertainty, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The strong fundamentals of Apple suggest a higher probability of a price rise than a significant fall, but the market uncertainty warrants caution.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline year-to-date, making it the weakest performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level, which could signal further losses if breached. Analysts express concerns about the stock's uptrend losing confidence if this level is broken. However, there is optimism around Apple's upcoming earnings report on January 30, with some analysts predicting potential growth in services and wearables despite a softer iPhone cycle. Additionally, President Trump's announcement of a 'massive investment' in the U.S. could provide some positive sentiment.

Given the lack of direct relevance to AAPL, it's unlikely that this news will have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the general market trends and the performance of tech stocks, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could mitigate any negative impact. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed outlook, with some indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling and others suggesting a more neutral or slightly positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI market, its recent launch of Apple Intelligence, and the potential for growth driven by the rollout of new features. However, it also mentions slower revenue growth and increasing competition in the Chinese market. Goldman Sachs has reiterated a 'Buy' rating for the stock but lowered its price target due to lower iPhone sales. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, with a potential for growth in the mid-year due to new feature releases and product launches. Additionally, the fact that Apple ranks 2nd on the list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street and has a large number of hedge fund holders suggests a level of confidence in the company's prospects. Taking into account the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions from slightly negative to positive, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling as follows.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a DCF model estimating its fair value at $279 per share compared to its current share price of $223. This undervaluation could potentially attract investors, thereby increasing demand and driving the stock price upwards. Additionally, the company shows strength in covering debt with earnings and cashflows, and opportunities for growth in the next three years, which further supports the positive outlook. The news also highlights that Apple is a resilient company with strong fundamentals and brand loyalty, which could mitigate the impact of any analyst ratings or short-term market conditions. The overall mix of positive factors and market perception suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of Apple receiving a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst typically signals negative sentiment, which can lead to decreased investor confidence and selling pressure. Previous predictions indicate a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with estimates ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 for a decline. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty may provide some support, the rarity of the downgrade suggests a significant impact. Additionally, the mixed outlook from other models, with some indicating resilience due to Apple's financial health, suggests that while there is potential for some upward movement, the overall sentiment remains negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The initial news of a rare 'Underperform' rating is undoubtedly negative and typically leads to selling pressure. However, Apple's strong fundamentals, brand loyalty, and potential for future growth (especially in AI) are mitigating factors. The previous rounds of predictions show a wide range of opinions, with a slight trend towards a more balanced outlook in later rounds, suggesting that the initial negative impact might be less severe than initially anticipated. Considering the negative signal from the analyst downgrade, balanced by Apple's inherent strengths and the mixed sentiment in previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  While Apple's Q4 2024 financials show strong performance (increased revenue and earnings, dividend payouts), significant uncertainty exists regarding the overall economic climate.  Expert opinions are sharply divided: some predict a substantial market downturn (up to 40%), citing inflation, interest rate hikes, and historically bearish indicators like increased foreign investment. Others are optimistic, forecasting robust growth.  Apple's inclusion in a 'best bear market stocks' list suggests resilience, but the article also highlights potential headwinds from AI adoption and competition.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting this uncertainty.  However, the consistent strong financial performance of Apple, its position as a leading tech company, and its inclusion in several 'best bear market stocks' lists suggest a higher likelihood of price stability or even a modest rise than a sharp decline.  The overall market uncertainty is a significant factor, but Apple's fundamentals provide a buffer against a major fall. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise, acknowledging the potential for market volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s poor performance at the start of 2025, with an 11% decline year-to-date, making it the worst performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group.
