While Apple is a strong company, analyst ratings can influence investor sentiment and trigger selling pressure, at least in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could mitigate the negative impact. The actual impact will depend on the analyst's reputation, the specific reasons cited for the downgrade, and the overall market conditions. Given the limited information, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price decrease, but acknowledging Apple's resilience.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst.
