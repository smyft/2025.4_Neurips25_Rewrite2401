(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\nNews Content: Market Domination Overtime hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton detail the top market events on the horizon for the upcoming week.\n\nA slew of Big Tech earnings is scheduled for release, with industry giants Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL) preparing to unveil their quarterly results. Artificial intelligence will be a central theme in these earnings reports.\n\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve's January Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will commence on Tuesday, with the central bank's interest rate decision set to be announced on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.\n\nThis post was written by Angel Smith Related Videos\n\n05:47\n\n3 housing market tips for homebuyers, yet 'no perfect moment'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 hours ago 00:55\n\nBlackRock's Chaudhuri on the growing appeal of gold and bitcoin\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago 04:59\n\nFrom FANG to BATMMAAN, the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 6 hours ago 48:55\n\nBoeing outlook, banking rule, Meta's AI spending: Market Domination\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is optimism regarding the company's AI initiatives and potential future growth, the downgrade in price target by Goldman Sachs due to lower iPhone sales creates a bearish sentiment. The anticipation of a strong midyear performance and the potential for new product launches could support a price rise, but the immediate concerns about revenue growth and competition in the Chinese market weigh heavily. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight inclination towards a price fall due to the recent downgrade and lower sales expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline 'How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)' is about an ETF, not directly about Apple (AAPL). While VTI holds Apple stock, the article's focus is on investing in the ETF itself. This news is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. It might have a very slight positive impact if increased investment in VTI leads to increased demand for Apple shares as part of the ETF's holdings, but this effect would be minimal and diluted across all the companies in the ETF. Therefore, the probabilities are close to neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock.  While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the market.  The mention of Cohen buying another AI stock is a distraction and doesn't directly influence Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a large investor selling shares, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's potential dividend income from five stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article mentions that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, it also notes that Buffett's position in the company is much lower now than it was a couple of years ago. The article estimates that Berkshire will receive $300 million in dividend income from Apple in 2025, assuming no change in dividend or stake. However, the article does not provide any directly positive or negative sentiment about Apple's stock price. The neutral tone and focus on dividend income rather than stock price performance suggest that the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst. This negative sentiment from a reputable source may lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in this information or that other positive factors could outweigh this negative rating, leading to a rise in stock price. Given the rare nature of the underperform rating, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the tech giants whose quarterly results are coming up next week, along with other significant industry players like Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META). The earnings reports are expected to revolve around artificial intelligence, which could positively impact investor sentiment if the company shows strong performance in this area. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision might influence overall market sentiment, but it's uncertain how specific it will affect AAPL. Therefore, while there is potential for positive news from earnings, the broader market may react to the Fed's decision.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
