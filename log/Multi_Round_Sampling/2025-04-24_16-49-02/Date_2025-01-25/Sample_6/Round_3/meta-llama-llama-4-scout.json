      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is likely to be influenced by the overall sentiment surrounding Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. If the earnings report meets or exceeds expectations, particularly in the context of AI developments, it could lead to a positive stock price movement. Conversely, if the Fed raises interest rates, it may negatively impact tech stocks, including AAPL. Given the mixed signals from the earnings and macroeconomic factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the anticipation of strong earnings.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news piece highlights two major factors influencing Apple's stock price: upcoming earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to focus on AI, which could be a positive catalyst if Apple demonstrates strong AI initiatives. However, the overall market sentiment towards tech earnings will play a significant role. The Fed's interest rate decision is a broader macroeconomic factor. A dovish stance (rate cuts or signals of future cuts) is generally positive for stocks, while a hawkish stance (rate hikes or signals of future hikes) is generally negative. Without specific details on Apple's expected earnings or the anticipated Fed decision, it's difficult to give a precise probability. I'm assuming a slightly positive outlook due to the potential for positive AI news and the market's general anticipation of a less hawkish Fed. However, earnings are always a risk, and a negative surprise could easily send the stock down.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for the stock market and Apple specifically. While Apple shows strong financial performance (increased revenue and earnings, dividend payouts), the broader economic context is uncertain.  Experts offer conflicting predictions: some foresee a potential bear market with significant declines (up to 40%), citing factors like high inflation, interest rate hikes, and increased foreign investment (historically a bearish indicator). Others are more optimistic, projecting continued economic growth.  The article highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of 'best bear market stocks,' suggesting some resilience, but also notes that other stocks are considered more promising.  The article's focus on Apple's strong financials and its position in the bear market stock list suggests a slightly higher probability of price stability or even a modest rise compared to a sharp fall. However, the overall market uncertainty significantly impacts the prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is a negative signal for the stock. Analyst ratings can significantly influence investor sentiment, especially when they deviate from the consensus. An 'Underperform' rating suggests the analyst believes the stock will do worse than the market or its peers. This could lead to increased selling pressure as investors react to the downgrade. Historically, such ratings have been associated with short-term stock price declines. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diversified product portfolio, and overall market position might mitigate some of the negative impact. The probability of a fall is higher than a rise, but not absolute.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Billionaire Steven Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple (AAPL) and started a small position in Axon Enterprise (AXON), an AI stock that has risen 500% in less than 3 years. Apple's recent performance issues, including a decline in iPhone sales in China and potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to a pending lawsuit, may negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the company's high valuation of 33 times earnings and the lack of a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features may contribute to a decrease in stock price. On the other hand, Axon Enterprise has shown solid financial results, with a 32% increase in revenue and a 19% increase in non-GAAP earnings, and has a growing addressable market. However, the high valuation of Axon Enterprise, with a multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings, may be a concern.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst. This rating suggests that the analyst has a negative outlook on the company's future performance, which could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and subsequently, a fall in the stock price. However, it's also possible that the market may not react strongly to this single rating, especially if other analysts maintain their positive outlook on the company. Additionally, Apple's strong brand and financials may help mitigate the impact of this negative rating.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is about how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news content does not mention Apple Inc. or any factors that would specifically impact AAPL's stock price, it is unlikely that this news would have a direct effect on the movement of AAPL's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant event that could influence its stock price. The focus on AI in the earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, suggests potential positive catalysts if the company demonstrates strong AI initiatives. However, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision adds a layer of uncertainty; a hawkish stance could negatively impact tech stocks. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some indicating a higher probability of a price fall due to negative analyst ratings and concerns about Apple's recent performance. Balancing these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the anticipation of strong earnings, but the overall market sentiment and macroeconomic factors weigh heavily on this outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, and the Fed's interest rate decision. AI is highlighted as a key theme for earnings reports. The previous rounds show a shift from a slightly positive outlook to a more negative one, primarily due to analyst downgrades and concerns about Apple's performance in China. However, this news doesn't contain any specific negative information about Apple itself, only the general anticipation of earnings and the Fed decision. Given the mixed signals and the potential for positive AI-related news from Apple, I'm leaning towards a neutral stance, but slightly favoring a rise due to the potential for positive earnings surprises. The previous rounds' negative sentiment is considered, but the lack of specific negative news in this article tempers that influence.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market. While Apple's Q4 2024 financials show strong performance (increased revenue and earnings), the macroeconomic environment is uncertain.  Expert opinions are divided: some predict a potential bear market, citing inflation, interest rate hikes, and increased foreign investment as bearish indicators. Others remain optimistic about economic growth.  Apple's inclusion in a 'best bear market stocks' list suggests resilience, but the article also highlights other stocks as potentially more promising.  The conflicting predictions and the overall market uncertainty make it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting this uncertainty. Considering the strong Q4 results and Apple's generally robust position, a slight upward bias is warranted, but the significant market risks cannot be ignored.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both remain significant possibilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is a significant negative signal. Analyst ratings can heavily influence investor sentiment, particularly when they deviate from the consensus. An 'Underperform' rating suggests that the analyst believes the stock will perform worse than the market or its peers, which could lead to increased selling pressure. Given Apple's strong brand loyalty and diversified product portfolio, the impact might be somewhat mitigated, but the negative sentiment from such a rating is likely to dominate in the short term. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, aligning with this reasoning.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and started a small position in Axon Enterprise (AXON), an AI stock that has risen 500% in less than 3 years. Apple's recent performance issues, including a decline in iPhone sales in China and potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to a pending lawsuit, may negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, the company's high valuation of 33 times earnings and the lack of a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features may contribute to a decrease in stock price. These factors suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has received a rare 'Underperform' rating from a Wall Street analyst, which is a negative signal for the stock. This, combined with the mixed predictions from other models, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diversified product portfolio, and overall market position might mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the trend of others' beliefs, with multiple models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate a probability of stock price rise lower than 0.5 and a probability of stock price fall higher than 0.5.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is about how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news content does not mention Apple Inc. or any factors that would specifically impact AAPL's stock price, it is unlikely that this news would have a direct effect on the movement of AAPL's stock price. The previous predictions suggest various reasons for stock price movements, but none of them are related to this specific news. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall due to this news is minimal.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc.

However, the Fed's decision and overall market sentiment weigh heavily on this outlook. Therefore, I adjust the probabilities to reflect this uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple and the broader market.  While Apple's Q4 2024 financials are strong, significant macroeconomic uncertainty exists.  Expert opinions are sharply divided, with some predicting a substantial bear market and others forecasting continued growth.  The inclusion of AAPL in a 'best bear market stocks' list suggests some resilience, but the article also highlights other stocks as potentially more promising.  Previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting this uncertainty.  The strong Q4 results and Apple's generally robust position suggest a slight upward bias, but the significant market risks cannot be ignored.  The weight of negative predictions from previous rounds, particularly those citing analyst downgrades and concerns about Apple's performance in China and the potential impact of a pending lawsuit, significantly influences my assessment.  The lack of specific negative news in this particular article tempers the negative sentiment somewhat, but the overall uncertainty remains high.  Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the prevailing uncertainty and the weight of negative predictions from previous rounds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.
