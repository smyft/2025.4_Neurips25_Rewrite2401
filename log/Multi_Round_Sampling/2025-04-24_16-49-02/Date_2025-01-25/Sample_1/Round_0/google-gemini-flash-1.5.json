While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the market.  The mention of Cohen buying an AI stock is a distraction and irrelevant to Apple's stock price prediction.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```\n"
