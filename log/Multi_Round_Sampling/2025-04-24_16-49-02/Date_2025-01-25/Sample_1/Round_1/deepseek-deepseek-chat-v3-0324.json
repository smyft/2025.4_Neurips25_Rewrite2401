A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. ahead of its earnings report. While there are concerns about the company's performance, particularly regarding its AI strategy and challenges in China, some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone. The stock has recently underperformed compared to its peers, and there are bearish projections regarding guidance cuts. However, the overall earnings season has shown positive results for many companies, which could provide a supportive backdrop for Apple. Given the uncertainty and the recent decline in stock value, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple might increase its dividend, which is a positive signal. However, it also mentions Buffett *could* sell more stock. Overall, the news is mildly positive for Apple. The dividend income is substantial, and a potential dividend increase is a positive catalyst. However, the possibility of Buffett selling more shares introduces some uncertainty. The overall market sentiment and Apple's general performance will likely have a greater impact than this news alone. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock.  While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the market.  The mention of Cohen buying an AI stock is a distraction and irrelevant to Apple's stock price prediction.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The content is more of a historical overview of tech stock groupings rather than a direct analysis of Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. Such a rating is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, the impact of a single analyst's rating, especially if it is rare, might be limited compared to the overall market sentiment and the company's fundamentals. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to this news, but not a certainty, as investors may already have priced in some level of skepticism or the news might not significantly alter the long-term outlook for the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a little-known AI stock that has seen significant growth. This action by a prominent investor may be perceived as a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects or a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies like AI. However, it's also important to consider that individual investor actions, even those of billionaires, do not necessarily dictate market trends or the overall performance of a company like Apple, which has a diverse portfolio and a strong market presence. The sale of Apple stock by one investor could lead to a slight decrease in stock price due to the potential perception of decreased investor confidence, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal given the vast market and investor base of Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. The market typically reacts negatively to such analyst downgrades.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
