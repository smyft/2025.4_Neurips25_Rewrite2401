(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?\nNews Content: In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It Time to Sell the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. ahead of its earnings report. While there are concerns about the company's performance, particularly regarding its AI strategy and challenges in China, some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone. The stock has recently underperformed compared to its peers, and there are bearish projections regarding guidance cuts. However, the overall earnings season has shown positive results for many companies, which could provide a supportive backdrop for Apple. Given the uncertainty and the recent decline in stock value, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple might increase its dividend, which is a positive signal. However, it also mentions Buffett *could* sell more stock. Overall, the news is mildly positive for Apple. The dividend income is substantial, and a potential dividend increase is a positive catalyst. However, the possibility of Buffett selling more shares introduces some uncertainty. The overall market sentiment and Apple's general performance will likely have a greater impact than this news alone. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock.  While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the market.  The mention of Cohen buying an AI stock is a distraction and irrelevant to Apple's stock price prediction.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The content is more of a historical overview of tech stock groupings rather than a direct analysis of Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. Such a rating is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, the impact of a single analyst's rating, especially if it is rare, might be limited compared to the overall market sentiment and the company's fundamentals. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to this news, but not a certainty, as investors may already have priced in some level of skepticism or the news might not significantly alter the long-term outlook for the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a little-known AI stock that has seen significant growth. This action by a prominent investor may be perceived as a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects or a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies like AI. However, it's also important to consider that individual investor actions, even those of billionaires, do not necessarily dictate market trends or the overall performance of a company like Apple, which has a diverse portfolio and a strong market presence. The sale of Apple stock by one investor could lead to a slight decrease in stock price due to the potential perception of decreased investor confidence, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal given the vast market and investor base of Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. The market typically reacts negatively to such analyst downgrades.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. ahead of its earnings report, with concerns about its performance, particularly regarding its AI strategy and challenges in China. While some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone, there are bearish projections regarding guidance cuts and a recent decline in stock value. The overall earnings season has shown positive results for many companies, which could provide a supportive backdrop for Apple. However, the recent underperformance compared to peers and the potential for a guidance cut suggest a higher probability of a price fall. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.4 for the stock price rising and 0.6 for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple might increase its dividend, which is a positive signal. However, it also mentions Buffett *could* sell more stock. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a fall due to negative news, while others predicted a rise due to Buffett's continued holding and potential dividend increase. Given this context, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a more balanced view, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the dividend income and potential increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock and bought an AI stock is the primary focus.  While this is noteworthy, it's crucial to remember that individual investor actions, even those of prominent figures like Cohen, don't always predict market movements.  The lack of information regarding the volume of shares sold and Cohen's reasoning behind the sale makes it difficult to assess the impact.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price fall (0.65, 0.55, 0.55, 0.7, 0.6) and others suggesting a more balanced outlook (0.5, 0.45, 0.35, 0.5).  The absence of other significant news or financial data in the provided headline and content further supports a neutral-to-slightly negative outlook. Considering the overall sentiment from previous predictions and the limited information in the current news, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, but the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc.

Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news, the probabilities are estimated to be neutral, with a slight tilt towards a fall due to the general uncertainty in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. This rating is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, considering the overall market sentiment, Apple's strong business model, and the potential for the company to adapt and grow, the impact of this single rating might be limited. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, with some predicting a higher chance of the stock price falling and others seeing a more balanced or slightly positive outlook. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to the negative sentiment associated with the underperform rating, but not a certainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a little-known AI stock. This action may be perceived as a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, considering the diverse portfolio and strong market presence of Apple, the impact of this news is likely to be minimal. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of slightly higher probabilities of the stock price falling due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares. Given this context and the overall market sentiment, the estimated probabilities of the stock price movement are provided.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, coupled with concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features not resonating with consumers. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. Several previous predictions indicate a consensus that the stock is likely to face downward pressure due to this news. Although there is still value in the services segment, the overall market reaction is likely to be negative.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
