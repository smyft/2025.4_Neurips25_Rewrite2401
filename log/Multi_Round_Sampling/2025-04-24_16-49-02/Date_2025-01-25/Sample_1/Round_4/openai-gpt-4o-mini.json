      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While there are concerns about the company's performance, particularly regarding its AI strategy and challenges in China, some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone. The stock has recently underperformed compared to its peers, and there are bearish projections regarding guidance cuts. However, the overall earnings season has shown positive results for many companies, which could provide a supportive backdrop for Apple. Given the uncertainty and the recent decline in stock value, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple might increase its dividend, which is a positive signal. However, it also mentions Buffett *could* sell more stock. Overall, the news is mildly positive for Apple. The dividend income is substantial, and a potential dividend increase is a positive catalyst. However, the possibility of Buffett selling more shares introduces some uncertainty. The overall market sentiment and Apple's general performance will likely have a greater impact than this news alone. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock.  While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the news lacks specifics about the volume of Apple stock sold, which significantly impacts its influence on the market.  The mention of Cohen buying an AI stock is a distraction and irrelevant to Apple's stock price prediction.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific financial data, earnings reports, or market-moving information about Apple. The content is more of a historical overview of tech stock groupings rather than a direct analysis of Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. Such a rating is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, the impact of a single analyst's rating, especially if it is rare, might be limited compared to the overall market sentiment and the company's fundamentals. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to this news, but not a certainty, as investors may already have priced in some level of skepticism or the news might not significantly alter the long-term outlook for the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a little-known AI stock that has seen significant growth. This action by a prominent investor may be perceived as a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects or a shift in investment strategy towards emerging technologies like AI. However, it's also important to consider that individual investor actions, even those of billionaires, do not necessarily dictate market trends or the overall performance of a company like Apple, which has a diverse portfolio and a strong market presence. The sale of Apple stock by one investor could lead to a slight decrease in stock price due to the potential perception of decreased investor confidence, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal given the vast market and investor base of Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. The market typically reacts negatively to such analyst downgrades.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. ahead of its earnings report, with concerns about its performance, particularly regarding its AI strategy and challenges in China. While some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone, there are bearish projections regarding guidance cuts and a recent decline in stock value. The overall earnings season has shown positive results for many companies, which could provide a supportive backdrop for Apple. However, the recent underperformance compared to peers and the potential for a guidance cut suggest a higher probability of a price fall. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.4 for the stock price rising and 0.6 for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income from five stocks, including Apple. While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple might increase its dividend, which is a positive signal. However, it also mentions Buffett *could* sell more stock. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a fall due to negative news, while others predicted a rise due to Buffett's continued holding and potential dividend increase. Given this context, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a more balanced view, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the dividend income and potential increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock and bought an AI stock is the primary focus.  While this is noteworthy, it's crucial to remember that individual investor actions, even those of prominent figures like Cohen, don't always predict market movements.  The lack of information regarding the volume of shares sold and Cohen's reasoning behind the sale makes it difficult to assess the impact.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price fall (0.65, 0.55, 0.55, 0.7, 0.6) and others suggesting a more balanced outlook (0.5, 0.45, 0.35, 0.5).  The absence of other significant news or financial data in the provided headline and content further supports a neutral-to-slightly negative outlook. Considering the overall sentiment from previous predictions and the limited information in the current news, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, but the impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc.

Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of actionable or impactful information in the news, the probabilities are estimated to be neutral, with a slight tilt towards a fall due to the general uncertainty in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically suggests that the analyst expects the stock to perform worse than the market or its peers. This rating is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, considering the overall market sentiment, Apple's strong business model, and the potential for the company to adapt and grow, the impact of this single rating might be limited. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, with some predicting a higher chance of the stock price falling and others seeing a more balanced or slightly positive outlook. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to the negative sentiment associated with the underperform rating, but not a certainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a little-known AI stock. This action may be perceived as a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, considering the diverse portfolio and strong market presence of Apple, the impact of this news is likely to be minimal. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of slightly higher probabilities of the stock price falling due to the negative sentiment associated with a prominent investor selling shares. Given this context and the overall market sentiment, the estimated probabilities of the stock price movement are provided.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, coupled with concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features not resonating with consumers. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. Several previous predictions indicate a consensus that the stock is likely to face downward pressure due to this news. Although there is still value in the services segment, the overall market reaction is likely to be negative.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple Inc. highlights a mixed sentiment ahead of its earnings report, with concerns about its performance related to its AI strategy and challenges in China.

While the article mentions Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it also highlights that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding and a significant source of dividend income ($300 million in 2025). The article suggests Apple might increase its dividend, which is a positive signal. However, it also mentions Buffett *could* sell more stock. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a fall due to negative news, while others predicted a rise due to Buffett's continued holding and potential dividend increase. The current news is mildly positive, highlighting Apple's importance in Berkshire's portfolio and the potential for increased dividends. However, the possibility of Buffett selling more shares introduces some uncertainty. Given this context and the previous predictions, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a more balanced view, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the dividend income and potential increase, but acknowledging the risk of Buffett selling shares.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news about Steven Cohen selling Apple stock and buying an AI stock is the most prominent piece of information. While this is noteworthy, it's not definitive.  Cohen's reasons are unknown, and his actions don't guarantee a market trend.  The lack of specifics (sale volume, Cohen's rationale) weakens the impact.  Previous predictions show a consistent leaning towards a price fall (averaging around 0.6), primarily due to concerns about iPhone shipments, AI feature reception, and analyst downgrades.  While some models highlight positive aspects like Apple's strong services revenue and potential dividend increases, the negative sentiment outweighs the positives in the provided information.  The overall consensus from multiple models across rounds suggests a higher likelihood of a price fall, although the magnitude of the fall is uncertain.  Therefore, I'm weighting the probability of a fall higher, considering the cumulative negative sentiment and lack of strong countervailing positive news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc.

This rating, coupled with potential revenue misses and a decline in stock value, presents significant near-term risks. However, Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue provide a buffer against a drastic fall. Given the mixed sentiment and the influence of other market factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his Apple stock and invested in a little-known AI stock, which may be perceived as a lack of confidence in Apple's future prospects.

Balancing these factors, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  Steven Cohen selling Apple stock is negative, suggesting a potential loss of confidence from a prominent investor. However, the lack of detail regarding the sale volume limits the impact.  The mention of Cohen buying an AI stock is a distraction.  Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 across multiple models and rounds.  This consensus leans heavily on concerns about iPhone shipments, AI feature reception, and analyst downgrades. While some models point to positive factors like Apple's strong services revenue and potential dividend increases, the negative sentiment consistently outweighs these positives in the available information.  Therefore, I'm weighting the probability of a fall higher, reflecting the cumulative negative sentiment and lack of strong countervailing positive news, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolution of mega-cap stock acronyms, including Apple Inc.
