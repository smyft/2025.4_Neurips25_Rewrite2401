If Apple is one of the 'unstoppable stocks' mentioned, it could see a positive impact on its stock price. However, without explicit mention of Apple in the context of Buffett's portfolio, the impact is less certain. Given Buffett's reputation, there is a higher probability of a stock price rise due to positive sentiment, but the lack of direct mention reduces the certainty. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a rise than a fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}"
