On one hand, a ban on TikTok may lead to increased usage of alternative social media platforms, which could benefit Apple if users turn to apps that are more integrated with iOS. On the other hand, if the ban raises concerns about regulatory scrutiny or impacts consumer sentiment negatively, it could lead to a decline in stock price. Overall, the direct impact on Apple is uncertain, but the potential for increased app usage could slightly favor a rise in stock price.
