(AAPL), but does not explicitly state that Apple is one of the 9 unstoppable stocks. However, given Warren Buffett's reputation and influence as a successful investor, any positive news about his portfolio can have a positive impact on the stock prices of the companies he invests in. Since Apple is a well-established company with a strong track record, if it is indeed one of the 9 unstoppable stocks, it could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive up the stock price.
