Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed and respected, suggesting strong confidence in these companies. This positive sentiment typically leads to increased investor interest and potential buying pressure. However, the news is somewhat vague as it doesn't explicitly name Apple, but given Apple's prominence in Buffett's portfolio, it's a reasonable assumption. The impact is likely to be moderate as this is more of a reaffirmation of existing investment rather than a new development. Therefore, a slightly higher probability of a rise is assigned.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
