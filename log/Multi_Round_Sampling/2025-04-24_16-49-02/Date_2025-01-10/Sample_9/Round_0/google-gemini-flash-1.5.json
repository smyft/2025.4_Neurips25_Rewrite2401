While this is positive sentiment, the news lacks specifics about Apple's weighting within that portfolio or any new investment in Apple.  The timeframe of 2025 is also quite far out, making any prediction based solely on this headline highly speculative.  The overall market conditions and Apple's own performance will be far more influential on its stock price than this general statement. Therefore, the probability of a price rise due to this news alone is low, and the probability of a fall is also low, as the news is not inherently negative. The most likely scenario is that the news has minimal impact on the stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.1,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.1\n}\n```\n"
