(AAPL) operates the App Store, where TikTok is distributed. A ban on TikTok could lead to a temporary decrease in App Store revenue due to the loss of a popular app. However, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance is likely to be minimal, as TikTok is just one of many apps in the App Store. Additionally, the news does not directly affect Apple's core business of hardware sales.
