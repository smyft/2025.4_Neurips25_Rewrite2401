While the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple, it implies that Apple is likely one of these dominant AI stocks, given its market capitalization and AI initiatives. This concentration could be interpreted in two ways: positive, as it signals strong investor confidence in these AI leaders, or negative, as it suggests potential vulnerability if the AI sector faces headwinds. However, the overall tone leans positive, suggesting that these companies are driving market performance. Therefore, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple, assuming it's perceived as a key player in the AI space.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 28.8% of the Entire S&P 500 Index\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
