The headline mentions 'The Best (and Only) Dow Jones ETF', which does not provide any direct positive or negative news about Apple Inc. Since Apple Inc. is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, any news about Dow Jones ETFs could have a minor indirect impact. However, without specific information about Apple's performance, products, or financials, the impact is likely to be minimal.
