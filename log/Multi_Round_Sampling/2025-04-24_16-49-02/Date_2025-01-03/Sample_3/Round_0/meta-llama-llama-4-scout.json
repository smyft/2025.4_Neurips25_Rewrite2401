(AAPL) as one of these stocks. However, Apple is known for its significant investments and integration of AI technologies in its products. The lack of direct mention does not necessarily imply a negative impact on Apple's stock, as the company's AI contributions are already well-established. Given that AI is a growing field and Apple is a major player, the overall sentiment could be slightly positive by association. However, without direct relevance to Apple's current stock performance or future outlook, the impact is likely to be neutral or mildly positive due to the general positive perception of AI stocks.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 28.8% of the Entire S&P 500 Index\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
