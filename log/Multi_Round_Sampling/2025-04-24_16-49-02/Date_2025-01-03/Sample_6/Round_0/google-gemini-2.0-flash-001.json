While Apple is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the headline doesn't directly mention any positive or negative developments related to Apple's business, products, or financial performance. The impact on Apple's stock price is therefore likely to be minimal. The headline suggests a general discussion about the Dow Jones ETF itself, rather than anything specific to Apple.
