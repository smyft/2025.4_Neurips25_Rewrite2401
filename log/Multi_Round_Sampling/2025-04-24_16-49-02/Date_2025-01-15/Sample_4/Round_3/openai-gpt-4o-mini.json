(AAPL)\nNews Headline: The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now\nNews Content: Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, which could indicate some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's foray into AI could be a positive catalyst for future growth, but the current sentiment appears mixed. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to the overall positive framing, despite the concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is explicitly negative. Without the actual content of the article, it's impossible to provide a precise probability. However, the headline strongly suggests a negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise. I'm assuming the article provides reasons for a potential decline, which would further reinforce this negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is likely to have a limited impact on Apple's stock price. While the partnership's termination could cause short-term disruption to Apple Card features and potentially impact user experience, the article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and maintain its ecosystem.  Goldman Sachs' struggles with the Apple Card are primarily their problem, not Apple's. Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected. The potential for a smooth transition with a new partner minimizes the risk of significant negative impact on Apple's stock.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the impact is likely to be relatively small given the overall strength of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's prudent use of debt, highlighting that its net debt is relatively low at US$41.5b compared to its massive market capitalization of US$3.51t. The article emphasizes that Apple has a strong ability to cover its interest expenses, with an EBIT covering interest 673 times over, and a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31. Additionally, Apple's free cash flow is robust, amounting to 90% of its EBIT, which positions it well to manage its debt. The overall tone of the article is positive, suggesting that Apple's financial health is strong and its use of debt is conservative and strategic. This positive sentiment is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article mentions that Buffett and his lieutenants have been paring back their stake in Apple, it also highlights Apple's potential for significant and prolonged growth, particularly with its advancements in AI technology. The article presents a neutral to positive view of Apple's prospects, emphasizing its status as a 'timeless stalwart' with a strong reputation for performance. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake could be perceived as a negative signal. Overall, the article's tone suggests a slightly positive outlook on Apple's stock, but with cautious consideration of the recent stake reduction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price rising, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance, which is likely to cause investor concern. Such headlines typically lead to selling pressure on the stock as investors adjust their expectations and positions. Given the negative sentiment expressed in the headline, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, which suggests a level of confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also mentions recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, indicating some caution among investors. The potential for growth in AI technology is a positive factor, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the concerns raised. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the positive framing of Apple's prospects despite the cautionary notes.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline is explicitly negative: \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year.\" This suggests a high likelihood of a stock price decrease. While some models in Round 0 attempted to find positive angles or downplay the impact, the headline's directness is a strong indicator of negative sentiment. The majority of models in Round 0 predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some assigning probabilities as high as 0.8. Given the consistent negative framing, I will align with the more pessimistic predictions from the previous round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is a relatively minor event for Apple in the long term. While there might be short-term market reaction due to uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected.  The article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and find a new partner, minimizing the risk of significant negative impact.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models emphasizing the potential negative impact (0.2 rise, 0.8 fall) and others highlighting Apple's resilience (0.6 rise, 0.4 fall).  Considering Apple's overall market position and history of successfully navigating challenges, the probability of a stock price fall is likely to be lower than the probability of a rise, although the impact is likely to be relatively small. The fact that a potential replacement (JPMorgan Chase) is already mentioned further mitigates the risk.  The overall sentiment leans slightly positive, but the impact is likely to be muted given the scale of Apple's operations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a detailed analysis of Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative use of debt, strong financial health, and robust free cash flow. The article emphasizes Apple's ability to cover interest expenses with an EBIT covering interest 673 times over and a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31. Additionally, Apple's free cash flow is strong, amounting to 90% of its EBIT, which positions it well to manage its debt. The overall tone of the article is positive, suggesting that Apple's financial health is strong and its use of debt is strategic. This positive sentiment is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook, and the strong financial indicators presented in the news, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential.

Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to the overall positive framing, despite the concerns raised.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products.

Several previous predictions indicate a mix of opinions with a slight bias towards caution. While some predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive aspects like strong financial health and innovative capabilities, others emphasize the negative sentiment from the headline and potential disruptions. Considering the latest negative headline and historical trends of similar sentiments, it is reasonable to lean more towards the negative outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also mentions recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, indicating some caution among investors. The potential for growth in AI technology is a positive factor, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the concerns raised. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the positive framing of Apple's prospects despite the cautionary notes.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is undeniably negative and should be the primary driver of the prediction. While some previous rounds attempted to find positive angles or downplay the impact, the directness of the headline suggests a high likelihood of a stock price decrease. The majority of models in previous rounds predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some assigning probabilities as high as 0.8. Given the consistent negative framing, I will align with the more pessimistic predictions from the previous round and slightly increase the probability of a fall due to the consistency of the negative headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from the Apple Card partnership is a relatively minor event for Apple, given its overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio. While there's potential for short-term market volatility due to uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, the impact is unlikely to be significant.  Apple's ability to find a new partner (JPMorgan Chase is mentioned) mitigates the risk.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting Apple's resilience and strong core business.  The negative sentiment expressed in some headlines is not directly related to the core Apple business and is likely to be overshadowed by the company's overall positive outlook.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise, acknowledging the potential for short-term fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a detailed analysis of Apple's conservative use of debt, highlighting its strong financial health, robust free cash flow, and ability to cover interest expenses with an EBIT covering interest 673 times over.
