(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, which could indicate some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's foray into AI could be a positive catalyst for future growth, but the current sentiment appears mixed. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to the overall positive framing, despite the concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is explicitly negative. Without the actual content of the article, it's impossible to provide a precise probability. However, the headline strongly suggests a negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise. I'm assuming the article provides reasons for a potential decline, which would further reinforce this negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is likely to have a limited impact on Apple's stock price. While the partnership's termination could cause short-term disruption to Apple Card features and potentially impact user experience, the article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and maintain its ecosystem.  Goldman Sachs' struggles with the Apple Card are primarily their problem, not Apple's. Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected. The potential for a smooth transition with a new partner minimizes the risk of significant negative impact on Apple's stock.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the impact is likely to be relatively small given the overall strength of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's prudent use of debt, highlighting that its net debt is relatively low at US$41.5b compared to its massive market capitalization of US$3.51t. The article emphasizes that Apple has a strong ability to cover its interest expenses, with an EBIT covering interest 673 times over, and a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31. Additionally, Apple's free cash flow is robust, amounting to 90% of its EBIT, which positions it well to manage its debt. The overall tone of the article is positive, suggesting that Apple's financial health is strong and its use of debt is conservative and strategic. This positive sentiment is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article mentions that Buffett and his lieutenants have been paring back their stake in Apple, it also highlights Apple's potential for significant and prolonged growth, particularly with its advancements in AI technology. The article presents a neutral to positive view of Apple's prospects, emphasizing its status as a 'timeless stalwart' with a strong reputation for performance. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake could be perceived as a negative signal. Overall, the article's tone suggests a slightly positive outlook on Apple's stock, but with cautious consideration of the recent stake reduction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price rising, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance, which is likely to cause investor concern. Such headlines typically lead to selling pressure on the stock as investors adjust their expectations and positions. Given the negative sentiment expressed in the headline, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, which suggests a level of confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also mentions recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, indicating some caution among investors. The potential for growth in AI technology is a positive factor, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the concerns raised. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the positive framing of Apple's prospects despite the cautionary notes.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline is explicitly negative: \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year.\" This suggests a high likelihood of a stock price decrease. While some models in Round 0 attempted to find positive angles or downplay the impact, the headline's directness is a strong indicator of negative sentiment. The majority of models in Round 0 predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some assigning probabilities as high as 0.8. Given the consistent negative framing, I will align with the more pessimistic predictions from the previous round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is a relatively minor event for Apple in the long term. While there might be short-term market reaction due to uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected.  The article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and find a new partner, minimizing the risk of significant negative impact.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models emphasizing the potential negative impact (0.2 rise, 0.8 fall) and others highlighting Apple's resilience (0.6 rise, 0.4 fall).  Considering Apple's overall market position and history of successfully navigating challenges, the probability of a stock price fall is likely to be lower than the probability of a rise, although the impact is likely to be relatively small. The fact that a potential replacement (JPMorgan Chase) is already mentioned further mitigates the risk.  The overall sentiment leans slightly positive, but the impact is likely to be muted given the scale of Apple's operations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a detailed analysis of Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative use of debt, strong financial health, and robust free cash flow. The article emphasizes Apple's ability to cover interest expenses with an EBIT covering interest 673 times over and a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31. Additionally, Apple's free cash flow is strong, amounting to 90% of its EBIT, which positions it well to manage its debt. The overall tone of the article is positive, suggesting that Apple's financial health is strong and its use of debt is strategic. This positive sentiment is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook, and the strong financial indicators presented in the news, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential.

Several previous predictions indicate a mix of opinions with a slight bias towards caution. While some predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive aspects like strong financial health and innovative capabilities, others emphasize the negative sentiment from the headline and potential disruptions. Considering the latest negative headline and historical trends of similar sentiments, it is reasonable to lean more towards the negative outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also mentions recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, indicating some caution among investors. The potential for growth in AI technology is a positive factor, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the concerns raised. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the positive framing of Apple's prospects despite the cautionary notes.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is undeniably negative and should be the primary driver of the prediction. While some previous rounds attempted to find positive angles or downplay the impact, the directness of the headline suggests a high likelihood of a stock price decrease. The majority of models in previous rounds predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some assigning probabilities as high as 0.8. Given the consistent negative framing, I will align with the more pessimistic predictions from the previous round and slightly increase the probability of a fall due to the consistency of the negative headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from the Apple Card partnership is a relatively minor event for Apple, given its overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio. While there's potential for short-term market volatility due to uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, the impact is unlikely to be significant.  Apple's ability to find a new partner (JPMorgan Chase is mentioned) mitigates the risk.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting Apple's resilience and strong core business.  The negative sentiment expressed in some headlines is not directly related to the core Apple business and is likely to be overshadowed by the company's overall positive outlook.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise, acknowledging the potential for short-term fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a detailed analysis of Apple's conservative use of debt, highlighting its strong financial health, robust free cash flow, and ability to cover interest expenses with an EBIT covering interest 673 times over.
