(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks that are expected to show solid earnings growth. The mention of higher bond yields and the potential for fewer Fed rate cuts may create a cautious sentiment around tech stocks, including Apple. Additionally, Apple has already seen a decline of 8% year-to-date, which may indicate a bearish trend. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling as investors may seek safer, more stable investments in the current environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple carries a significant amount of debt, its net debt is manageable due to its large cash reserves. The article emphasizes Apple's low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and strong free cash flow generation, indicating a healthy financial position and ability to easily meet its debt obligations. The article also mentions a slight increase in EBIT, further easing debt repayment concerns. Overall, the article suggests that Apple's debt is not a significant risk and may even be used strategically to boost returns. This positive assessment of Apple's financial health is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a slight increase in the stock price. However, the article also mentions two warning signs in their investment analysis, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is likely to have a limited impact on Apple's stock price. While the partnership's termination could cause short-term disruption to Apple Card features and potentially impact user experience, the article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and maintain its ecosystem.  Goldman Sachs' struggles with the Apple Card are primarily their problem, not Apple's. Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected. The potential for a smooth transition with a new partner minimizes the risk of significant negative impact on Apple's stock.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the impact is likely to be relatively small given the overall strength of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, indicating potential downward pressure. However, without specific details from the news content, the analysis is limited to the sentiment of the headline. Negative headlines can influence investor sentiment and lead to a short-term decline in stock price. Given the lack of concrete data or reasons provided in the headline alone, the probabilities are estimated based on general market behavior to negative sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty regarding the future of Apple's financial products, such as the Apple Card and Savings. While this development could disrupt these services and potentially impact user experience, Apple's strong track record of innovation and customer retention suggests a likely smooth transition. The impact on Apple's stock price is therefore likely to be neutral or slightly negative in the short term due to the uncertainty, but the company's robust ecosystem and history of successful pivots mitigate the long-term risk. For Goldman Sachs, the decision to exit is driven by financial losses and regulatory issues, which might not directly impact Apple's stock but could influence investor perception of Apple's financial partnerships.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article cites BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Gargi Chaudhuri, who expects the 493 other stocks to post an 11% earnings growth this year, faster than the 8% growth in 2024. Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024. This slowdown, combined with the potential for other sectors to outperform, may lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price. Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple's stock is already down 8% year-to-date, which could indicate a negative trend. Therefore, based on this analysis, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks that are expected to show solid earnings growth. The mention of higher bond yields and the potential for fewer Fed rate cuts creates a cautious sentiment around tech stocks, including Apple. Additionally, the article indicates that while the Magnificent Seven, including Apple, are expected to see earnings growth, it is slowing down compared to previous years. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling as investors may seek safer, more stable investments in the current environment, especially with Apple's year-to-date decline of 8%.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative use of debt and strong financial health. Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest that Apple is well-positioned to manage its debt obligations. The article also notes a recent increase in EBIT, further supporting the company's ability to repay debt. While the article mentions two warning signs in their investment analysis, the overall tone is reassuring regarding Apple's financial stability. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the positive sentiment around Apple's debt management should outweigh the negative concerns. Therefore, I predict a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from the Apple Card partnership presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While it introduces uncertainty and potential short-term disruption to Apple Card features, the impact on Apple's overall business is likely to be limited. Apple's core business remains strong, and its ability to find a new partner and maintain its ecosystem mitigates the risk of significant negative consequences.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price drop due to broader market trends or concerns about the 'Magnificent Seven', while others are more optimistic about Apple's resilience.  Considering the relatively minor nature of the news in the context of Apple's overall financial health and the potential for a smooth transition, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be small. The fact that Goldman Sachs' issues are primarily their own and not directly reflective of Apple's performance is a key factor in this assessment.  The previous predictions' varied reasoning and outcomes further support a neutral-to-slightly negative outlook, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Given the mixed signals from previous predictions and the negative sentiment of the news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year', it appears there is a cautious outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The headline suggests potential downward pressure, which aligns with some models predicting higher probabilities of the stock price falling (e.g., 0.65, 0.7). However, other models highlight Apple's strong financial position and ability to manage disruptions, suggesting a more balanced or slightly positive outlook (e.g., 0.55, 0.6). Considering the overall trend and the headline's negative tone, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising, but not overwhelmingly so due to Apple's resilient fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early could introduce short-term uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial products like the Apple Card and Savings. However, considering Apple's strong track record of innovation, customer retention, and its ability to manage transitions smoothly, the long-term impact is likely to be minimal. The partnership's termination is more of a reflection of Goldman Sachs' financial struggles and regulatory issues rather than a direct negative impact on Apple's core business, which remains strong and unaffected. Therefore, while there might be some short-term volatility, the overall probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to the resilience of Apple's ecosystem and its historical ability to handle such changes effectively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc.

Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple's stock is already down 8% year-to-date, which could indicate a negative trend. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a general consensus that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. Therefore, based on this analysis, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.4 and the estimated probability of the stock price falling is 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to debt management, emphasizing its strong cash reserves and manageable net debt levels. The company's low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage suggest a low risk profile, which should be seen positively by investors. Additionally, the article mentions increasing EBIT and robust free cash flow generation, further reinforcing the company's financial health. Although the news mentions two warning signs, the overall tone of the article is positive, suggesting that Apple's debt management strategy is viewed favorably by the market.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
