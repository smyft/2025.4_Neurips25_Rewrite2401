(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, which could indicate some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's foray into AI could be a positive catalyst for future growth, but the current sentiment appears mixed. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to the overall positive framing, but with significant caution due to the recent performance issues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is explicitly negative. While the actual content of the article is missing, the headline itself strongly suggests a potential downturn in Apple's stock price. Without the article's specifics, it's impossible to quantify the impact precisely, but the headline's direct warning warrants a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase. I am assuming the article provides valid reasons for the stock to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership, highlighting Goldman's financial losses and regulatory issues with the venture. While this might initially seem negative for Apple, the article suggests Apple is likely to find a replacement partner and maintain the functionality of its financial services.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted because: 1) Apple's core business is not directly tied to the Apple Card's profitability; 2) Apple has a strong track record of adapting to changes; 3) the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's.  A partner change might cause temporary uncertainty, but Apple's overall financial health and brand strength are unlikely to be significantly affected. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of the company's innovation post-Steve Jobs and its integration worldwide with Apple devices. However, the article also mentions mixed performance in the AI era and concerns about iPhone sales momentum. Cramer's comments are somewhat supportive, but the broader context includes uncertainty about Apple's ability to sustain growth and innovation, which could influence investor sentiment. Overall, the news is neutral with a slight positive tilt due to Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors may be shifting their focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and towards other S&P 500 stocks that could offer better growth and valuation opportunities. The article highlights that the Mag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, which is a slowdown from their 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, the rising bond yields, particularly with 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5%, have rattled investors in these high-growth tech stocks. However, Apple's specific prospects are not directly criticized in the article, but the overall sentiment seems to favor diversification and exploring other sectors beyond tech, which could lead to a relatively negative outlook for AAPL in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price rising, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a cautious approach towards using debt, maintaining a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests a financially stable company with a low risk profile. Moreover, Apple's free cash flow generation is robust, which supports its ability to manage debt if needed. These factors suggest positive investor sentiment and potential stock price appreciation.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
