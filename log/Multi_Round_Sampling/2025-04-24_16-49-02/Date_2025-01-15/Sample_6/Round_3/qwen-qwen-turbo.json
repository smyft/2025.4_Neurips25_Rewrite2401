(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, which could indicate some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's foray into AI could be a positive catalyst for future growth, but the current sentiment appears mixed. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to the overall positive framing, but with significant caution due to the recent performance issues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is explicitly negative. While the actual content of the article is missing, the headline itself strongly suggests a potential downturn in Apple's stock price. Without the article's specifics, it's impossible to quantify the impact precisely, but the headline's direct warning warrants a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase. I am assuming the article provides valid reasons for the stock to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership, highlighting Goldman's financial losses and regulatory issues with the venture. While this might initially seem negative for Apple, the article suggests Apple is likely to find a replacement partner and maintain the functionality of its financial services.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted because: 1) Apple's core business is not directly tied to the Apple Card's profitability; 2) Apple has a strong track record of adapting to changes; 3) the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's.  A partner change might cause temporary uncertainty, but Apple's overall financial health and brand strength are unlikely to be significantly affected. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of the company's innovation post-Steve Jobs and its integration worldwide with Apple devices. However, the article also mentions mixed performance in the AI era and concerns about iPhone sales momentum. Cramer's comments are somewhat supportive, but the broader context includes uncertainty about Apple's ability to sustain growth and innovation, which could influence investor sentiment. Overall, the news is neutral with a slight positive tilt due to Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors may be shifting their focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and towards other S&P 500 stocks that could offer better growth and valuation opportunities. The article highlights that the Mag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, which is a slowdown from their 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, the rising bond yields, particularly with 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5%, have rattled investors in these high-growth tech stocks. However, Apple's specific prospects are not directly criticized in the article, but the overall sentiment seems to favor diversification and exploring other sectors beyond tech, which could lead to a relatively negative outlook for AAPL in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price rising, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a cautious approach towards using debt, maintaining a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests a financially stable company with a low risk profile. Moreover, Apple's free cash flow generation is robust, which supports its ability to manage debt if needed. These factors suggest positive investor sentiment and potential stock price appreciation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, which generally suggests confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, indicating some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's efforts in AI could serve as a positive catalyst for future growth, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the company's recent performance issues. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but with significant caution reflected in the probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The initial headline is negative, suggesting a potential downturn. However, the round 0 predictions are mixed, with some models leaning towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and potential for innovation, while others predict a fall due to market shifts and specific concerns like the Goldman Sachs partnership. The distribution of predictions in round 0 is quite varied, indicating uncertainty. Considering the negative headline and the mixed signals from the previous predictions, I will slightly favor a fall, but not overwhelmingly, as Apple is a resilient company. The negative headline is a strong signal, but the diverse opinions in round 0 suggest that the market's reaction might not be uniformly negative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership is largely negative for Goldman Sachs, but its impact on Apple is likely to be minimal. While there might be short-term uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong brand, ecosystem, and ability to find a new partner (potentially JPMorgan Chase) mitigate the risk.  The news focuses on Goldman's financial struggles, not Apple's core business strength.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 probability of a price rise. Considering the relatively minor impact on Apple's overall business and its history of successfully navigating such changes, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is warranted. The market's reaction is likely to be muted, with the probability of a price rise slightly higher than a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

Cramer's comments are somewhat supportive, but the broader context includes uncertainty about Apple's ability to sustain growth and innovation, which could influence investor sentiment. The previous predictions show a mix of slightly positive to neutral outlooks, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Apple's strong financials and potential for AI integration. Overall, the news is neutral with a slight positive tilt due to Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation and the company's robust financial position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

The news also points out that Apple has robust free cash flow, which further supports its financial stability. These factors suggest that the company is in a strong financial position, reducing risk and potentially increasing investor confidence. Although previous predictions have shown mixed sentiments, the overall positive framing of Apple's financial health and its ability to manage debt effectively indicates a lower risk and more stable stock performance.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, which generally suggests confidence in its long-term potential.

While the content is missing, the headline's direct warning suggests a higher probability of a price decrease. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and potential for innovation, while others predict a fall due to market shifts and specific concerns. The distribution of predictions in round 1 is still varied, indicating uncertainty.

The negative headline is a strong signal, but the diverse opinions in previous rounds suggest that the market's reaction might not be uniformly negative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership is primarily negative for Goldman Sachs, but its impact on Apple is likely to be relatively minor and short-lived.  While there's potential for short-term uncertainty and minor disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong brand, vast ecosystem, and ability to secure a new partner (potentially JPMorgan Chase) mitigate the risk significantly.  The core Apple business remains unaffected.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models lean towards a muted impact on Apple's stock price, with a slight bias towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and resilience.  The fact that the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's, further supports a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  Considering the limited direct impact on Apple's financials and its history of successfully navigating similar situations, a price rise is slightly more likely than a fall. However, the uncertainty introduced by the partnership change warrants a probability less than 0.6 for a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

The overall sentiment seems to favor diversification and exploring other sectors beyond tech, which could lead to a relatively neutral to slightly negative outlook for AAPL in the short term. Considering the mixed sentiment and the current market trends, and taking into account the previous predictions which show a varied but generally cautious outlook, I estimate a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products.
