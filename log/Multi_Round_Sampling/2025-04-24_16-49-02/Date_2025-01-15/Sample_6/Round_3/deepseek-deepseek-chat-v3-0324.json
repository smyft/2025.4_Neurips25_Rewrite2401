(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, which could indicate some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's foray into AI could be a positive catalyst for future growth, but the current sentiment appears mixed. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to the overall positive framing, but with significant caution due to the recent performance issues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is explicitly negative. While the actual content of the article is missing, the headline itself strongly suggests a potential downturn in Apple's stock price. Without the article's specifics, it's impossible to quantify the impact precisely, but the headline's direct warning warrants a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase. I am assuming the article provides valid reasons for the stock to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership, highlighting Goldman's financial losses and regulatory issues with the venture. While this might initially seem negative for Apple, the article suggests Apple is likely to find a replacement partner and maintain the functionality of its financial services.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted because: 1) Apple's core business is not directly tied to the Apple Card's profitability; 2) Apple has a strong track record of adapting to changes; 3) the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's.  A partner change might cause temporary uncertainty, but Apple's overall financial health and brand strength are unlikely to be significantly affected. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of the company's innovation post-Steve Jobs and its integration worldwide with Apple devices. However, the article also mentions mixed performance in the AI era and concerns about iPhone sales momentum. Cramer's comments are somewhat supportive, but the broader context includes uncertainty about Apple's ability to sustain growth and innovation, which could influence investor sentiment. Overall, the news is neutral with a slight positive tilt due to Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors may be shifting their focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and towards other S&P 500 stocks that could offer better growth and valuation opportunities. The article highlights that the Mag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, which is a slowdown from their 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, the rising bond yields, particularly with 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5%, have rattled investors in these high-growth tech stocks. However, Apple's specific prospects are not directly criticized in the article, but the overall sentiment seems to favor diversification and exploring other sectors beyond tech, which could lead to a relatively negative outlook for AAPL in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price rising, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a cautious approach towards using debt, maintaining a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests a financially stable company with a low risk profile. Moreover, Apple's free cash flow generation is robust, which supports its ability to manage debt if needed. These factors suggest positive investor sentiment and potential stock price appreciation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, which generally suggests confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, indicating some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's efforts in AI could serve as a positive catalyst for future growth, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the company's recent performance issues. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but with significant caution reflected in the probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The initial headline is negative, suggesting a potential downturn. However, the round 0 predictions are mixed, with some models leaning towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and potential for innovation, while others predict a fall due to market shifts and specific concerns like the Goldman Sachs partnership. The distribution of predictions in round 0 is quite varied, indicating uncertainty. Considering the negative headline and the mixed signals from the previous predictions, I will slightly favor a fall, but not overwhelmingly, as Apple is a resilient company. The negative headline is a strong signal, but the diverse opinions in round 0 suggest that the market's reaction might not be uniformly negative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership is largely negative for Goldman Sachs, but its impact on Apple is likely to be minimal. While there might be short-term uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong brand, ecosystem, and ability to find a new partner (potentially JPMorgan Chase) mitigate the risk.  The news focuses on Goldman's financial struggles, not Apple's core business strength.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 probability of a price rise. Considering the relatively minor impact on Apple's overall business and its history of successfully navigating such changes, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is warranted. The market's reaction is likely to be muted, with the probability of a price rise slightly higher than a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of the company's innovation post-Steve Jobs and its integration worldwide with Apple devices. However, the article also mentions mixed performance in the AI era and concerns about iPhone sales momentum. Cramer's comments are somewhat supportive, but the broader context includes uncertainty about Apple's ability to sustain growth and innovation, which could influence investor sentiment. The previous predictions show a mix of slightly positive to neutral outlooks, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Apple's strong financials and potential for AI integration. Overall, the news is neutral with a slight positive tilt due to Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation and the company's robust financial position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

Considering the mixed sentiment and the current market trends, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models agree that the impact on Apple's stock price will be muted. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price rising, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative approach to debt management, noting that it has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. The news also points out that Apple has robust free cash flow, which further supports its financial stability. These factors suggest that the company is in a strong financial position, reducing risk and potentially increasing investor confidence. Although previous predictions have shown mixed sentiments, the overall positive framing of Apple's financial health and its ability to manage debt effectively indicates a lower risk and more stable stock performance.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, which generally suggests confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, indicating some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's efforts in AI could serve as a positive catalyst for future growth, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the company's recent performance issues. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but with significant caution reflected in the probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\" is inherently negative. While the content is missing, the headline's direct warning suggests a higher probability of a price decrease. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and potential for innovation, while others predict a fall due to market shifts and specific concerns. The distribution of predictions in round 1 is still varied, indicating uncertainty. Considering the negative headline and the mixed signals from the previous predictions, I will slightly favor a fall, but not overwhelmingly, as Apple is a resilient company. The negative headline is a strong signal, but the diverse opinions in previous rounds suggest that the market's reaction might not be uniformly negative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership is primarily negative for Goldman Sachs, but its impact on Apple is likely to be relatively minor and short-lived.  While there's potential for short-term uncertainty and minor disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong brand, vast ecosystem, and ability to secure a new partner (potentially JPMorgan Chase) mitigate the risk significantly.  The core Apple business remains unaffected.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models lean towards a muted impact on Apple's stock price, with a slight bias towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and resilience.  The fact that the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's, further supports a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  Considering the limited direct impact on Apple's financials and its history of successfully navigating similar situations, a price rise is slightly more likely than a fall. However, the uncertainty introduced by the partnership change warrants a probability less than 0.6 for a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

The overall sentiment seems to favor diversification and exploring other sectors beyond tech, which could lead to a relatively neutral to slightly negative outlook for AAPL in the short term. Considering the mixed sentiment and the current market trends, and taking into account the previous predictions which show a varied but generally cautious outlook, I estimate a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products.
