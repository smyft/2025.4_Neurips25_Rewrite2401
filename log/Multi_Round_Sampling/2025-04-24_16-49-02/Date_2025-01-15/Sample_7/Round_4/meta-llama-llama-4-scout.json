(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, which could indicate some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's foray into AI could be a positive catalyst for future growth, but the current market sentiment may be mixed due to the recent performance. Overall, the probabilities reflect a slight edge towards a price rise due to the positive framing of Apple as a Buffett stock, despite the concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. While the overall market outlook might be positive, the article specifically highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date. The article suggests that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down, and investors may not be anticipating this change. This could lead to a further decrease in investor interest in Apple, potentially driving its stock price down. The article also mentions rising bond yields negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. The article does not mention any specific positive catalysts for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple's innovation and its position within the broader market context.  Cramer's dismissal of the claim that Apple's innovation has stagnated since Steve Jobs' death is mildly positive for Apple. However, the article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks and suggests that other companies might offer better returns in the short term.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly positive regarding Apple, but not overwhelmingly so. The broader market context discussed (inflation, bond market behavior) is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific stock movement in response to this news. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is slightly higher than the probability of a price decrease, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's recommended stocks, highlighting its timeless reputation and potential growth in the AI sector despite recent stagnant revenue and Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake. The article suggests that Apple's new AI-powered tools and development of AI data center chips could position it for future growth. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake and stagnant iPhone sales may weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the positive outlook on AI and Apple's strong brand may outweigh the negatives, but the impact is likely moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for stocks outside of the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7) to perform well, citing expectations of 11% earnings growth for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500. It also mentions that the Mag7, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL), is expected to see a slowdown in earnings growth. Specifically, AAPL is noted to be down 8% year to date. The article suggests that investors may be overly focused on the Mag7 and that there are good investing opportunities in other sectors, such as financials. The overall tone implies a cautious or negative outlook for the Mag7, including AAPL, in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline typically indicates potential challenges or downward trends that could affect the company's stock price. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. However, without specific details on the reasons behind the potential decline, the exact probabilities are speculative. Generally, such headlines can lead to investor caution or selling, which would decrease the stock price. Yet, the market's reaction can be unpredictable and depends on various factors including the company's overall performance, industry trends, and broader economic conditions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a cautious approach towards using debt, maintaining a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests a financially stable position which is generally viewed positively by investors. The company's ability to generate robust free cash flow further supports its financial health. While it carries some debt, it is managed effectively, and there are no immediate signs of financial risk.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which generally instills confidence among investors. However, it also points out recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which may raise concerns. The mention of Apple's potential growth in the AI sector could serve as a positive catalyst, but the overall sentiment appears mixed due to the company's recent performance. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with significant caution due to the negative indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. It highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date and that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down. Rising bond yields are also mentioned as negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. Considering the negative aspects highlighted in the news and the trend of some models predicting a fall, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple and the broader market. Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation is mildly positive, but his preference for AI stocks and the overall market context (inflation, bond yields) are largely neutral to slightly negative for Apple.  The article doesn't present any strong bullish or bearish catalysts specific to Apple.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion. Some models highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and potential in AI, while others emphasize concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus.  The lack of a significant positive or negative catalyst in this news, coupled with the mixed predictions from other models, suggests a relatively neutral outlook.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a price rise, reflecting the mildly positive sentiment from Cramer's comments, but acknowledging the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a timeless stalwart with a strong reputation, its foray into AI with new tools and chip development, and its position as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. These factors could attract investor interest and support a price rise. On the negative side, the article notes stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, which could signal caution and potentially lead to a price fall. The overall tone is balanced but leans slightly positive due to the long-term growth potential in AI. Considering the previous predictions, which also show a mix of opinions but with a slight tilt towards a rise, the probability of a price rise is marginally higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, with expectations of 11% earnings growth for the 493 stocks outside of the Mag7. It also mentions that Apple's growth is expected to slow down, and the stock has already experienced an 8% decline year-to-date. Additionally, rising bond yields have negatively impacted the Mag7 names, including Apple. However, the overall tone does not explicitly predict a stock price fall but rather highlights a cautious outlook for Apple and the Mag7. Given this context, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be lower than that of a fall, reflecting a cautious or negative outlook for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a strongly negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline typically indicates potential challenges or downward trends that could affect the company's stock price. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising. The previous predictions from other models also show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models citing specific reasons such as the potential slowdown in earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' and Apple's recent underperformance. However, it's worth noting that some models had slightly different interpretations based on different news content, but the current headline's negative tone is a strong indicator of potential decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative approach to debt management, noting a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests financial stability and effective debt management, which are generally viewed positively by investors. The company's robust free cash flow generation further reinforces its financial health. While it has some debt, it is managed well, and there are no immediate signs of financial risk. These factors contribute to a positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which generally instills confidence among investors. However, it also points out recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which may raise concerns. The mention of Apple's potential growth in the AI sector could serve as a positive catalyst, but the overall sentiment appears mixed due to the company's recent performance. Considering the previous predictions, there is a slight tilt towards a price rise due to the positive framing of Apple as a Buffett stock, despite the concerns raised about its recent performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks.

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. However, the trend seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook for Apple. Therefore, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect this increased probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's comments on Apple and the broader market.  While Cramer defends Apple against claims of innovation stagnation, this is a relatively weak positive.  The article also highlights his preference for AI stocks, suggesting potentially better returns elsewhere.  The macroeconomic factors discussed (inflation, bond yields) are largely irrelevant to Apple's specific reaction to this news.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models emphasizing Apple's strong fundamentals and AI potential, while others highlight concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus.  The lack of a strong catalyst in this news, combined with the mixed predictions, suggests a neutral outlook.  However, the slight positive sentiment from Cramer's comments, coupled with Apple's generally strong position, gives a marginal edge to a price rise.  The overall uncertainty and mixed signals from previous predictions lead to probabilities closer to 0.5 than to extreme values.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a timeless stalwart with a strong reputation, its foray into AI with new tools and chip development, and its position as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. These factors could attract investor interest and support a price rise.

It highlights that Apple's growth is expected to slow down, and the stock has already experienced an 8% decline year-to-date. Additionally, rising bond yields have negatively impacted the Mag7 names, including Apple. However, some models also consider Apple's strong fundamentals, its foray into AI, and its position as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which could support a price rise. The overall sentiment appears mixed, but with a cautious or negative outlook for Apple in the short term. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a strongly negative outlook for Apple's stock performance, indicating potential challenges or downward trends. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there's a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Some models cited specific reasons such as the potential slowdown in earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' and Apple's recent underperformance.

It highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date and that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down. Rising bond yields are also mentioned as a negative factor for the Mag 7.

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. However, the trend seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook for Apple. Therefore, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect this increased probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news piece is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price movement.  Jim Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation counters the narrative of stagnation, offering a mildly positive sentiment. However, this is tempered by his preference for AI stocks and the overall market uncertainties discussed (inflation, bond yields).  The previous predictions show significant divergence, with probabilities ranging from 0.2 to 0.75 for a price rise. This wide range reflects the lack of a strong, decisive catalyst in the news itself.  The overall financial health of Apple, as indicated by its debt management and cash flow, is a positive factor. However, concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus towards other sectors remain. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a strong directional influence from the news, I'm assigning probabilities closer to a neutral stance, slightly favoring a price rise due to Apple's generally strong fundamentals and Cramer's mild defense of its innovation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which generally instills confidence among investors. However, it also points out recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which may raise concerns. The mention of Apple's potential growth in the AI sector could serve as a positive catalyst, but the overall sentiment appears mixed due to the company's recent performance. Considering the previous predictions, there is a slight tilt towards a price rise due to the positive framing of Apple as a Buffett stock, despite the concerns raised about its recent performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, with expectations of 11% earnings growth for the 493 stocks outside of the Mag7.

The overall sentiment appears mixed, but with a cautious or negative outlook for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a strongly negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there's a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Some models cited specific reasons such as the potential slowdown in earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' and Apple's recent underperformance. However, a few models presented a more positive outlook based on Apple's strong fundamentals and potential in AI. Given the negative tone of the headline and the overall trend in previous predictions, I infer that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. The mixed sentiment among the models, with some emphasizing positive factors like Apple's innovation and financial stability, while others highlight concerns about growth and investor focus, leads to a balanced but cautious outlook. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be less than 0.5, reflecting the overall negative sentiment and trend towards a potential decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative approach to debt management, noting a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage, which suggests financial stability and effective debt management. This is generally viewed positively by investors. However, there are mixed signals from previous predictions, with some emphasizing the potential for stock price rise due to strong fundamentals and AI potential, and others focusing on potential headwinds such as reduced stake by Berkshire Hathaway, stagnation in revenue, and a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven'. Considering these points, the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic but with notable concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
