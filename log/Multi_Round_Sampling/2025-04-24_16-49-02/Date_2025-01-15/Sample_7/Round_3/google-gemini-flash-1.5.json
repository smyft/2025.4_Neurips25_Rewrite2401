(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, which could indicate some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's foray into AI could be a positive catalyst for future growth, but the current market sentiment may be mixed due to the recent performance. Overall, the probabilities reflect a slight edge towards a price rise due to the positive framing of Apple as a Buffett stock, despite the concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. While the overall market outlook might be positive, the article specifically highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date. The article suggests that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down, and investors may not be anticipating this change. This could lead to a further decrease in investor interest in Apple, potentially driving its stock price down. The article also mentions rising bond yields negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. The article does not mention any specific positive catalysts for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple's innovation and its position within the broader market context.  Cramer's dismissal of the claim that Apple's innovation has stagnated since Steve Jobs' death is mildly positive for Apple. However, the article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks and suggests that other companies might offer better returns in the short term.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly positive regarding Apple, but not overwhelmingly so. The broader market context discussed (inflation, bond market behavior) is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific stock movement in response to this news. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is slightly higher than the probability of a price decrease, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's recommended stocks, highlighting its timeless reputation and potential growth in the AI sector despite recent stagnant revenue and Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake. The article suggests that Apple's new AI-powered tools and development of AI data center chips could position it for future growth. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake and stagnant iPhone sales may weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the positive outlook on AI and Apple's strong brand may outweigh the negatives, but the impact is likely moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for stocks outside of the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7) to perform well, citing expectations of 11% earnings growth for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500. It also mentions that the Mag7, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL), is expected to see a slowdown in earnings growth. Specifically, AAPL is noted to be down 8% year to date. The article suggests that investors may be overly focused on the Mag7 and that there are good investing opportunities in other sectors, such as financials. The overall tone implies a cautious or negative outlook for the Mag7, including AAPL, in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline typically indicates potential challenges or downward trends that could affect the company's stock price. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. However, without specific details on the reasons behind the potential decline, the exact probabilities are speculative. Generally, such headlines can lead to investor caution or selling, which would decrease the stock price. Yet, the market's reaction can be unpredictable and depends on various factors including the company's overall performance, industry trends, and broader economic conditions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a cautious approach towards using debt, maintaining a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests a financially stable position which is generally viewed positively by investors. The company's ability to generate robust free cash flow further supports its financial health. While it carries some debt, it is managed effectively, and there are no immediate signs of financial risk.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which generally instills confidence among investors. However, it also points out recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which may raise concerns. The mention of Apple's potential growth in the AI sector could serve as a positive catalyst, but the overall sentiment appears mixed due to the company's recent performance. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with significant caution due to the negative indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. It highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date and that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down. Rising bond yields are also mentioned as negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. Considering the negative aspects highlighted in the news and the trend of some models predicting a fall, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple and the broader market. Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation is mildly positive, but his preference for AI stocks and the overall market context (inflation, bond yields) are largely neutral to slightly negative for Apple.  The article doesn't present any strong bullish or bearish catalysts specific to Apple.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion. Some models highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and potential in AI, while others emphasize concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus.  The lack of a significant positive or negative catalyst in this news, coupled with the mixed predictions from other models, suggests a relatively neutral outlook.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a price rise, reflecting the mildly positive sentiment from Cramer's comments, but acknowledging the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a timeless stalwart with a strong reputation, its foray into AI with new tools and chip development, and its position as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. These factors could attract investor interest and support a price rise. On the negative side, the article notes stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, which could signal caution and potentially lead to a price fall. The overall tone is balanced but leans slightly positive due to the long-term growth potential in AI. Considering the previous predictions, which also show a mix of opinions but with a slight tilt towards a rise, the probability of a price rise is marginally higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, with expectations of 11% earnings growth for the 493 stocks outside of the Mag7. It also mentions that Apple's growth is expected to slow down, and the stock has already experienced an 8% decline year-to-date. Additionally, rising bond yields have negatively impacted the Mag7 names, including Apple. However, the overall tone does not explicitly predict a stock price fall but rather highlights a cautious outlook for Apple and the Mag7. Given this context, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be lower than that of a fall, reflecting a cautious or negative outlook for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a strongly negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline typically indicates potential challenges or downward trends that could affect the company's stock price. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising. The previous predictions from other models also show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models citing specific reasons such as the potential slowdown in earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' and Apple's recent underperformance. However, it's worth noting that some models had slightly different interpretations based on different news content, but the current headline's negative tone is a strong indicator of potential decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative approach to debt management, noting a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests financial stability and effective debt management, which are generally viewed positively by investors. The company's robust free cash flow generation further reinforces its financial health. While it has some debt, it is managed well, and there are no immediate signs of financial risk. These factors contribute to a positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which generally instills confidence among investors. However, it also points out recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which may raise concerns. The mention of Apple's potential growth in the AI sector could serve as a positive catalyst, but the overall sentiment appears mixed due to the company's recent performance. Considering the previous predictions, there is a slight tilt towards a price rise due to the positive framing of Apple as a Buffett stock, despite the concerns raised about its recent performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. It highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date and that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down. Rising bond yields are also mentioned as negatively impacting the Mag 7.

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. However, the trend seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook for Apple. Therefore, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect this increased probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's comments on Apple and the broader market.  While Cramer defends Apple against claims of innovation stagnation, this is a relatively weak positive.  The article also highlights his preference for AI stocks, suggesting potentially better returns elsewhere.  The macroeconomic factors discussed (inflation, bond yields) are largely irrelevant to Apple's specific reaction to this news.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models emphasizing Apple's strong fundamentals and AI potential, while others highlight concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus.  The lack of a strong catalyst in this news, combined with the mixed predictions, suggests a neutral outlook.  However, the slight positive sentiment from Cramer's comments, coupled with Apple's generally strong position, gives a marginal edge to a price rise.  The overall uncertainty and mixed signals from previous predictions lead to probabilities closer to 0.5 than to extreme values.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a timeless stalwart with a strong reputation, its foray into AI with new tools and chip development, and its position as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. These factors could attract investor interest and support a price rise.

Additionally, rising bond yields have negatively impacted the Mag7 names, including Apple. However, some models also consider Apple's strong fundamentals, its foray into AI, and its position as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which could support a price rise. The overall sentiment appears mixed, but with a cautious or negative outlook for Apple in the short term. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a strongly negative outlook for Apple's stock performance, indicating potential challenges or downward trends. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there's a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Some models cited specific reasons such as the potential slowdown in earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' and Apple's recent underperformance. However, a few models presented a more positive outlook based on Apple's strong fundamentals and potential in AI. Given the negative tone of the headline and the overall trend in previous predictions, I infer that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative approach to debt management, noting a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage.
