(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a strong investment choice alongside other Buffett picks, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, which could indicate some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's foray into AI could be a positive catalyst for future growth, but the current market sentiment may be mixed due to the recent performance. Overall, the probabilities reflect a slight edge towards a price rise due to the positive framing of Apple as a Buffett stock, despite the concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. While the overall market outlook might be positive, the article specifically highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date. The article suggests that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down, and investors may not be anticipating this change. This could lead to a further decrease in investor interest in Apple, potentially driving its stock price down. The article also mentions rising bond yields negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. The article does not mention any specific positive catalysts for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple's innovation and its position within the broader market context.  Cramer's dismissal of the claim that Apple's innovation has stagnated since Steve Jobs' death is mildly positive for Apple. However, the article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks and suggests that other companies might offer better returns in the short term.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly positive regarding Apple, but not overwhelmingly so. The broader market context discussed (inflation, bond market behavior) is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific stock movement in response to this news. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is slightly higher than the probability of a price decrease, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's recommended stocks, highlighting its timeless reputation and potential growth in the AI sector despite recent stagnant revenue and Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake. The article suggests that Apple's new AI-powered tools and development of AI data center chips could position it for future growth. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake and stagnant iPhone sales may weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the positive outlook on AI and Apple's strong brand may outweigh the negatives, but the impact is likely moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for stocks outside of the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7) to perform well, citing expectations of 11% earnings growth for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500. It also mentions that the Mag7, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL), is expected to see a slowdown in earnings growth. Specifically, AAPL is noted to be down 8% year to date. The article suggests that investors may be overly focused on the Mag7 and that there are good investing opportunities in other sectors, such as financials. The overall tone implies a cautious or negative outlook for the Mag7, including AAPL, in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline typically indicates potential challenges or downward trends that could affect the company's stock price. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. However, without specific details on the reasons behind the potential decline, the exact probabilities are speculative. Generally, such headlines can lead to investor caution or selling, which would decrease the stock price. Yet, the market's reaction can be unpredictable and depends on various factors including the company's overall performance, industry trends, and broader economic conditions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a cautious approach towards using debt, maintaining a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests a financially stable position which is generally viewed positively by investors. The company's ability to generate robust free cash flow further supports its financial health. While it carries some debt, it is managed effectively, and there are no immediate signs of financial risk.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which generally instills confidence among investors. However, it also points out recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which may raise concerns. The mention of Apple's potential growth in the AI sector could serve as a positive catalyst, but the overall sentiment appears mixed due to the company's recent performance. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with significant caution due to the negative indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. It highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date and that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down. Rising bond yields are also mentioned as negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. Considering the negative aspects highlighted in the news and the trend of some models predicting a fall, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple and the broader market. Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation is mildly positive, but his preference for AI stocks and the overall market context (inflation, bond yields) are largely neutral to slightly negative for Apple.  The article doesn't present any strong bullish or bearish catalysts specific to Apple.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion. Some models highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and potential in AI, while others emphasize concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus.  The lack of a significant positive or negative catalyst in this news, coupled with the mixed predictions from other models, suggests a relatively neutral outlook.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a price rise, reflecting the mildly positive sentiment from Cramer's comments, but acknowledging the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a timeless stalwart with a strong reputation, its foray into AI with new tools and chip development, and its position as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. These factors could attract investor interest and support a price rise. On the negative side, the article notes stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, which could signal caution and potentially lead to a price fall. The overall tone is balanced but leans slightly positive due to the long-term growth potential in AI. Considering the previous predictions, which also show a mix of opinions but with a slight tilt towards a rise, the probability of a price rise is marginally higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, with expectations of 11% earnings growth for the 493 stocks outside of the Mag7. It also mentions that Apple's growth is expected to slow down, and the stock has already experienced an 8% decline year-to-date. Additionally, rising bond yields have negatively impacted the Mag7 names, including Apple. However, the overall tone does not explicitly predict a stock price fall but rather highlights a cautious outlook for Apple and the Mag7. Given this context, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be lower than that of a fall, reflecting a cautious or negative outlook for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a strongly negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline typically indicates potential challenges or downward trends that could affect the company's stock price. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising. The previous predictions from other models also show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models citing specific reasons such as the potential slowdown in earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' and Apple's recent underperformance. However, it's worth noting that some models had slightly different interpretations based on different news content, but the current headline's negative tone is a strong indicator of potential decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative approach to debt management, noting a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. This suggests financial stability and effective debt management, which are generally viewed positively by investors. The company's robust free cash flow generation further reinforces its financial health. While it has some debt, it is managed well, and there are no immediate signs of financial risk. These factors contribute to a positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's status as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which generally instills confidence among investors.

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. However, the trend seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook for Apple. Therefore, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect this increased probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's comments on Apple and the broader market.  While Cramer defends Apple against claims of innovation stagnation, this is a relatively weak positive.  The article also highlights his preference for AI stocks, suggesting potentially better returns elsewhere.  The macroeconomic factors discussed (inflation, bond yields) are largely irrelevant to Apple's specific reaction to this news.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models emphasizing Apple's strong fundamentals and AI potential, while others highlight concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus.  The lack of a strong catalyst in this news, combined with the mixed predictions, suggests a neutral outlook.  However, the slight positive sentiment from Cramer's comments, coupled with Apple's generally strong position, gives a marginal edge to a price rise.  The overall uncertainty and mixed signals from previous predictions lead to probabilities closer to 0.5 than to extreme values.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc.
