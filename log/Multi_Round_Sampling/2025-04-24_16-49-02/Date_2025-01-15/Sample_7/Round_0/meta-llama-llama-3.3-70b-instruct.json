This kind of headline typically indicates potential challenges or downward trends that could affect the company's stock price. Given the negative tone, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. However, without specific details on the reasons behind the potential decline, the exact probabilities are speculative. Generally, such headlines can lead to investor caution or selling, which would decrease the stock price. Yet, the market's reaction can be unpredictable and depends on various factors including the company's overall performance, industry trends, and broader economic conditions.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}"
