(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Goldman Sachs Eyes Early Apple Card Exit -- What It Means for Investors and Apple's Ecosystem\nNews Content: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple, as it could disrupt key features of its financial products. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer retention, the potential for operational disruption and negative sentiment from investors could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall due to the immediate concerns raised by the news, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple carries debt, its net debt is manageable due to its large cash reserves. Key positive indicators include a low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and strong free cash flow generation. The article also mentions a slight increase in EBIT, further easing debt repayment concerns. While the article acknowledges potential risks outside the balance sheet, the overall tone suggests financial stability and prudent debt utilization. This positive assessment is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a stock price increase. However, the article is not overwhelmingly bullish, and the market's reaction can be influenced by other factors not mentioned in the article. Therefore, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is assigned.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple's innovation and its position within the broader market context.  While Cramer dismisses criticism of Apple's post-Jobs innovation as 'inflammatory', the article also highlights the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy and the overall market's reliance on tech stocks, particularly those in the NASDAQ.  Cramer's comments are largely neutral, neither strongly positive nor negative towards Apple. The article itself promotes other AI stocks as potentially more lucrative investments, indirectly suggesting a less bullish outlook on Apple's short-term prospects.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is considered relatively low due to the lack of strong directional sentiment in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on his reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's statement about Apple's lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. Cramer defends Apple, highlighting its global integration and revenue streams. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock performance has been mixed, with a 4.3% decline year-to-date in 2025 due to concerns about AI integration and iPhone sales momentum. The broader market context, including inflation and bond market reactions, is also mentioned but does not directly impact Apple. Given the mixed sentiment and lack of significant positive or negative catalysts in the news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to Cramer's defense of the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and a high interest coverage ratio of 673 times. The company's ability to generate free cash flow, which is 90% of its EBIT, further supports its capacity to manage debt effectively. These factors suggest a positive outlook for Apple's financial health and stability. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price will rise as investors view the company's financial management positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article cites BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Gargi Chaudhuri, who expects the 493 other stocks to post an 11% earnings growth this year, faster than the 8% growth in 2024. Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024. Given this information, it seems that the article is bearish on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and bullish on the other S&P 500 stocks. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, as it could disrupt key features of its financial products. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer retention, the potential operational disruption and negative sentiment from investors could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, with some leaning towards a rise due to Apple's financial stability and others indicating a fall due to the partnership concerns, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the immediate concerns raised by the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative approach and strong financial health. Key indicators such as low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest that Apple is well-positioned to manage its debt obligations. While the article acknowledges potential risks, the overall tone is optimistic, suggesting that investors are likely to view Apple's financial management favorably. Considering the previous round predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the models that focused on financial health leaned towards a price increase. Given the consistent positive message in the news and the previous round's predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's comments on Apple, largely defending the company against criticisms of post-Steve Jobs innovation.  While Cramer's defense is positive, the article also highlights existing concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the overall market's reliance on tech stocks.  The article further suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns, indirectly hinting at a less bullish outlook for Apple in the short term.  The mixed sentiment, coupled with the previous predictions showing a wide range of probabilities (from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise), suggests a relatively neutral outlook.  The previous predictions' divergence indicates a lack of strong consensus on the impact of this news, reinforcing the neutral stance.  Considering the lack of significant positive or negative catalysts directly related to Apple's fundamentals in this news, the probabilities are weighted towards a slightly higher chance of a price remaining stable or experiencing a minor fluctuation rather than a significant rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

However, the article does not provide overwhelmingly negative information about Apple, and the company's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall, but not excessively so.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to debt management, with metrics such as a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage. The news emphasizes the company's ability to generate strong free cash flow, reinforcing its financial stability. While other predictions have varied, the consistent theme among the analyses is that the market views Apple's debt management positively. There is no significant negative news that would outweigh these positives.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, as it could disrupt key features of its financial products.

This suggests financial stability and prudent management, which are generally viewed positively by investors. Most previous predictions also leaned towards a positive or neutral outlook based on similar news. While some models considered external factors or broader market trends, the core message of the article is positive for Apple's financial health. Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece centers on Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against criticisms of its post-Steve Jobs innovation.

Some models emphasize Apple's strong financial health and debt management, leaning towards a price increase. Others focus on the uncertainty around AI and the overall market sentiment, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a major catalyst, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting Cramer's defense and Apple's generally strong financial position. However, the uncertainty surrounding AI and the broader market context prevents a strongly bullish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.
