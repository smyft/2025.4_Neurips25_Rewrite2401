(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple, as it could disrupt key features of its financial products. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer retention, the potential for operational disruption and negative sentiment from investors could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall due to the immediate concerns raised by the news, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple carries debt, its net debt is manageable due to its large cash reserves. Key positive indicators include a low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and strong free cash flow generation. The article also mentions a slight increase in EBIT, further easing debt repayment concerns. While the article acknowledges potential risks outside the balance sheet, the overall tone suggests financial stability and prudent debt utilization. This positive assessment is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a stock price increase. However, the article is not overwhelmingly bullish, and the market's reaction can be influenced by other factors not mentioned in the article. Therefore, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is assigned.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple's innovation and its position within the broader market context.  While Cramer dismisses criticism of Apple's post-Jobs innovation as 'inflammatory', the article also highlights the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy and the overall market's reliance on tech stocks, particularly those in the NASDAQ.  Cramer's comments are largely neutral, neither strongly positive nor negative towards Apple. The article itself promotes other AI stocks as potentially more lucrative investments, indirectly suggesting a less bullish outlook on Apple's short-term prospects.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is considered relatively low due to the lack of strong directional sentiment in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on his reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's statement about Apple's lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. Cramer defends Apple, highlighting its global integration and revenue streams. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock performance has been mixed, with a 4.3% decline year-to-date in 2025 due to concerns about AI integration and iPhone sales momentum. The broader market context, including inflation and bond market reactions, is also mentioned but does not directly impact Apple. Given the mixed sentiment and lack of significant positive or negative catalysts in the news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to Cramer's defense of the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and a high interest coverage ratio of 673 times. The company's ability to generate free cash flow, which is 90% of its EBIT, further supports its capacity to manage debt effectively. These factors suggest a positive outlook for Apple's financial health and stability. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price will rise as investors view the company's financial management positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article cites BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Gargi Chaudhuri, who expects the 493 other stocks to post an 11% earnings growth this year, faster than the 8% growth in 2024. Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024. Given this information, it seems that the article is bearish on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and bullish on the other S&P 500 stocks. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
