(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple, as it could disrupt key features of its financial products. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer retention, the potential for operational disruption and negative sentiment from investors could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall due to the immediate concerns raised by the news, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple carries debt, its net debt is manageable due to its large cash reserves. Key positive indicators include a low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and strong free cash flow generation. The article also mentions a slight increase in EBIT, further easing debt repayment concerns. While the article acknowledges potential risks outside the balance sheet, the overall tone suggests financial stability and prudent debt utilization. This positive assessment is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a stock price increase. However, the article is not overwhelmingly bullish, and the market's reaction can be influenced by other factors not mentioned in the article. Therefore, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is assigned.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple's innovation and its position within the broader market context.  While Cramer dismisses criticism of Apple's post-Jobs innovation as 'inflammatory', the article also highlights the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy and the overall market's reliance on tech stocks, particularly those in the NASDAQ.  Cramer's comments are largely neutral, neither strongly positive nor negative towards Apple. The article itself promotes other AI stocks as potentially more lucrative investments, indirectly suggesting a less bullish outlook on Apple's short-term prospects.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is considered relatively low due to the lack of strong directional sentiment in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on his reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's statement about Apple's lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. Cramer defends Apple, highlighting its global integration and revenue streams. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock performance has been mixed, with a 4.3% decline year-to-date in 2025 due to concerns about AI integration and iPhone sales momentum. The broader market context, including inflation and bond market reactions, is also mentioned but does not directly impact Apple. Given the mixed sentiment and lack of significant positive or negative catalysts in the news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to Cramer's defense of the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and a high interest coverage ratio of 673 times. The company's ability to generate free cash flow, which is 90% of its EBIT, further supports its capacity to manage debt effectively. These factors suggest a positive outlook for Apple's financial health and stability. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price will rise as investors view the company's financial management positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article cites BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Gargi Chaudhuri, who expects the 493 other stocks to post an 11% earnings growth this year, faster than the 8% growth in 2024. Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024. Given this information, it seems that the article is bearish on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and bullish on the other S&P 500 stocks. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, as it could disrupt key features of its financial products. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer retention, the potential operational disruption and negative sentiment from investors could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, with some leaning towards a rise due to Apple's financial stability and others indicating a fall due to the partnership concerns, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the immediate concerns raised by the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative approach and strong financial health. Key indicators such as low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest that Apple is well-positioned to manage its debt obligations. While the article acknowledges potential risks, the overall tone is optimistic, suggesting that investors are likely to view Apple's financial management favorably. Considering the previous round predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the models that focused on financial health leaned towards a price increase. Given the consistent positive message in the news and the previous round's predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's comments on Apple, largely defending the company against criticisms of post-Steve Jobs innovation.  While Cramer's defense is positive, the article also highlights existing concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the overall market's reliance on tech stocks.  The article further suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns, indirectly hinting at a less bullish outlook for Apple in the short term.  The mixed sentiment, coupled with the previous predictions showing a wide range of probabilities (from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise), suggests a relatively neutral outlook.  The previous predictions' divergence indicates a lack of strong consensus on the impact of this news, reinforcing the neutral stance.  Considering the lack of significant positive or negative catalysts directly related to Apple's fundamentals in this news, the probabilities are weighted towards a slightly higher chance of a price remaining stable or experiencing a minor fluctuation rather than a significant rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on his defense of the company's innovation post-Steve Jobs and its integration into global markets. However, the article also highlights mixed stock performance, with a 4.3% decline year-to-date in 2025 due to concerns about AI integration and iPhone sales momentum. The broader market context, including inflation and bond market reactions, is mentioned but does not directly impact Apple. Given the mixed sentiment and lack of significant positive or negative catalysts in the news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to Cramer's defense of the company. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a neutral or slightly positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management, highlighting its low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and a high interest coverage ratio of 673 times.

The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024. Given this information, it seems that the article is bearish on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and bullish on the other S&P 500 stocks. This, combined with the fact that Apple's stock has already fallen 8% year-to-date in 2025, suggests that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the article does not provide overwhelmingly negative information about Apple, and the company's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall, but not excessively so.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to debt management, with metrics such as a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage. The news emphasizes the company's ability to generate strong free cash flow, reinforcing its financial stability. While other predictions have varied, the consistent theme among the analyses is that the market views Apple's debt management positively. There is no significant negative news that would outweigh these positives.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
