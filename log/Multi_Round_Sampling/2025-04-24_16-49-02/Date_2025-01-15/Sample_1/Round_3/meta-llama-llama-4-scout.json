(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly addressing the perception of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer finds this view inflammatory, he also acknowledges the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context, especially regarding AI and iPhone sales. The overall sentiment appears cautious, with some concerns about Apple's ability to innovate and maintain sales momentum. Given the mixed signals and the broader market context, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, but slightly favoring a rise due to Cramer's positive remarks and the company's strong market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag of information regarding Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer defends Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and iPhone sales momentum. The article mentions AAPL shares being down 4.3% year-to-date. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, as the article suggests other AI stocks might offer better returns. The mention of PPI and bond market reactions are macro-economic factors that are not specific to Apple. The TikTok situation is also not directly related to Apple. Cramer's comments on Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are tangential. The hedge fund interest is a positive sign, but the article ultimately suggests other AI stocks are more promising. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, mentioning both positive and negative aspects.  While Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, the article emphasizes that it remains Berkshire's largest holding.  The article also points to Apple's potential growth in the AI sector with its new AI-powered tools and processor chip development. However, the article also notes recent revenue stagnation and iPhone sales.  The overall tone is somewhat neutral, acknowledging both potential upsides and downsides.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small compared to other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues, which could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem. However, Apple's strong brand and innovation capabilities may mitigate negative impacts. For Goldman Sachs, the exit could be seen as positive as it removes a loss-making segment, allowing focus on more profitable areas. For Apple, the short-term disruption might cause some investor concern, but long-term prospects remain strong given its ability to pivot and find new partners. The probability of a stock price fall for Apple is slightly higher due to immediate concerns, while Goldman Sachs might see a neutral to slightly positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL), to other S&P 500 stocks. The article suggests that the Mag 7 stocks, which have high valuations, may experience a slowdown in earnings growth, while other sectors like financials may see significant growth. Specifically, Apple's stock is mentioned as being down 8% year to date, and the article implies that high bond yields have negatively impacted Mag 7 stocks. Given this context, the news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price as investors consider alternatives with potentially better growth prospects at reasonable valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term, as it could disrupt the Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's ability to innovate and adapt to changes, as well as its strong brand and ecosystem, may mitigate the negative effects and potentially lead to a smooth transition to a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as a stock often recommended by Warren Buffett, emphasizing its timeless nature and potential future growth, particularly in AI and electric vehicles. However, it also mentions recent stagnation in revenue and sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway's reduced stake. This mixed sentiment suggests a cautious outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's defense of Apple Inc. against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which could be seen as a positive sentiment. However, there are concerns about Apple's ability to innovate in the AI space and maintain iPhone sales momentum, as well as the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context. The mention of other AI stocks potentially offering better returns adds a layer of caution. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Cramer's positive remarks and Apple's strong market position, but tempered by concerns about innovation and competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The current news focuses on Jim Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation, countering the narrative of stagnation since Steve Jobs. While this is a positive sentiment, the article also acknowledges concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and iPhone sales momentum, mirroring the mixed performance highlighted in previous rounds. The fact that the stock is down year-to-date is also a negative signal. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook, but Cramer's defense provides some counterweight. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect this slightly more balanced view, but still leaning towards a potential fall due to the existing concerns and negative YTD performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, highlighting both positive and negative aspects.  While Buffett's reduced stake in Apple might be interpreted negatively, the article emphasizes that it remains Berkshire's largest holding. The article also points to Apple's potential growth in the AI sector. However, it also notes recent revenue stagnation and iPhone sales. The overall tone is neutral, acknowledging both potential upsides and downsides.  The fact that this is a list of Buffett's holdings, and not specific news about Apple itself, suggests a limited impact on Apple's stock price.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely, and the lack of specific, impactful news about Apple in this article, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral. The mention of Apple in this context is likely to have a minimal effect on its stock price, with other market factors playing a much larger role.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple's financial services ecosystem, which could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and potential to pivot to a new partner (e.g., JPMorgan Chase) may mitigate long-term risks. The immediate disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could lead to some investor concern, but Apple's overall resilience and ecosystem strength provide a counterbalance. Given the mixed implications, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P500 stocks instead of the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Mag7 stocks, including AAPL, are expected to experience a slowdown in earnings growth, while other sectors may see significant growth. Specifically, AAPL's stock is down 8% year to date, and high bond yields have negatively impacted Mag7 stocks. However, the article also highlights the potential for growth in other sectors, such as financials. Given this context, the news may have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price as investors consider alternatives with potentially better growth prospects at reasonable valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and potential to find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may mitigate the negative effects. Considering the mixed signals and the company's ability to adapt, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price fall and others predicting a more balanced outcome. Taking into account the potential disruption to Apple's financial services ecosystem and the company's ability to innovate and pivot, the estimated probabilities are 0.42 for a stock price rise and 0.58 for a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple as one of Warren Buffett's recommended picks, highlighting its strong brand, past performance, and potential growth areas like AI and electric vehicles. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and iPhone sales, along with Berkshire Hathaway's reduced stake. The mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook. Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting differing views on the impact of recent developments. Given the overall cautious sentiment and mixed signals, the probabilities appear balanced, leaning slightly towards a rise due to Buffett's continued stake despite reductions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against claims of stagnation in innovation since Steve Jobs, which provides a positive sentiment. However, there are ongoing concerns about Apple's ability to innovate in the AI space and maintain iPhone sales momentum, as well as the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context. The mention of other AI stocks potentially offering better returns adds caution. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Cramer's positive remarks and Apple's strong market position, but tempered by concerns about innovation and competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The current news focuses on Jim Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation, which is a positive signal. However, the article also acknowledges concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and iPhone sales momentum, and the stock is down year-to-date. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Considering the mixed signals and the company's ability to adapt, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, but not significantly so. The fact that other AI stocks are considered more promising also weighs on the outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, but this is within a broader piece recommending several stocks.  The article highlights both positive (Buffett's continued large holding, potential AI growth) and negative (revenue stagnation, iPhone sales slowdown, Berkshire's reduced stake) aspects of Apple.  The overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it's not company-specific news but rather a mention within a broader investment strategy piece.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and the influence of other market factors.  Given the lack of significant new information about Apple itself, and the mixed signals presented, I'm assigning probabilities close to neutral, slightly favoring a rise due to the continued presence in Buffett's portfolio, but acknowledging the potential for minimal impact overall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from its Apple Card partnership, which could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem. This introduces short-term uncertainty and potential risks for Apple, which may negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and the possibility of finding a new partner like JPMorgan Chase could mitigate long-term negative effects. The immediate disruption to Apple Card and Savings products is a concern, but Apple's ability to pivot and adapt is a counterbalance. Given the mixed implications and the company's resilience, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P500 stocks instead of the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Mag7 stocks, including AAPL, are expected to experience a slowdown in earnings growth, while other sectors may see significant growth. Specifically, AAPL's stock is down 8% year to date, and high bond yields have negatively impacted Mag7 stocks. However, the article also highlights the potential for growth in other sectors, such as financials.

The immediate disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could lead to some investor concern, but Apple's overall resilience and ecosystem strength provide a counterbalance. Given the mixed implications and considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions, the estimated probabilities are based on a balanced view of the potential impact of this news on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple as one of Warren Buffett's recommended picks, emphasizing its strong brand, past performance, and potential growth areas like AI and electric vehicles. While it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and iPhone sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway's reduced stake, the overall tone is cautiously optimistic due to Buffett's continued stake. The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting mixed sentiments.
