(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly addressing the perception of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer finds this view inflammatory, he also acknowledges the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context, especially regarding AI and iPhone sales. The overall sentiment appears cautious, with some concerns about Apple's ability to innovate and maintain sales momentum. Given the mixed signals and the broader market context, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, but slightly favoring a rise due to Cramer's positive remarks and the company's strong market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag of information regarding Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer defends Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and iPhone sales momentum. The article mentions AAPL shares being down 4.3% year-to-date. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, as the article suggests other AI stocks might offer better returns. The mention of PPI and bond market reactions are macro-economic factors that are not specific to Apple. The TikTok situation is also not directly related to Apple. Cramer's comments on Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are tangential. The hedge fund interest is a positive sign, but the article ultimately suggests other AI stocks are more promising. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, mentioning both positive and negative aspects.  While Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, the article emphasizes that it remains Berkshire's largest holding.  The article also points to Apple's potential growth in the AI sector with its new AI-powered tools and processor chip development. However, the article also notes recent revenue stagnation and iPhone sales.  The overall tone is somewhat neutral, acknowledging both potential upsides and downsides.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small compared to other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues, which could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem. However, Apple's strong brand and innovation capabilities may mitigate negative impacts. For Goldman Sachs, the exit could be seen as positive as it removes a loss-making segment, allowing focus on more profitable areas. For Apple, the short-term disruption might cause some investor concern, but long-term prospects remain strong given its ability to pivot and find new partners. The probability of a stock price fall for Apple is slightly higher due to immediate concerns, while Goldman Sachs might see a neutral to slightly positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL), to other S&P 500 stocks. The article suggests that the Mag 7 stocks, which have high valuations, may experience a slowdown in earnings growth, while other sectors like financials may see significant growth. Specifically, Apple's stock is mentioned as being down 8% year to date, and the article implies that high bond yields have negatively impacted Mag 7 stocks. Given this context, the news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price as investors consider alternatives with potentially better growth prospects at reasonable valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term, as it could disrupt the Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's ability to innovate and adapt to changes, as well as its strong brand and ecosystem, may mitigate the negative effects and potentially lead to a smooth transition to a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as a stock often recommended by Warren Buffett, emphasizing its timeless nature and potential future growth, particularly in AI and electric vehicles. However, it also mentions recent stagnation in revenue and sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway's reduced stake. This mixed sentiment suggests a cautious outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's defense of Apple Inc. against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which could be seen as a positive sentiment. However, there are concerns about Apple's ability to innovate in the AI space and maintain iPhone sales momentum, as well as the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context. The mention of other AI stocks potentially offering better returns adds a layer of caution. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Cramer's positive remarks and Apple's strong market position, but tempered by concerns about innovation and competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The current news focuses on Jim Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation, countering the narrative of stagnation since Steve Jobs. While this is a positive sentiment, the article also acknowledges concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and iPhone sales momentum, mirroring the mixed performance highlighted in previous rounds. The fact that the stock is down year-to-date is also a negative signal. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook, but Cramer's defense provides some counterweight. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect this slightly more balanced view, but still leaning towards a potential fall due to the existing concerns and negative YTD performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, highlighting both positive and negative aspects.  While Buffett's reduced stake in Apple might be interpreted negatively, the article emphasizes that it remains Berkshire's largest holding. The article also points to Apple's potential growth in the AI sector. However, it also notes recent revenue stagnation and iPhone sales. The overall tone is neutral, acknowledging both potential upsides and downsides.  The fact that this is a list of Buffett's holdings, and not specific news about Apple itself, suggests a limited impact on Apple's stock price.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely, and the lack of specific, impactful news about Apple in this article, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral. The mention of Apple in this context is likely to have a minimal effect on its stock price, with other market factors playing a much larger role.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple's financial services ecosystem, which could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and potential to pivot to a new partner (e.g., JPMorgan Chase) may mitigate long-term risks. The immediate disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could lead to some investor concern, but Apple's overall resilience and ecosystem strength provide a counterbalance. Given the mixed implications, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P500 stocks instead of the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Mag7 stocks, including AAPL, are expected to experience a slowdown in earnings growth, while other sectors may see significant growth. Specifically, AAPL's stock is down 8% year to date, and high bond yields have negatively impacted Mag7 stocks. However, the article also highlights the potential for growth in other sectors, such as financials. Given this context, the news may have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price as investors consider alternatives with potentially better growth prospects at reasonable valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and potential to find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, may mitigate the negative effects. Considering the mixed signals and the company's ability to adapt, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price fall and others predicting a more balanced outcome. Taking into account the potential disruption to Apple's financial services ecosystem and the company's ability to innovate and pivot, the estimated probabilities are 0.42 for a stock price rise and 0.58 for a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple as one of Warren Buffett's recommended picks, highlighting its strong brand, past performance, and potential growth areas like AI and electric vehicles. However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and iPhone sales, along with Berkshire Hathaway's reduced stake. The mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook. Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting differing views on the impact of recent developments. Given the overall cautious sentiment and mixed signals, the probabilities appear balanced, leaning slightly towards a rise due to Buffett's continued stake despite reductions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against claims of stagnation in innovation since Steve Jobs, which provides a positive sentiment. However, there are ongoing concerns about Apple's ability to innovate in the AI space and maintain iPhone sales momentum, as well as the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context. The mention of other AI stocks potentially offering better returns adds caution. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Cramer's positive remarks and Apple's strong market position, but tempered by concerns about innovation and competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The current news focuses on Jim Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation, which is a positive signal. However, the article also acknowledges concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and iPhone sales momentum, and the stock is down year-to-date. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Considering the mixed signals and the company's ability to adapt, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, but not significantly so. The fact that other AI stocks are considered more promising also weighs on the outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, but this is within a broader piece recommending several stocks.  The article highlights both positive (Buffett's continued large holding, potential AI growth) and negative (revenue stagnation, iPhone sales slowdown, Berkshire's reduced stake) aspects of Apple.  The overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it's not company-specific news but rather a mention within a broader investment strategy piece.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and the influence of other market factors.  Given the lack of significant new information about Apple itself, and the mixed signals presented, I'm assigning probabilities close to neutral, slightly favoring a rise due to the continued presence in Buffett's portfolio, but acknowledging the potential for minimal impact overall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from its Apple Card partnership, which could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem. This introduces short-term uncertainty and potential risks for Apple, which may negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and the possibility of finding a new partner like JPMorgan Chase could mitigate long-term negative effects. The immediate disruption to Apple Card and Savings products is a concern, but Apple's ability to pivot and adapt is a counterbalance. Given the mixed implications and the company's resilience, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P500 stocks instead of the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Mag7 stocks, including AAPL, are expected to experience a slowdown in earnings growth, while other sectors may see significant growth.

While it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and iPhone sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway's reduced stake, the overall tone is cautiously optimistic due to Buffett's continued stake. The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting mixed sentiments. Given the cautious optimism and the mixed signals, the probabilities appear balanced, leaning slightly towards a rise.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against claims of stagnation in innovation since Steve Jobs, which provides a positive sentiment.

Considering the mixed signals and the company's ability to adapt, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, but not significantly so. The trend in previous rounds shows a slight increase in the probability of a fall, which I will incorporate into my prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, but this is within a broader piece recommending several stocks.

The slight lean towards a rise reflects Buffett's continued significant investment, but the overall impact of this news alone is likely to be small compared to other market forces.  The consensus from previous models shows a range from 0.3 to 0.55 for a price rise, and 0.45 to 0.7 for a price fall, indicating significant uncertainty. My prediction reflects a cautious optimism, acknowledging the mixed signals and the limited impact of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple's financial services ecosystem, which could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term.
