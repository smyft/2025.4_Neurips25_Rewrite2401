(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly addressing the perception of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer finds this view inflammatory, he also acknowledges the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context, especially regarding AI and iPhone sales. The overall sentiment appears cautious, with some concerns about Apple's ability to innovate and maintain sales momentum. Given the mixed signals and the broader market context, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, but slightly favoring a rise due to Cramer's positive remarks and the company's strong market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag of information regarding Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer defends Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and iPhone sales momentum. The article mentions AAPL shares being down 4.3% year-to-date. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, as the article suggests other AI stocks might offer better returns. The mention of PPI and bond market reactions are macro-economic factors that are not specific to Apple. The TikTok situation is also not directly related to Apple. Cramer's comments on Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are tangential. The hedge fund interest is a positive sign, but the article ultimately suggests other AI stocks are more promising. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, mentioning both positive and negative aspects.  While Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, the article emphasizes that it remains Berkshire's largest holding.  The article also points to Apple's potential growth in the AI sector with its new AI-powered tools and processor chip development. However, the article also notes recent revenue stagnation and iPhone sales.  The overall tone is somewhat neutral, acknowledging both potential upsides and downsides.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small compared to other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues, which could disrupt Apple's financial services ecosystem. However, Apple's strong brand and innovation capabilities may mitigate negative impacts. For Goldman Sachs, the exit could be seen as positive as it removes a loss-making segment, allowing focus on more profitable areas. For Apple, the short-term disruption might cause some investor concern, but long-term prospects remain strong given its ability to pivot and find new partners. The probability of a stock price fall for Apple is slightly higher due to immediate concerns, while Goldman Sachs might see a neutral to slightly positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL), to other S&P 500 stocks. The article suggests that the Mag 7 stocks, which have high valuations, may experience a slowdown in earnings growth, while other sectors like financials may see significant growth. Specifically, Apple's stock is mentioned as being down 8% year to date, and the article implies that high bond yields have negatively impacted Mag 7 stocks. Given this context, the news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price as investors consider alternatives with potentially better growth prospects at reasonable valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term, as it could disrupt the Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's ability to innovate and adapt to changes, as well as its strong brand and ecosystem, may mitigate the negative effects and potentially lead to a smooth transition to a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as a stock often recommended by Warren Buffett, emphasizing its timeless nature and potential future growth, particularly in AI and electric vehicles. However, it also mentions recent stagnation in revenue and sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway's reduced stake. This mixed sentiment suggests a cautious outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
