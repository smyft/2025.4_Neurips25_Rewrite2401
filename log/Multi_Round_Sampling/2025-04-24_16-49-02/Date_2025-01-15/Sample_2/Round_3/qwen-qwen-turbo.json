(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating that the stock could face significant downward pressure this year. Such negative sentiment typically leads to a higher probability of stock price decline. Given the lack of positive news or mitigating factors in the headline, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status. While it acknowledges stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, it also points out Buffett's potential strategic reasons for reducing Berkshire's stake and the company's significant investment in AI. The article mentions Apple's development of an AI-powered tool and a processor chip for AI data centers, aligning with the expected growth in the AI platform market. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting potential for future growth driven by AI initiatives. However, the stagnant revenue and reduced stake by Berkshire introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors, there's a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the AI potential, but the existing challenges temper the optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, mentioning both positive and negative aspects.  While Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, the article emphasizes that it remains Berkshire's largest holding.  The article also points to Apple's foray into AI as a potential driver of future growth. However, the recent stagnation in iPhone sales and overall revenue is a counterpoint.  The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting potential for future growth but acknowledging current challenges.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small compared to other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's recommended stocks, highlighting its timeless reputation and potential growth in the AI sector despite recent stagnant revenue and Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake. The article suggests that Apple's new AI-powered tools and development of AI data center chips could position it for future growth. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake and stagnant iPhone sales may weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the positive outlook on AI and Apple's strong brand may outweigh the negatives, but the impact is likely moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7) stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL), to other S&P500 stocks. The article suggests that the Mag7 stocks, which have driven market headlines and investor attention, may experience a slowdown in earnings growth. Specifically, it mentions that Mag7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from their 25% pace in 2024. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the Mag7 and has seen its stock price down 8% year to date. The article highlights that other sectors, such as financials, may offer better investment opportunities with expected high earnings growth. Given that Apple is part of the Mag7 and the article implies a potential slowdown in earnings growth for these stocks, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the company's potential for growth in the AI arena. Although Apple's revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, and Berkshire Hathaway has been paring back its stake in the company, the article suggests that Apple may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. The launch of an AI-powered tool and the development of a processor chip for AI data centers are seen as positive developments. However, the article also notes that the company's place in the AI arena is not yet clear. Given these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer defending the company's innovation record and highlighting its strong stock performance. Despite mentioning concerns about innovation post-Steve Jobs, the overall tone is supportive of the company. The news also notes positive trends in the market and the stock's performance since the WWDC conference. However, it mentions investor uncertainty regarding AI integration and iPhone sales. Given the generally positive stance and historical performance of the stock, the impact of negative sentiments appears to be outweighed.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating potential downward pressure on the stock price. This aligns with the previous predictions that show a range of sentiments, with many leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall due to concerns about stagnant revenue, reduced stake by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential shifts in investor focus. While some predictions highlight Apple's AI initiatives as a positive factor, the overall tone of the news is cautionary, leading to a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. On one hand, it's a Warren Buffett pick, a 'timeless stalwart' with potential in AI. On the other hand, revenue and iPhone sales are stagnant, and Buffett has reduced his stake. The article suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction and highlights Apple's AI initiatives. Previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise due to AI potential and others towards a fall due to stagnant growth and stake reduction. Considering the mixed signals and the trend of previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not as strongly as some previous models.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick and mentions its potential for growth in the AI sector, it also acknowledges stagnant revenue, declining iPhone sales, and Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its Apple stake.  The positive aspects include Apple's foray into AI with a new AI-powered tool and the development of an AI processor chip. However, the negative aspects, particularly the reduction in Berkshire's stake, raise concerns about investor confidence.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise due to AI potential and others predicting a fall due to stagnant revenue and reduced Berkshire holdings. Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the potential upside from AI, but acknowledging the significant countervailing factors. The fact that this is a list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1000 suggests a generally positive sentiment, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc.

It's highlighted as a Warren Buffett pick, a 'timeless stalwart' with potential in AI, which is a positive signal. However, stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, coupled with Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake, introduce uncertainty. While the article suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction and highlights Apple's AI initiatives, the negative aspects cannot be ignored. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight trend towards a more optimistic outlook in the most recent round.

While it's included in a list of Warren Buffett's picks, highlighting its enduring brand and potential in AI,  significant counterpoints exist.  Stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, coupled with Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its stake (though still a major holding), introduce considerable uncertainty.  The AI initiatives are promising, but their impact on the near-term stock price is unclear.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with no clear consensus.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the potential upside from AI and the overall positive sentiment associated with being a Buffett pick. However, the current market challenges and uncertainty temper this optimism.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc.
