(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating that the stock could face significant downward pressure this year. Such negative sentiment typically leads to a higher probability of stock price decline. Given the lack of positive news or mitigating factors in the headline, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status. While it acknowledges stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, it also points out Buffett's potential strategic reasons for reducing Berkshire's stake and the company's significant investment in AI. The article mentions Apple's development of an AI-powered tool and a processor chip for AI data centers, aligning with the expected growth in the AI platform market. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting potential for future growth driven by AI initiatives. However, the stagnant revenue and reduced stake by Berkshire introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors, there's a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the AI potential, but the existing challenges temper the optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, mentioning both positive and negative aspects.  While Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, the article emphasizes that it remains Berkshire's largest holding.  The article also points to Apple's foray into AI as a potential driver of future growth. However, the recent stagnation in iPhone sales and overall revenue is a counterpoint.  The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting potential for future growth but acknowledging current challenges.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small compared to other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's recommended stocks, highlighting its timeless reputation and potential growth in the AI sector despite recent stagnant revenue and Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake. The article suggests that Apple's new AI-powered tools and development of AI data center chips could position it for future growth. However, the reduction in Berkshire's stake and stagnant iPhone sales may weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the positive outlook on AI and Apple's strong brand may outweigh the negatives, but the impact is likely moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7) stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL), to other S&P500 stocks. The article suggests that the Mag7 stocks, which have driven market headlines and investor attention, may experience a slowdown in earnings growth. Specifically, it mentions that Mag7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from their 25% pace in 2024. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the Mag7 and has seen its stock price down 8% year to date. The article highlights that other sectors, such as financials, may offer better investment opportunities with expected high earnings growth. Given that Apple is part of the Mag7 and the article implies a potential slowdown in earnings growth for these stocks, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the company's potential for growth in the AI arena. Although Apple's revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, and Berkshire Hathaway has been paring back its stake in the company, the article suggests that Apple may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. The launch of an AI-powered tool and the development of a processor chip for AI data centers are seen as positive developments. However, the article also notes that the company's place in the AI arena is not yet clear. Given these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer defending the company's innovation record and highlighting its strong stock performance. Despite mentioning concerns about innovation post-Steve Jobs, the overall tone is supportive of the company. The news also notes positive trends in the market and the stock's performance since the WWDC conference. However, it mentions investor uncertainty regarding AI integration and iPhone sales. Given the generally positive stance and historical performance of the stock, the impact of negative sentiments appears to be outweighed.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
