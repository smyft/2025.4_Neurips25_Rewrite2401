(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty, the potential disruption to services and features could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. However, Apple's overall business remains robust, and the company has a history of successfully navigating challenges. Therefore, while there is a significant risk of a stock price decline due to this news, the strong fundamentals of Apple may mitigate the extent of the fall. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status. While revenue has been stagnant and Berkshire has reduced its stake, the article suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction and highlights Apple's significant investment in AI, a rapidly growing market. The article also mentions that Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined. This positive sentiment, coupled with the AI initiatives, suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise. However, the stagnant revenue and stake reduction temper the optimism, leading to a more balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative use of debt, highlighting its strong financial position with low net debt and high interest coverage.  The article concludes that Apple's debt management is reasonable and poses little risk. While the article mentions two unspecified warning signs, it doesn't elaborate on their nature or severity.  The overall tone is positive regarding Apple's financial health.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small given Apple's overall market position and the fact that the news is not exceptionally positive or negative.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the limited impact of this specific news item on a large-cap stock like Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various topics, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Cramer defends Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs, the article does not provide any significant new information or catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The discussion is more about broader market trends and other companies like TikTok and Elon Musk's ventures. Given the lack of concrete positive or negative news specific to Apple, the impact on the stock price is likely neutral. The article mentions Apple's mixed performance in the AI era and a slight year-to-date decline, but these are not new developments. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this news are balanced and minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the company's potential for growth in the AI arena. Although Apple's revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, and sales of its flagship iPhone have been stagnant for just as long, the company is developing new technologies such as an AI-powered tool and a processor chip that could power its own AI data centers. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth of the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance, which is likely to cause investor concern. Such headlines typically lead to selling pressure on the stock as investors adjust their expectations and positions. Given the negative sentiment expressed in the headline, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman. This potential disruption could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. While Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty may help mitigate the impact, the immediate reaction from investors is likely to be cautious. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to the uncertainty introduced by the news. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. On one hand, it's highlighted as a Warren Buffett pick, a 'timeless stalwart' with potential in the AI arena. Berkshire Hathaway maintains a massive stake in Apple. On the other hand, revenue stagnation and a reduction in Berkshire's stake are mentioned. The article suggests the stake reduction might be strategic. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the mixed signals and the existing uncertainty reflected in the previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a rise due to the Buffett endorsement and AI potential, but keep the probabilities relatively close to even.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's prudent use of debt, presenting a positive view of its financial health.  Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage are highlighted. While the article mentions unspecified warning signs, the overall tone is overwhelmingly positive regarding Apple's financial stability.  This positive assessment of Apple's financial strength is unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in the short term, given Apple's already established market position and the generally positive sentiment surrounding the company.  However, the lack of substantial new information means the impact is likely to be minimal. Considering the previous predictions, which range widely, and the generally positive sentiment around Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the limited impact of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various topics, including Apple Inc.

Such headlines typically lead to selling pressure on the stock as investors adjust their expectations and positions. The previous predictions from other models show varying sentiments, but many lean towards a lower probability of stock price rise. Considering the bearish sentiment expressed in the headline and the overall cautious outlook, it seems prudent to align with the model predicting a higher probability of stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman.

On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status and potential in the AI arena. Berkshire Hathaway maintains a significant stake in Apple, although they have reduced it recently. On the negative side, revenue has been stagnant, and the article mentions the stake reduction. However, it also suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction. The previous predictions are varied, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the Buffett endorsement, the AI potential, and the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise. However, the stagnant revenue and stake reduction temper the optimism, leading to a more balanced probability assessment.
