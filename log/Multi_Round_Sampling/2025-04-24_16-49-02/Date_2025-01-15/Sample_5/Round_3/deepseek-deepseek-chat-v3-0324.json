(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty, the potential disruption to services and features could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. However, Apple's overall business remains robust, and the company has a history of successfully navigating challenges. Therefore, while there is a significant risk of a stock price decline due to this news, the strong fundamentals of Apple may mitigate the extent of the fall. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status. While revenue has been stagnant and Berkshire has reduced its stake, the article suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction and highlights Apple's significant investment in AI, a rapidly growing market. The article also mentions that Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined. This positive sentiment, coupled with the AI initiatives, suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise. However, the stagnant revenue and stake reduction temper the optimism, leading to a more balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative use of debt, highlighting its strong financial position with low net debt and high interest coverage.  The article concludes that Apple's debt management is reasonable and poses little risk. While the article mentions two unspecified warning signs, it doesn't elaborate on their nature or severity.  The overall tone is positive regarding Apple's financial health.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small given Apple's overall market position and the fact that the news is not exceptionally positive or negative.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the limited impact of this specific news item on a large-cap stock like Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various topics, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Cramer defends Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs, the article does not provide any significant new information or catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The discussion is more about broader market trends and other companies like TikTok and Elon Musk's ventures. Given the lack of concrete positive or negative news specific to Apple, the impact on the stock price is likely neutral. The article mentions Apple's mixed performance in the AI era and a slight year-to-date decline, but these are not new developments. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this news are balanced and minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the company's potential for growth in the AI arena. Although Apple's revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, and sales of its flagship iPhone have been stagnant for just as long, the company is developing new technologies such as an AI-powered tool and a processor chip that could power its own AI data centers. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth of the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance, which is likely to cause investor concern. Such headlines typically lead to selling pressure on the stock as investors adjust their expectations and positions. Given the negative sentiment expressed in the headline, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman. This potential disruption could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. While Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty may help mitigate the impact, the immediate reaction from investors is likely to be cautious. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to the uncertainty introduced by the news. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple. On one hand, it's highlighted as a Warren Buffett pick, a 'timeless stalwart' with potential in the AI arena. Berkshire Hathaway maintains a massive stake in Apple. On the other hand, revenue stagnation and a reduction in Berkshire's stake are mentioned. The article suggests the stake reduction might be strategic. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the mixed signals and the existing uncertainty reflected in the previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a rise due to the Buffett endorsement and AI potential, but keep the probabilities relatively close to even.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's prudent use of debt, presenting a positive view of its financial health.  Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage are highlighted. While the article mentions unspecified warning signs, the overall tone is overwhelmingly positive regarding Apple's financial stability.  This positive assessment of Apple's financial strength is unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in the short term, given Apple's already established market position and the generally positive sentiment surrounding the company.  However, the lack of substantial new information means the impact is likely to be minimal. Considering the previous predictions, which range widely, and the generally positive sentiment around Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the limited impact of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various topics, including Apple Inc.

Such headlines typically lead to selling pressure on the stock as investors adjust their expectations and positions. The previous predictions from other models show varying sentiments, but many lean towards a lower probability of stock price rise. Considering the bearish sentiment expressed in the headline and the overall cautious outlook, it seems prudent to align with the model predicting a higher probability of stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman.

On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status and potential in the AI arena. Berkshire Hathaway maintains a significant stake in Apple, although they have reduced it recently. On the negative side, revenue has been stagnant, and the article mentions the stake reduction. However, it also suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction. The previous predictions are varied, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the Buffett endorsement, the AI potential, and the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise. However, the stagnant revenue and stake reduction temper the optimism, leading to a more balanced probability assessment. The 'Double Down' advertisement within the article also suggests a positive outlook, although it should be taken with a grain of salt as it is promotional material.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, presenting a positive picture of its financial health.

However, considering the mixed performance of Apple in the AI era and the slight year-to-date decline, the probabilities seem to reflect a cautious optimism.
