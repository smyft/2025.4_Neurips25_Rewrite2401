(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty, the potential disruption to services and features could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. However, Apple's overall business remains robust, and the company has a history of successfully navigating challenges. Therefore, while there is a significant risk of a stock price decline due to this news, the strong fundamentals of Apple may mitigate the extent of the fall. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the potential exit of Goldman Sachs from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial services offerings. This could negatively impact user experience and loyalty, at least in the short term. The reliance on Goldman for backend support means a partner swap could be complex and potentially costly. On the other hand, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer focus, suggesting they are likely to manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could provide a stable alternative. The overall impact on Apple's core business is likely to be limited, as the Apple Card is a relatively small part of their overall revenue. Given Apple's resilience and ability to adapt, the negative impact is likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, suggesting it as a potential investment. However, the article also notes that Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its Apple stake recently, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence.  While Apple's foray into AI is mentioned as a potential growth driver, the overall tone regarding Apple's recent performance is mixed (stagnant revenue and iPhone sales).  The mention of Buffett's investment is positive, but the reduction in Berkshire's holdings introduces uncertainty. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, while the probability of a fall is relatively low, reflecting the overall mixed signals in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks due to potentially more favorable valuations and earnings growth in sectors like financials. It mentions that Apple's stock is already down 8% year to date, indicating negative sentiment. The article also highlights the impact of higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations, which could further pressure tech stocks like Apple. Given this context, the likelihood of Apple's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock price, indicating potential for a decline. The article's title 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' implies a bearish sentiment, which could lead to a decrease in stock price if investors react negatively to the information or outlook presented.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to potentially inflated tech expectations and higher bond yields. The article highlights that the 493 other stocks could post an 11% earnings growth this year, which may not be reflected in their current valuations. Additionally, the financials sector, which is part of the 493 stocks, is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter. This information implies that the focus might shift away from the 'Magnificent Seven' towards other stocks with potentially stronger growth prospects. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and the article implies a potential shift in investor focus, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news might be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
