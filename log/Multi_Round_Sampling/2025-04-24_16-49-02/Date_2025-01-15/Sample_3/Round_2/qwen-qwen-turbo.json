(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty, the potential disruption to services and features could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. However, Apple's overall business remains robust, and the company has a history of successfully navigating challenges. Therefore, while there is a significant risk of a stock price decline due to this news, the strong fundamentals of Apple may mitigate the extent of the fall. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the potential exit of Goldman Sachs from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial services offerings. This could negatively impact user experience and loyalty, at least in the short term. The reliance on Goldman for backend support means a partner swap could be complex and potentially costly. On the other hand, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer focus, suggesting they are likely to manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could provide a stable alternative. The overall impact on Apple's core business is likely to be limited, as the Apple Card is a relatively small part of their overall revenue. Given Apple's resilience and ability to adapt, the negative impact is likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, suggesting it as a potential investment. However, the article also notes that Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its Apple stake recently, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence.  While Apple's foray into AI is mentioned as a potential growth driver, the overall tone regarding Apple's recent performance is mixed (stagnant revenue and iPhone sales).  The mention of Buffett's investment is positive, but the reduction in Berkshire's holdings introduces uncertainty. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, while the probability of a fall is relatively low, reflecting the overall mixed signals in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks due to potentially more favorable valuations and earnings growth in sectors like financials. It mentions that Apple's stock is already down 8% year to date, indicating negative sentiment. The article also highlights the impact of higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations, which could further pressure tech stocks like Apple. Given this context, the likelihood of Apple's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock price, indicating potential for a decline. The article's title 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' implies a bearish sentiment, which could lead to a decrease in stock price if investors react negatively to the information or outlook presented.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to potentially inflated tech expectations and higher bond yields. The article highlights that the 493 other stocks could post an 11% earnings growth this year, which may not be reflected in their current valuations. Additionally, the financials sector, which is part of the 493 stocks, is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter. This information implies that the focus might shift away from the 'Magnificent Seven' towards other stocks with potentially stronger growth prospects. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and the article implies a potential shift in investor focus, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news might be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

While Apple is known for its innovation and customer loyalty, a partner swap could lead to short-term disruptions in features and user experience. However, Apple's strong brand and ability to adapt suggest they can manage the transition effectively. The previous predictions leaned towards a stock price fall, with some models highlighting the potential negative impact on user sentiment and the disruption to Apple's financial products. Considering these factors, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so, as Apple's overall business remains robust.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple. While it highlights Apple as a 'timeless stalwart', it also notes that Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its Apple stake. This reduction, although potentially strategic, introduces uncertainty.  The article mentions Apple's foray into AI as a potential positive, but also points out stagnant revenue and iPhone sales.  The overall tone regarding Apple's recent performance is mixed.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely from a 30% to 55% probability of a price rise, and the mixed signals in the article itself, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, reflecting the potential for AI-driven growth to outweigh the concerns about stagnant revenue and reduced Berkshire holdings.  However, the uncertainty remains significant, preventing a strong prediction in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc.

Given this context, the likelihood of Apple's stock price falling seems higher than it rising in the short term. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, aligning with the negative sentiment and shift in focus away from tech giants.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock price. The various models' predictions indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising. The reasons include potential disruption from the Goldman Sachs partnership exit, shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, and mixed signals regarding Apple's recent performance. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and history of navigating challenges may mitigate the extent of the fall. Considering these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc.

The article mentions that Apple's stock is already down 8% year to date, indicating negative sentiment. Additionally, higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations could further pressure tech stocks like Apple. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which mostly indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the current market sentiment and potential shift in investor focus, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative approach to debt management, noting that it carries virtually no net debt. This suggests strong financial health and operational efficiency, which generally positively impacts investor confidence. However, the previous round predictions indicate a consistent trend of pessimism toward Apple's stock performance, influenced by factors such as the shift in investor focus away from major tech stocks and concerns around potential disruptions in financial services offerings. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current positive news about Apple's debt management, the probability of stock price rise is slightly higher than in previous rounds but still cautious.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
